Abstract Of the many materials and methodologies aimed at producing low-cost, efficient photovoltaic cells, inorganic–organic lead halide perovskite materials 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17
appear particularly promising for next-generation solar devices owing to their high power conversion efficiency. The highest efficiencies reported for perovskite solar cells so far have been obtained mainly with methylammonium lead halide materials 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 . Here we combine the promising—owing to its comparatively narrow bandgap—but relatively unstable formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI 3 ) with methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr 3 ) as the light-harvesting unit in a bilayer solar-cell architecture 13 . We investigated phase stability, morphology of the perovskite layer, hysteresis in current–voltage characteristics, and overall performance as a function of chemical composition. Our results show that incorporation of MAPbBr 3
into FAPbI 3
stabilizes the perovskite phase of FAPbI 3
and improves the power conversion efficiency of the solar cell to more than 18 per cent under a standard illumination of 100 milliwatts per square centimetre. These findings further emphasize the versatility and performance potential of inorganic–organic lead halide perovskite materials for photovoltaic applications.

Main An inorganic–organic lead halide perovskite is any material that crystallizes into an AMX 3
(where A is an organic ammonium cation, M is Pb or Sn, and X is a halide anion) structure. The size of cation A is critical for the formation of a close-packed perovskite structure; in particular, cation A must fit into the space composed of four adjacent corner-sharing MX 6
octahedra. Of the various inorganic–organic lead halide perovskite materials, methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI 3 ), with a bandgap of about 1.5–1.6 eV and a light absorption spectrum up to a wavelength of 800 nm, has been extensively used as a light harvester in solar cells. Several methods, including a one-step spin-coating method 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , a two-step sequential method 4 , and vapour deposition in a high-vacuum chamber 5 , have been used to prepare MAPbI 3
materials. Additionally, different device architectures such as planar 5 , 10
and mesostructured cells 1 , 7
have also been proposed. The highest power conversion efficiency 8 , 9 , 11
(PCE) so far, of 16% to 17%, was achieved for solution-processed MAPbI 3,
although 19.3% in a planar device architecture was recently obtained from a reverse-bias current–voltage ( I – V ) curve 12 . We note that a PCE measured 13 , 14 , 15
via a reverse-bias scan with the solar cells exhibiting a large-hysteresis
I – V
curve can be highly overestimated. We have already showed that chemical modification of the X site anions (for example, substitution of I with Br) of MAPbI 3
can tune the bandgaps to range between 1.5 eV and 2.3 eV by incorporating MAPbBr 3
(2.3 eV bandgap); this resulted in colour variation and PCE modulation 6 . In contrast, HC(NH 2 ) 2 PbI 3 , which contains formamidinium (FA) cations instead of methylammonium (MA) cations at the ‘A’ site of the AMX 3
perovskite structure, has a bandgap of 1.48 eV, with an absorption edge of 840 nm (refs
16 ,
17 ,
18 ). We expect that this reduced bandgap may allow absorption of photons over a broader solar spectrum. The structural and opto-electrical differences of MAPbI 3
and FAPbI 3
are likely to originate from the difference in ionic radius of the MA (1.8 Å) and FA ions (1.9–2.2 Å). In fact, the relative ionic radii of A, M and X in the AMX 3
perovskite structure have been widely used as a method of establishing the distortion of the MX 6
octahedron; in particular, a relatively smaller ion radius for X favours the formation of cubic structures 18 . However, the photovoltaic performance of FAPbI 3
has been reported to be lower than that of MAPbI 3
(refs
16 ,
17 ). In addition, the black perovskite-type polymorph (α-phase), which is stable at relatively high temperatures (above 160 °C), was observed to turn into the yellow FAPbI 3
polymorph (δ-phase) in an ambient humid atmosphere 17 . However, considering their suitable bandgap (which is lower than that in MAPbI 3 ), the performance of FAPbI 3
solar cells can be considerably improved by stabilizing the FAPbI 3
phase, improving the crystallinity, and optimizing the cell architecture. In this regard, Pellet
et al. 19
demonstrated an improved PCE using mixed cation lead iodide perovskites by gradually substituting MA with FA cations—which increases the absorption range by shifting it redwards, allowing for a higher current density—but the performance was still dominated by MAPbI 3
rather than FAPbI 3 . We have recently reported a 16.2% certified PCE obtained from the combination of MAPbI 3
and MAPbBr 3
with a bilayer architecture consisting of perovskite-infiltrated mesoporous-TiO 2
electrodes, and an extremely uniform and dense upper perovskite layer obtained by solvent engineering techniques 13 ; the absorption edge was below 770 nm. A strategy for extending the absorption range of solar light is thus to replace MAPbI 3
with FAPbI 3
in the combined composition of MAPbI 3
and MAPbBr 3 . Here we report the overall PCE and structural stability of (FAPbI 3 ) 1 −  x (MAPbBr 3 ) x , with the mole ratio
x
ranging between 0 and 0.3. We investigated the performance of systems containing different amounts of MAPbBr 3
incorporated into FAPbI 3 —that is, (FAPbI 3 ) 1 −  x (MAPbBr 3 ) x —by measuring their current density versus voltage ( J−V ).
Figure 1a
shows the PCEs obtained from the
J−V
curves for different (FAPbI 3 ) 1 −  x (MAPbBr 3 ) x
systems under standard air-mass 1.5 global (AM1.5G) illumination. The PCEs were averaged from the reverse (from the open-circuit voltage
V oc
to the short-circuit current
I sc ) and forward (from
I sc
to
V oc ) sweeps, because perovskite solar cells may experience a dependence of the measured efficiency on the scan direction. However, the hysteresis of the cells fabricated from FAPbI 3
and FAPbI 3
incorporating 15 mol% MAPbBr 3
was not relevant, even after collecting
J−V
curves with the relatively short scanning delay time of 40 ms ( Fig. 1b ). In addition, the small discrepancies related to the scan direction for the FAPbI 3 /MAPbBr 3
systems disappeared at longer delay times (above 100 ms). That the hysteresis observed in FAPbI 3 -based systems is negligible compared to the hysteresis in MAPbI 3
( Fig. 1b
inset) may be related to the balance between electron and hole transport within the perovskite layer. Figure 1: Characterization of materials. a , PCE values for cells using (FAPbI 3 ) 1 −  x (MAPbBr 3 ) x

Full size image As reported, the electron-diffusion length in MAPbI 3
( ∼ 130 nm) is 1.4 times larger than the hole-diffusion length ( ∼ 90 nm) 20 , while FAPbI 3
has a hole-diffusion length ( ∼ 813 nm) that is 4.6 times longer than the electron-diffusion length ( ∼ 177 nm) 16 . In addition, Kanatzidis
et al. 18
showed, by measuring the Seebeck coefficient, that MAPbI 3
and FAPbI 3
display an n-type and a p-type character, respectively. Since the incident light of the FTO/TiO 2 /perovskite/PTAA/Au (where FTO is fluorine-doped tin oxide and PTAA is poly(triarylamine)) cell configuration reaches the perovskite through the FTO side, more carriers are generated on the perovskite near TiO 2
than on the perovskite near PTAA. Therefore, many more holes than electrons should travel a long distance through the perovskite layer to the PTAA layer. This indicates that the balance between electron and hole transport in cells should be considered in compositional engineering for highly efficient perovskite solar cells. Data in
Table 1
show that the solar cell annealed at 100 °C with
x
= 0 exhibits considerably low
J sc ,
V oc
and fill factor (FF) values. In contrast, the overall PCE, including
J sc ,
V oc
and FF, noticeably increased when annealing was performed at 150 °C. The trend of PCE as a function of
x
in the cells fabricated with FAPbI 3 –MAPbBr 3
showed that
J sc
increases from 19.0 mA cm −2
(at
x
= 0.05) to a maximum value of 22 mA cm −2
(at
x
= 0.15); after this point,
J sc
decreases to 20 mA cm −2
(at
x
= 0.30). In this range,
V oc
increases from 1.0 V to 1.12 V. Interestingly, the FF showed exactly the same
J sc
behaviour with a maximum value of 73% at
x
= 0.15. Table 1 Photovoltaic parameters from (FAPbI 3 ) 1 −  x (MAPbBr 3 ) x Full size table The ultraviolet–visible absorption spectra displayed in
Fig. 1c
show a systematic shift of the absorption band edge to shorter wavelengths when the MAPbBr 3
content is increased. The reduction of
J sc
observed with
x
larger than 0.15 is directly related to the blue-shift of absorption onset, which in turn is responsible for the reduced light-harvesting efficiency. As expected, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum shown in
Fig. 1d
is blue-shifted when
x
is increased, resulting in the reduction of
J sc . However, a relatively lower
J sc , below
x
= 0.15, indicates that the charge-collection efficiency is also low, because
J sc
is proportional to the product of the charge-collection efficiency and the light-harvesting efficiency. The fact that the FF has a trend similar to that of
J sc
supports this, as confirmed by the considerably high series resistance shown below
x
= 0.15 (with annealing at 100 °C). The increase of
V oc
over the entire range studied in this work may be attributed to the widening of the bandgap, which occurs when
x
increases. Most importantly, the PCE of the solar cells fabricated in this study exhibits a maximum value of 17.3% at
x
= 0.15, owing to the simultaneous enhancement of
J sc
and FF, while
V oc
continues to increase (because the PCE is determined from the products of
J sc ,
V oc
and FF). To further elucidate possible reasons for such low values of
J sc
and
FF
below
x
= 0.15, we examined the phase stability of FAPbI 3 . It is known that FAPbI 3
is characterized by a reversible phase transition between two polymorphs, that is, a black perovskite with trigonal symmetry (space group
P 3 m 1) and a yellow non-perovskite with hexagonal symmetry ( P 6 3 mc ) 17 , 18 . The latter contains linear chains of [PbI 6 ] octahedrons with face-sharing, while the former consists of a three-dimensional network of corner-sharing octahedrons. Figure 2a
shows the results of the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis of a yellow FAPbI 3
powder heated at 300 °C. An endothermic peak around 160 °C was found with the DSC analysis, which appears without any weight loss up to 250 °C in the thermogravimetric analysis. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of the yellow powder measured
in situ
( Extended Data Fig. 1 ) suggest that the endothermic peak can be assigned to the phase transition from yellow non-perovskite to black perovskite, in agreement with previous studies 16 , 21 . This indicates that the yellow non-perovskite phase for the pure FAPbI 3
material is likely to be thermodynamically stable. This phase transition was also found to be reversible in air, that is, the prepared yellow non-perovskite phase changed to the black perovskite phase when annealing was performed at 170 °C; the black powder turned yellow again after being stored in air for 10 days ( Extended Data Fig. 2 ).

Full size image This unintentional phase transition in FAPbI 3
solar cells may reduce the photovoltaic performance, because the yellow phase is characterized by a large optical bandgap ( Fig. 1c ) and an inferior charge-transporting ability due to the linear chain-like [PbI 6 ] octahedron structure. Notably, AMX 3
(where A is Rb, Cs, MA or FA, M is Pb or Sn, and X is Cl, Br or I) metal trihalide materials exist as either two polymorphs (perovskite and non-perovskite) or only one of the two, depending on the atomic size of the components 22 . For example, in contrast to CsSnI 3 , which has two polymorphs, MASnI 3 , with larger MA +
cations, shows only a perovskite phase and no phase transition near room temperature ( ∼ 25 °C). RbSnI 3 , with smaller Rb +
cations, shows only a non-perovskite phase 22 , 23 , 24 . Therefore, the atomic combination of the A and X sites may lead to the stabilization of the FAPbI 3
perovskite structure. Figure 2b
shows the XRD spectra of the prepared FAPbI 3 , (FAPbI 3 ) 1 −  x (MAPbI 3 ) x , (FAPbI 3 ) 1 −  x (FAPbBr 3 ) x , and (FAPbI 3 ) 1 −  x (MAPbBr 3 ) x
films (with
x
= 0.15) on mesoporous-TiO 2 /blocking-TiO 2 /FTO glass substrates, after annealing at 100 °C for 10 min; these were prepared using the solvent-engineering process with precursor solutions of the desired compositions as previously reported 13 . The XRD spectrum of the pure FAPbI 3
thin film shows the typical diffraction pattern of a hexagonal non-perovskite polymorph of FAPbI 3
( P 6 3 mc ) 18 ; this can be detected from DSC ( Fig. 2a ), because the temperature of the annealing (100 °C) is much lower than the temperature (160 °C) at which the phase transition occurs. However, when FA +
cations in FAPbI 3
are substituted by 15 mol% of MA +
cations, a strong (111) diffraction peak at 13.9° for the trigonal perovskite phase ( P 3 m 1) appears in spite of the annealing at 100 °C. The same diffraction peaks are also observed in systems containing Br −
ions (15 mol%), although the secondary phase coexists in the film. Surprisingly, a simultaneous introduction of 15 mol% of both MA +
cations and Br −
anions in FAPbI 3
to obtain (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15
leads to a synergetic effect that stabilizes the perovskite phase. Interestingly, this is sufficient to form a FAPbI 3
perovskite phase even after incorporating 5 mol% of MAPbBr 3
( Extended Data Fig. 3 ), although the single MA +
or Br −
can only partially form a perovskite phase. We also found that a highly crystalline perovskite layer is formed with values of
x
larger than 0.15, according to the full width of half maximum (FWHM) of the (−111) diffraction peak ( Fig. 2c ). Therefore, we surmise that the enhancement of the phase stability and crystallinity results in an improvement of PCE in the
x
range of 0 to 0.15. The perovskite phase stabilization caused by the introduction of MAPbBr 3
to FAPbI 3
was also confirmed by an analysis carried out on the synthesized powders, which were prepared at room temperature by precipitation from solutions of FAPbI 3 , (FAPbI 3 ) 1 −  x (MAPbI 3 ) x , (FAPbI 3 ) 1 −  x (FAPbBr 3 ) x , and (FAPbI 3 ) 1 −  x (MAPbBr 3 ) x
with
x
= 0.15. Photographs of the as-prepared powders shown in
Extended Data Fig. 4
indicate that a black powder like as-prepared MAPbI 3
is obtained only for (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15 . In addition, the XRD spectra of the powders revealed that (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15 , in contrast to FAPbI 3 , shows a pure perovskite phase ( Extended Data Fig. 5 ), with no endothermic DSC peaks ( Fig. 2a ). This finding confirms that the co-substitution of MA to FA and Br to I can efficiently stabilize the perovskite phase. However, further investigation is required to determine the energetics of the perovskite and non-perovskite formation and to establish the composition of the stable form in perovskite halide materials. We recently successfully fabricated a complete bilayer on a mesoporous-TiO 2
using the solvent-engineering technology; our findings confirmed that surface coverage and morphology of perovskite materials is critical 13 . For this reason, here we analysed the surfaces deposited with different
x
values for MAPbBr 3 /FAPbI 3
using the solvent-engineering process.
Figure 2d
shows the surface scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of (FAPbI 3 ) 1 −  x (MAPbBr 3 ) x , with
x
= 0, 0.05 and 0.15, on a 200-nm-thick mesoporous-TiO 2 /blocking-TiO 2 /FTO annealed for 10 min at 150 °C ( x
= 0) and 100 °C, respectively. Our results showed that the surface of FAPbI 3
exhibits an irregular morphology with bumpy roughness. Incorporating MAPbBr 3
into FAPbI 3
(with
x
= 0.15) considerably smoothed the surface; however, systems characterized by
x
= 0.05 still presented large voids between crystal boundaries. The rough surface of FAPbI 3
may be due to the transition from non-perovskite to perovskite phases and to the high temperature required for the formation of the perovskite phase. Indeed, manipulating the composition of FAPbI 3
by adding MAPbBr 3
led to the stabilization of the perovskite phase with a uniform and dense morphology as well as well-developed crystallites, which are responsible for the highly improved cell performance. On the basis of these results, we repeated the fabrication procedure, fixing
x
to a value of 0.15 to enhance further the performance of the FAPbI 3 -MAPbBr 3
system with an architecture as follows: FTO/blocking-TiO 2
(70 nm)/mesoporous-TiO 2 :perovskite composite layer (200 nm)/perovskite upper layer (300 nm)/PTAA (50 nm)/Au (100 nm). Of the devices obtained,

J sc ,
V oc
and FF values averaged from the
J–V
curves of this device are 22.5 mA cm −2 , 1,105 mV and 73.2%, respectively; these correspond to a PCE of 18.4% under standard AM1.5G conditions. The PCE value is in agreement with that obtained from the stabilized power output near the maximum power point, reflecting the device performance in the working condition more closely ( Extended Data Fig. 6 ).

Full size image In the case of the cell using thinner mesoporous-TiO 2
layer (80 nm), as shown in
Extended Data Fig. 7 , although an unprecedented PCE of 20.3% was measured via reverse bias scan, the PCE of around 17.3% obtained from an average
J–V
curve and steady-state current measurement is far lower than that from the best cell using a 200-nm-thick mesoporous-TiO 2
layer, owing to the low PCE of 15.5% with forward bias scan. This result is similar to those of ref.
12
and implies that substantial PCE values should be obtained from
J–V
curves averaged with reverse and forward bias sweep.
Figure 3b
shows the EQE spectrum for one of the best-performing solar cells. A very broad EQE plateau of over 80% between 400 nm and 750 nm was observed. The
J sc
value integrated from EQE was found to be in good agreement with that measured by
J–V . The highly performing devices exhibiting PCEs of 18.0% with very small hysteresis was certified by the standardized method in the photovoltaic calibration laboratory, confirming a PCE of 17.9% under AM1.5G full sun ( Extended Data Fig. 8 ). To the best of our knowledge, such a PCE value is the highest ever reported for a perovskite-based solar cell, excluding the value overestimated by reverse bias scan. We have described the compositional engineering of (FAPbI 3 ) 1 −  x (MAPbBr 3 ) x
for efficient perovskite solar cells. (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15
has many advantages over other systems such MAPbI 3 , FAPbI 3 , and MAPb(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3 . This strategy may lead to more efficient and cost-effective inorganic–organic hybrid perovskite solar cells. Methods Materials Unless stated otherwise, all materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Junsei Organics and used as received. PTAA was purchased from EM Index. Synthesis of the TiO 2
paste The TiO 2
nanoparticles used in the paste were prepared by hydrothermal treatment at 250 °C for 12 h from aqueous solutions of the peroxotitanium complex, as described elsewhere 25 , 26 . The peroxotitanium complex solutions were synthesized via a reaction between hydrogen peroxide and the TiO(OH) 2
wet cake. The wet cake was obtained by the dropwise addition of a NH 4 OH solution into 0.33M TiOCl 2
aqueous solution obtained by the hydrolysis of TiCl 4 . The resulting cake was purified by repeated washing with deionized water until no Cl −
ions were detected. Then, 200 ml of 35 wt% hydrogen peroxide was added into 300 ml of a 2 wt% TiO(OH) 2 -dispersed aqueous solution such that the H 2 O 2 /Ti 4+
ratio was
∼ 40; the solution was constantly stirred in an ice bath. Once the addition of H 2 O 2
was completed, the colour of the precipitate changed from white to turbid yellowish, and finally light orange- or reddish-coloured transparent solutions were formed within 1 h. The TiO 2 -nanoparticle (average diameter 50 nm, anatase) slurry obtained by the hydrothermal treatment was stirred for 1 h, while several drops of concentrated nitric acid were added to obtain a colloidal dispersion solution. Then the TiO 2
nanoparticles were collected by the centrifugal method. The TiO 2
wet cake was re-dispersed and centrifuged in absolute ethanol by ultrasonic irradiation. The process with absolute ethanol was repeated for three cycles. The collected TiO 2
nanoparticles were dispersed in 100 ml of absolute ethanol, 4.5 g (per 1 g of TiO 2 ) of a 10 wt% ethanolic solution of ethyl cellulose (Fluka, 46070), and 4.4 g (per 1 g of TiO 2 ) of terpineol. After the addition of each component, the mix was stirred for 10 min and homogenized by ultrasonic irradiation. The paste was finally produced by a three-roller-mill grinder (EXAKT) after concentrating the mixture solution in a rotary evaporator. Synthesis of the inorganic–organic mixed perovskite CH 3 NH 3 I and NH 2 CH = NH 2 I were first synthesized by reacting 30 ml hydroiodic acid (57% in water, Aldrich), 27.86 ml CH 3 NH 2
(40% in methanol, Junsei Chemical), and 15 g formamidine acetate (Aldrich) in a 250 ml round-bottomed flask at 0 °C for 2 h with stirring. The precipitates were recovered by evaporating the solutions at 50 °C for 1 h. The products were dissolved in ethanol, recrystallized using diethyl ether, and finally dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h. Similarly, CH 3 NH 3 Br and NH 2 CH = NH 2 Br were prepared using hydrobromic acid (48 wt% in water, Aldrich) according to a reported procedure 27 . The desired solutions of FAPbI 3 , (FAPbI 3 ) 1 −  x (MAPbI 3 ) x , (FAPbI 3 ) 1 −  x (FAPbBr 3 ) x , and (FAPbI 3 ) 1 −  x (MAPbBr 3 ) x
(with
x
= 0–0.30) were prepared by dissolution of the CH 3 NH 3 I, CH 3 NH 3 Br, NH 2 CH = NH 2 I, and NH 2 CH = NH 2 Br powders with PbI 2
(Aldrich) and PbBr 2
(Aldrich) in the γ-butyrolactone:DMSO mixed solvent (7:3, volume ratio) at 60 °C for 10 min. Solar cell fabrication A dense blocking layer of TiO 2
(60 nm, blocking-TiO 2 ) was deposited onto an F-doped SnO 2
(FTO, Pilkington, TEC8) substrate by spray pyrolysis using a 20 mM titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution (Aldrich) at 450 °C; this was done to prevent a direct contact between FTO and the hole-conducting layer. A 200-nm-thick mesoporous-TiO 2
was spin-coated onto the blocking-TiO 2 /FTO substrate using TiO 2
pastes diluted in 2-methoxyethanol (1 g in 5 ml) and calcinated at 500 °C for 1 h in air to remove the organic components. The inorganic–organic lead halide perovskite solutions were then coated onto the mesoporous-TiO 2 /blocking-TiO 2 /FTO substrate by two consecutive spin-coating steps, at 1,000 rpm and 5,000 rpm for 40 s and 20 s, respectively. During the second spin-coating step, 1 ml toluene was poured onto the substrate, according to the procedure reported in ref.
13 . To obtain a uniform and flat intermediate-phase film, toluene should be quickly cast in one-shot mode on a rapidly rotating (at 5,000 rpm) substrate to wash out the surplus of DMSO molecules that did not participate in the formation of the PbI 2 –NH 2 CH = NH 2 I–DMSO complex. The substrate was then dried on a hot plate at 100 °C or 150 °C for 10 min. A solution of PTAA (EM Index, [Mn] = 17,500 g mol −1 )/toluene (10 mg ml −1 ) with an additive of 7.5 µl Li-bis(trifluoromethanesulphonyl) imide/acetonitrile (170 mg ml −1 ) and 4 µl 4- tert -butylpyridine was spin-coated on the perovskite layer/mesoporous-TiO 2 /blocking-TiO 2 /FTO substrate at 3,000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, an Au counter electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation; the active area of this electrode was fixed at 0.16 cm 2 . The different inorganic–organic lead halide triiodide powders were prepared by precipitation using toluene at room temperature from the desired compositional solutions obtained by dissolving CH 3 NH 3 I, CH 3 NH 3 Br, NH 2 CH = NH 2 I and NH 2 CH = NH 2 Br powders with PbI 2
and PbBr 2
in γ-butyrolactone. Characterization The XRD spectra of the prepared films were measured using a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer; the
in situ
XRD experiment of the as-prepared FAPbI 3
yellow powder was performed using a Rigaku Ultima IV with an X-ray tube (Cu Kα, wavelength
λ
= 1.5406 Å). Ultraviolet–visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV 2550 spectrophotometer in the 300–800 nm wavelength range at room temperature. The morphology of the films was observed using a field-emission SEM (MIRA3 LMU, Tescan). Thermogravimetric and DSC analyses of the as-prepared powders were performed with a heating rate of 2 °C min −1
from room temperature up to 300 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere using TA Instruments SDT 2960 and DSC 2910, respectively. EQE was measured by a power source (Newport 300W Xenon lamp, 66920) with a monochromator (Newport Cornerstone 260) and a multimeter (Keithley2001). The
J–V
curves were measured using a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Class A, 91195A) with a source meter (Keithley 2420) at 100 mA cm −2
AM1.5G illumination and a calibrated Si-reference cell certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, USA. The
J–V
curves were measured by reverse scan (forward bias (1.2 V) → short circuit (0 V)) or forward scan (short circuit (0 V) → forward bias (1.2 V)). The step voltage was fixed at 10 mV and the delay time, which is a delay set at each voltage step before measuring each current, was modulated. The
J–V
curves for all devices were measured by masking the active area with a metal mask (area of 0.096 cm 2 ).

Editorial Summary High-performance perovskites solar cells Inorganic–organic lead halide perovskites are currently attracting considerable interest for solar-cell applications. Most of the best performing perovskite solar cells to date have made use of methylammonium-based perovskites; formamidinium-based perovskites have also shown promise, but are not as stable. Now Nam Joong Jeon and colleagues show that the formamidinium-based perovskites can be stabilized by the addition of some methylammonium-based perovskite, and that solar cells incorporating the resulting compositionally tuned materials can reach new heights of efficiency. show all

Abstract The emergence of methyl-ammonium lead halide (MAPbX3) perovskites motivates the identification of unique properties giving rise to exceptional bulk transport properties, and identifying future materials with similar properties. Here, we propose that this “defect tolerance” emerges from fundamental electronic-structure properties, including the orbital character of the conduction and valence band extrema, the chargecarrier effective masses, and the static dielectric constant. We use MaterialsProject.org searches and detailed electronic-structure calculations to demonstrate these properties in other materials than MAPbX3. This framework of materials discovery may be applied more broadly, to accelerate discovery of new semiconductors based on emerging understanding of recent successes.

Introduction Many semiconductors have been studied over the last century for their possible use in photovoltaics (PVs), light-emitting diodes (LEDs), computing devices, sensors, and detectors. Of these, only a select few have achieved sufficient optoelectronic performance to transition into industrial manufacturing, and their identification and development have been slow and mostly empirical. Recently, high-throughput computation and a deeper understanding of the physics-based requirements for high performance have created the potential for an accelerated identification of functional materials with manufacturing potential. For example, materials screening criteria have been proposed to better focus the search for novel candidate PV materials; they include the optical band-gap energy[ 1 , 2 ] and abruptness of absorption onset,[ 3 , 4 ] in addition to boundary conditions of elemental abundance,[ 5 ] and manufacturing cost.[ 6 , 7 ] However, many materials have met these criteria and yet have not achieved industrially relevant conversion efficiencies (in excess of 10–15%) due to low minority-carrier lifetimes or diffusion lengths, e.g., in the case of Cu 2 ZnSn(S,Se) 4 ,[ 8 ] SnS,[ 9 ] and others.[ 10 ] Meanwhile, PV devices have emerged based on methyl-ammonium lead iodide (MAPbI 3 ) and closely related halides (herein referred to as MAPb X 3 ). MAPbI 3
is a semiconductor, which has demonstrated exceptional minority-carrier lifetimes of 280 ns (in the mixed iodide-chloride composition)[ 11 ] and diffusion lengths up to 175 µm,[ 12 ] comparable with the best single-crystal semiconductors. This, in addition to meeting the criteria above, has resulted in a dramatic realization of PV conversion efficiencies up to 20.1%[ 13 , 14 ] in 2015, from <4% in 2009.[ 15 ] This paper examines whether the dramatic success of MAPb X 3
in PVs can be used as a basis to expand design criteria to identify new potential high-performance optoelectronic materials. One of the most compelling questions engendered by MAPb X 3
as an optoelectronic material is the degree to which it is unique, and whether its success can lead to the identification of materials with improved stability and lower toxicity, yet similar high performance. Clearly, as in previous design criteria the high optical absorption coefficient is important, but also essential are the long carrier diffusion lengths observed in MAPb X 3 , enabled by high minority-carrier lifetime ( τ ) and mobility ( µ ).[ 11 , 16 , 17 ] The importance of
τ
and
µ
for device performance has been established[ 18 ] for the most highly performing PV materials, including silicon,[ 19 ] cadmium telluride,[ 20 , 21 ] copper indium gallium diselenide,[ 22 ] and gallium arsenide.[ 23 ] Oddly, these more direct transport parameters,
τ
and
µ , are not traditionally considered essential screening criteria for novel candidate PV materials. This may be partially a consequence of the difficulty in measuring and/or calculating these parameters. The direct measurement of minority carrier
τ
and
µ
requires ultrafast electronic or optical sensors to capture transients,[ 24 – 27 ] or strong steady-state signals,[ 28 , 29 ] and must be performed with PV-device-relevant illumination conditions, electrical fields, and transport directions. Calculating
τ
and
µ
from first-principles is even more challenging, given the lack of well-established and high-throughput methods to directly calculate electron-phonon interactions and/or trap capture cross-sections. Although it is possible to obtain some information about carrier mobility from effective masses, and maximum radiative lifetime from the band structure, these are known to be insufficient and can be misleading when point and structural defects limit these transport properties.[ 18 ] In this paper, we use established recombination models to identify the underlying electronic-structure parameters of MAPb X 3
that are likely to underpin the high experimentally observed
τ
and
µ , including: dielectric constant, effective mass, band bonding character, and band dispersion (i.e., band extrema relative to vacancy levels). We illustrate how these parameters can be computationally accessible using established variants of density functional theory (DFT). Using the basic properties of MAPb X 3
to define a set of search criteria, we discuss the potential to identify other novel materials with “defect-tolerant” transport properties, starting with the database at MaterialsProject.org.[ 30 ] This may yield materials with similar performance, but enhanced stability and lower toxicity.
Redefining search criteria for defect-tolerant semiconductors This section discusses the emerging explanations for high performance in MAPbI 3
and closely related materials, focusing on the unique aspects that make their performance exceptional: specifically their long non-radiative minority-carrier lifetime, even in the presence of defects. A “defect tolerant” material is expected to either (a) form relatively few intrinsic or structural defects under high-throughput, low-temperature processing conditions, and/or more importantly (b) the extrinsic, intrinsic, or structural defects that do form have a very minimal effect on
µ
and
τ . We discuss models of how a material may achieve this defect tolerance, and suggest by example that the underlying electronic-structure properties may not be unique to MAPb X 3 , but rather be shared in a broader class of compounds.
Explanations for high performance in methylammonium lead iodide and related materials Many authors have proposed explanations for the success of MAPb X 3
as a PV material. These include its large absorption coefficient, long electron and hole diffusion lengths, low exciton-binding energies, low effective masses and high mobilities, and the presence of only shallow defects in the band gap.[ 11 , 16 , 17 , 31 , 32 ] The existence of only shallow defects, and the disperse valence band, have both been tied to the presence of filled Pb 6s orbitals, deriving from the partial oxidation of Pb relative to its Pb 4+
oxidation state. This orbital character has been identified by several authors, and explains both the shallow binding energy of defects and the atypical dependence of band gap on strain or temperature in MAPbI 3 .[ 33 – 35 ] This model for explaining the defect-tolerance and shallow defects has direct analogy to those developed earlier for CuInSe 2 [ 36 ] and Cu 3 N,[ 37 ] where instead the Cu +
cation contributes 3 d
Cu antibonding states to the valence band. In addition, device-level observations support the claims that MAPbI 3
has excellent transport properties, including long carrier diffusion lengths significantly exceeding 1 µm,[ 11 ] and recently, up to 175 µm in single crystals.[ 12 , 38 ] Low non-radiative minority-carrier recombination rates are also supported by measurements of high photoluminescence quantum yield,[ 39 ] long carrier lifetimes,[ 10 ] and the high open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) demonstrated by many devices. These properties are made more exceptional by the way in which MAPbI 3
is processed: low-temperature solution processing results in equal or better performance to vacuum synthesis, which runs contrary to the higher purity, higher temperature, and more equipment-intensive fabrication strategies used to obtain high performance in conventional crystalline semiconductor materials. We substantiate these earlier reports by applying DFT to MAPbI3. In the model pioneered by Zhang,[ 36 ] as well as Lany and Zakutayev,[ 37 ] defect tolerance emerges from having bonding orbitals at the conduction band minimum (CBM), and antibonding orbitals at the valence band maximum (VBM). This band structure is markedly different than that in most semiconductors, where the valence band is composed predominantly of bonding states, whereas the conduction band is composed of wavefunctions with dominant antibonding character. The defect tolerance that emerges from such an electronic structure is easily described using atomic vacancies as examples. Namely, if predominantly antibonding orbitals occur at the VBM and bonding at the CBM, the dangling (broken) bonds that are formed upon creating the vacancy (of any kind) will likely appear as resonances inside the bands, leaving the band gap free of deep states that could act as carrier traps. As shown in Fig.
1
for the valence band of MAPbI3, this is a consequence of the position of valence atomic orbitals relative to the bonding and antibonding bands formed due to interactions. Analogous arguments are also valid for other types of intrinsic defects, such as interstitials and/or antisites, as well as for structural defects such as grain boundaries, which consist of many strained and dangling bonds. Extrinsic impurities could, however, still introduce deep traps inside the band gap depending on the position of their atomic orbitals relative to the energy bands of the host material.

42
(1.85 eV computed using the many body GW method with SO included). The MA +
cation does not introduce states at the band edge. Full size image These situations, in particular the antibonding character of the VBM, can frequently be found in metal-non-metal systems with partially oxidized cations such as binary group-III halides or group-IV chalcogenides in 1:1 stoichiometry (e.g., TlBr and SnTe). Owing to the partial oxidation of Pb, the MAPbI3 compound also exhibits similar electronic-structure features.[ 41 ] As shown in Fig.
1 , there are three types of interactions that contribute to the valence band in MAPbI 3 . The first results from the overlap of Pb(6 p )–I(5 p ) atomic orbitals leading to the creation of the deeper portion of the valence band, which is predominantly of I(5 p ) character, and the bottom part of the conduction band, which is composed mostly of Pb(6 p ) atomic orbitals. This interaction is responsible for chemical bonding as it implies charge transfer from the Pb(6 p ) to the I(5 p ) orbitals. In addition, Pb(6s)–I(5 p ) interaction leads to the creation of two bands: a deeper valence band (bonding), and the antibonding maximum of the valence band. Finally, only one of the I(5 p ) orbitals is oriented along the Pb–I bond, which is a favorable direction to interact with Pb(6 s ) and Pb(6 p ). The other two, oriented orthogonally, can only interact with the 5 p
orbitals from other iodine atoms forming the middle of the valence band as shown in Fig.
1 . As a result of these interactions, the electronic band gap is formed between the antibonding top of the valence band originating from the Pb(6 s )–I(5 p ) interactions and the antibonding CBM resulting from the Pb(6 p )–I(5 p ) interactions. Bonding-type defect-tolerance arguments can therefore only be applied to the defects that would tend to create valence band-derived states such as cation (Pb or MA) vacancies. On the other hand, if anion (iodine) vacancies form, the resulting dangling bonds will appear as resonances inside the conduction band only if the bandwidth and the dispersion of the conduction band are such that the CBM falls well below the energy of the Pb(6 p)
atomic orbitals. In the case of Pb, contrary to Sn and Ge compounds for example, this condition is more likely due to relativistic[ 43 ] SO interaction effects that increase the width of the Pb(6 p ) conduction band by ~2 eV based on our calculations. Thus, the fact that vacancy-type defects in MAPbI 3
are resonant in the bands is attributed to: (a) the presence of antibonding orbitals within the valence band that push the VBM energy up, and (b) relativistic effects which push the CBM energy down. In summary, an emerging conclusion from both experimental measurements and first-principles calculations is that MAPb X 3
benefits from an inherently defect-tolerant electronic structure.
Modeling electronic transport in the presence of defects To provide physical context for the claims above, and to translate them into electronic-structure design criteria, we focus on transport models in defective materials: in particular, models for defect-assisted
µ
and
τ . These are semiconductor models (distinct from the Langevin recombination model, which is inappropriate for MAPbI 3 ).[ 40 ] Defect-limited, monomolecular, or trap-assisted non-radiative recombination,
U SRH , is modeled by Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination statistics:
$${U_{{\text{SRH}}}} = \frac{{np - n_i^2}}{{{\tau _{0,{\text{h}}}}\left( {n + {n_1}} \right) + {\tau _{0,{\text{e}}}}\left( {p + {p_1}} \right)}},$$
((1))
where
n, p,
and
n i
are the electron, hole, and intrinsic carrier concentrations, respectively.[ 44 ] The low-injection electron and hole lifetimes
τ 0,e
and
τ 0,h , which we seek to maximize, are:
$${\tau _{0,{\text{h}}}} = \frac{1}{{{N_t}{\sigma _{{\text{t,h}}}}{v_{{\text{th,h}}}}}}{\text{and}}{\tau _{0,{\text{e}}}} = \frac{1}{{{N_t}{\sigma _{{\text{t,e}}}}{v_{{\text{th,e}}}}}},$$
((2))
where
N t
is the trap density,
σ t
is the capture cross-section for electrons or holes, and
v th
is the drift velocity of carriers. At low injection conditions, the hole and electron lifetimes tend toward
τ h
=
τ 0,h
and
τ e
=
τ 0,e , respectively; at high-injection conditions, both hole and electron lifetimes tend toward
τ h
=
τ e
=
τ 0,h
+
τ 0,e . The terms
n 1
and
p 1
reflect the occupancy of trap states, where
E t
is the energy level of the trap state and
E i
the Fermi level in the intrinsic material (near mid-gap):
((3))
From this model, three conditions are necessary to limit SRH (trap-assisted) recombination: defect energy levels far from mid-gap, as these exponentially impact lifetime; low trap density
N t ; and low capture cross-sections
σ . Operating in high-injection conditions is helpful (where photogenerated carrier concentrations greatly exceed background doping densities), especially when strongly injection-dependent defects limit lifetime.
E t
and
N t
may be calculated from first-principles; however, this calculation is computationally expensive, so we seek more fundamental electronic properties accessible by high-throughput screening. The first, and most important property is the relative static permittivity, or dielectric constant
ε r . A higher dielectric constant indicates a greater ability to screen charge, and may arise from electronic or ionic contributions, as well as the methylammonium molecular dipoles in the lattice.[ 45 ] This screening means that the capture cross-section of a charged defect will be influenced by the dielectric constant. Assuming a Coulombic model for capture cross-section, a capture event will occur when the electrostatic potential energy from a charged defect exceeds the thermal energy, kT, which occurs at a specific radius,[ 46 ] therefore:
((4))
where
q
is the elementary charge, and
ε 0
is the vacuum permittivity. MAPbI 3
has demonstrated a large static dielectric constant of 60–70 or higher,[ 16 , 47 , 48 ] due to electronic, ionic, and molecular dipole contributions from the organic cation.[ 49 ] This charge screening is very beneficial, given the inverse square dependence of carrier capture cross-section, and in turn recombination rate, on the dielectric constant. In addition, for a simple “hydrogenic” defect under Effective Mass Theory, the energy level of the defect sits deeper in the gap for lower dielectric constants,[ 44 ] i.e. the binding energy of a donor relative to the conduction band,
E C
is:
((5))
where
m * e
is the effective mass of an electron, and
ℏ
is the reduced Planck constant. Similar charge screening behavior has been used to explain the low binding energy of excitons in MAPbI 3 [ 45 ] and shallow effective mass-like states.[ 50 ] More important, however, is the energy level of non-effective-mass like traps formed by vacancies and structural defects. As discussed above, band structures containing antibonding orbitals in the VBM, bonding in the CBM, and/or high dispersion within a band can lead to shallower defects, as defect energy levels are resonant with the conduction or valence bands. A second model proposed to explain the lack of deep trap states is that MAPbI3 is more ionic than other semiconductors,[ 50 ] resulting in shallower or fewer defect states associated with dangling bonds. Analogous arguments have been made to explain defect tolerance in GaN[ 51 ] and (Cd, Zn)Te.[ 52 ] The second critical transport property is the minority-carrier mobility, which is influenced by the effective masses of free carriers and by the frequency of scattering events. The lower the effective mass, or the more disperse the band edges, the higher the mobility. However, in typical polycrystalline materials at room temperature, the mobility will not reach this intrinsic limit due to several forms of scattering. One way in which the mobility will be limited is by charged defect scattering, either at ionized impurities or grain boundaries. Again, a high dielectric constant reduces the spatial extent and the potential barrier of a charged defect, lowering its propensity to scatter free carriers. For ionized impurities, the mobility
µ H,ii
is given by:
((6))
where
r H,ii
is the Hall coefficient for ionized impurity scattering,
Z
is the charge on the ionized site,
N t
is the trap density,
b
= 24 m*kT/ℏ 2 β S 2 , and
β S
is the inverse screening length.[ 53 ] Thus, to reduce the impact of ionized impurities on mobility, it is again ideal to have a high dielectric constant, low effective mass, and low trap density. Grain boundary scattering is also reduced for larger dielectric constants, and when the defect levels associated with grain boundaries become shallower.[ 54 ] Alternatively, the mobility limit may come from phonon scattering. The phonon-limited mobility is generally smaller in softer materials, given their higher concentration of phonons at a given temperature—the bulk modulus,
B , and phonon-limited mobility
µ ph
are correlated,[ 55 ] where
A 0
is a constant:
$${\mu _{{\text{ph}}}} = {A_0}B{\left( {m*} \right)^{ - 2.5}} \cdot $$
((7))
MAPbI 3
is a relatively soft material, with a bulk modulus predicted to be 22.2 GPa for the cubic phase.[ 56 ] This may explain why its mobility, measured about 10 cm
2 /V/s,[ 40 ] is not large relative to III–V and group IV semiconductors. Claims of “high” mobilities may be relative to dyes and organic absorber materials from which much of the perovskite PV work derived. Thus, similar to the absorption coefficient of MAPbI 3 , its mobility is necessary but insufficient to explain its high performance. To compare these proposed performance criteria for PV, the ratio of the diffusion length to the absorption length in an absorber material must be maximized to produce high photocurrent in a PV device, as in this non-dimensional figure of merit[ 57 ]:
$$v = \frac{{{k_B}T}}{q}\mu \tau {\alpha ^2},$$
((8))
while historical PV screening approaches have focused on maximizing
α ; here instead we focus on
τ . Given that the mobility and absorption coefficient are good, but not exceptional for MAPbI 3 , we suggest that it is the minority-carrier lifetime of MAPbI 3
that is most strongly responsible for its exceptional performance. Finally, it is worth mentioning that beyond point and structural defects, a disordered crystal structure can limit the conversion efficiency by introducing defect states near the band edges (Urbach tail). MAPbI 3
demonstrates a very small Urbach tail energy.[ 58 ] This may be due to its low melting temperature, such that the material develops more crystalline order at lower processing temperatures (high homologous temperatures).[ 16 ] To review, we summarize the priorities for high-performance PV absorbers in Fig.
2 . While prior work has focused on screening for optical properties, we focus specifically on electronic-structure properties that have a direct impact on transport, highlighted in bold.
Toward ideal electronic structure: the importance of partially oxidized, heavy post-transition metals Materials that contain a lone 6 s 2
or 5 s 2
pair of electrons on the cation have the potential to share the high dielectric constant, low effective masses, and VB antibonding character that lead to defect tolerant transport properties. As a broad class, these are compounds formed from partially oxidized post-transition metals including In, Sn, Sb, Tl, Pb, and Bi. In the case of MAPbI 3 , the partially oxidized Pb atom in its Pb 2+
charge state lends these beneficial properties—a large, polarizable cation leads to high Born effective charge and therefore large dielectric constants,[ 35 ] as well as a conduction band with greater bandwidth due to SO coupling, while filled 6 s
orbitals lead to a disperse valence band (low effective mass)[ 32 ] and antibonding orbital character in the VBM. Other partially oxidized post-transition metals including In + , Sn 2+ , Sb 3+ , Tl + , Pb 2+ , and Bi 3+
share these properties, and are present in a wide variety of materials. This
N- 2 oxidation state is more commonly observed for compounds of Tl, Pb, and Bi, due to relativistic effects leading to tighter binding of the remaining s electrons; however, lighter cations may also be stabilized in these oxidation states. Given their many beneficial properties, these cations appear increasingly in many optoelectronic applications: PbS and lead halide perovskites in PV; TlBr, PbI 2 , and BiI 3
in x-ray detectors and scintillators[ 59 ]; Sn 2+ -based TCOs[ 60 ]; and Pb- and Bi-based ferroelectrics, photoferroelectrics,[ 61 ] piezoelectrics,[ 62 ] and thermoelectrics. For the thallous halides, analogous 6 s 2 6 p 0
orbital explanations for low effective mass, antibonding VBM states, and a high dielectric constant were offered several years before similar work on MAPb X 3 .[ 63 , 64 , 65 ]
Figure 2. Screening criteria for high-performance PV materials, focusing on the properties that enable excellent bulk transport in the presence of defects. Optical properties and scalability concerns have previously been emphasized in screening, and are important but insufficient to achieve high performance. Full size image To identify promising materials in this class, we developed a script to search through all materials in the Materials Project. org (MP) database.[ 30 ] This is implemented using the Materials Project API and the pymatgen library, to access information on calculated crystal and electronic structure for all compounds in the database.[ 66 ] This search examines approximately 27,000 non-metallic inorganic compounds with full band structures calculated, and extracts information on crystallographic point group, stability, band structure, and in particular the fractional DOS by element and orbital. To screen for the properties described above, we calculate the
s -orbital fraction in the top 1 eV of the valence band DOS. This metric is a rough filter, and may mistakenly identify materials with band-inversion, as well as many metal hydrides and Au −
compounds, wherein the anion species contributes a filled
s
orbital at the valence band edge. In Fig.
3 , we compare a random subset of the materials identified in this broad search, and note the stark differences in VBM DOS character for different classes of materials. Conventional tetrahedrally coordinated III–V and II–VI compounds all demonstrate almost exclusive
p -orbital character at the VBM, as do the majority of compounds. Other defect tolerant Cu-chalcogenide semiconductors, such as CuInSe 2 , demonstrate a large
d -orbital character in the valence band due to full 3 d
cation orbitals. Meanwhile, the inorganic I–II–VII 3
family of perovskites sit along the bottom axis, reflecting their larger
s -orbital fraction in the valence band DOS. However, they are not unique in this property. In addition, we plot a random fraction (30%) of the Materials Project Sn-cation compounds on these axes as well, separating them by those with Sn 2+
and Sn 4+
cations. The Sn 2+
cation-compounds cluster in the same region as the halide perovskites, whereas Sn 4+
compounds resemble the vast majority of semiconductors with anion
p -orbital or transition metal cation
d -orbital character.
Figure 3. Ternary plots demonstrating the partial DOS of the VBM by orbital type, for a wide range of randomly selected materials. Overlayed on the left are the conventional zincblende and wurtzite semiconductors for PV, as well as Cu-chalcogenides showing higher
d -orbital fraction, and the halide perovskites with higher s-orbital fraction. On the right, Sn-containing compounds demonstrate a distinct split along two axes, with Sn 2+
compounds demonstrating similar character to the halide perovskites. Full size image Finding good candidate semiconductors with the
N -2 oxidation state is not straightforward, for several reasons. Firstly, the use of more electronegative anions (oxygen, fluorine, and chlorine) tends to fully oxidize these cations. By pairing them with sulfur, selenium, iodine, and bromine, or by including a less electronegative cation such as an alkali metal, it is possible to stabilize the lower oxidation state. Secondly, the lone s orbitals are often stereochemically active,[ 67 ] leading to lower symmetry point groups, and a higher likelihood of indirect gaps. For example, for Sn compounds from the Materials Project database, only 29% of those with Sn 2+
are found to have direct band gaps, whereas for Sn 4+ , 47% have direct band gaps. Anisotropic crystal structures may also lead to anisotropic transport properties and surface potentials,[ 68 ] which may adversely influence device performance. Lastly, these cations may convert to the higher oxidation states inadvertantly, when exposed to oxidizers such as oxygen or moisture. In CsSnI 3
and MASnI 3 , this Sn 4+
formation results in metallic behavior with very high carrier concentrations.[ 34 , 69 ] Lastly, we note that all of the materials identified in the MaterialsProject.org search are inorganic, and we recognize the important role that the asymmetric, molecular cations such as methylammonium play in achieving large dielectric constants in these materials. Converting the inorganic materials identified herein into hybrid organic-inorganic analogues could lead to improved defect tolerance, but the presence of MA or other molecular cations is not the most important criteria in achieving defect tolerance. Thus, replacement of Pb in MAPb X 3
with transition metal cations may not yield high-performing semiconductors.
Outlook: identifying other promising materials classes with excellent transport properties By filtering the materials data drawn from the Materials Project database, we focus on several interesting classes that may share the beneficial properties identified above. Our search first identifies the class of halide perovskites (CsPbI 3 , CsSnI 3 , RbPbBr 3 , etc.); to our knowledge prior optoelectronic screening efforts have not identified these as promising materials. In the list below, we exclude Pb 2+
and Tl + -containing compounds based on toxicity; there are many promising optoelectronic materials containing these atoms. Unfortunately, the beneficial properties of Pb 2+
and Tl +
are also connected to their toxicity, as they mimic the large ionic sizes of Ca 2+
and K +
in the human body. This excludes the binary lead and thallium halides and chalcogenides such as TlBr, as well as a number of ternary chalcohalides or chalcogenides such as TlBiS 2 . In addition, this search is limited to materials existing in the MaterialsProject.org database. New materials may be discovered or designed using the present framework, for example the recently discovered Bi 2 FeCrO 6
perovskite,[ 70 ] which achieves an unusually small band gap for a complex oxide ferroelectric, and promising PV performance. We compute the electronic structure from first-principles for several classes of materials, which were identified through the broad computational survey. These classes are described below:
(i)
Binary chalcogenides and halides
(BiI 3 , Bi 2 S 3 , SbI 3 , Sb 2 S 3 , SnI 2 , InI, etc.): There are many binary iodides, sulfides, and selenides formed with
ns 2 np 0
cations, several of which have band gaps in the range of interest for PV. Those with band gaps 1.7 eV and greater, such as BiI 3 , PbI 2 , and TlBr, have been demonstrated successfully in x-ray detecting and scintillator applications, with high
µτ
products.[ 59 , 63 , 71 ]
(ii)
Binary halides, sulfides, and selenides stabilized in cubic structures such as NaCl and CsCl:
Given the anisotropic transport properties that result from stereochemically active lone pairs in materials such as SnS, more promising materials may result by stabilizing them in higher symmetry phases. Recently, it was demonstrated that SnS and SnSe may be stabilized in the NaCl structure by alloying with CaS.[ 72 ] Similarly, TlI may be stabilized in the CsCl phase by alloying,[ 73 ] suggesting a possible similar route with InI.
(iii)
Chalcohalides
(BiOI, BiSI, BiSeI, SbSI, SbSeI, BiSBr, BiSeBr, etc.): The
ns 2 np 0
chalcohalides (V–VI–VII compounds) range over visible to UV band gaps,[ 74 ] and many demonstrate ferroelectric behavior at lower temperatures as well. Both Sb- and Bi-containing varieties have demonstrated photoconductive or PV effects.[ 75 – 78 ] SbSI and SbSeI have recently been identified for their potential applications as photoferroelectrics[ 79 ]; however, those in the paraelectric phase may still demonstrate large Born effective charge, and a large static dielectric constant.
(iv)
Ternary alkali chalcogenides
(LiBiS 2 , NaBiS 2 , KBiS 2 , RbBiS 2 , CsBiS 2 , etc.): Similar to the formation of I–III–VI 2
analogues of the zincblende II–VI compounds, one may form I–III–VI 2
rocksalt compounds based on the PbS and PbSe rocksalt phases.[ 80 – 82 ] These include Pb-free chalcogenides with an octahedrally coordinated Bi 3+
cation.
(v)
Ternary halides:
(In 3 SnI 5 , InAlI 4 , etc.): In +
and Tl +
may be stabilized by several non-coordinating molecular anions such as
\({\text{AlI}}_4^ - \) .[ 83 ] In addition, multiple cations can be stabilized in their lower oxidation states together, as in Sn 2+
and In +
in the case of In 3 SnI 5 .
(vi)
In + –II–VII 3
ternary halides
(CdInBr 3 , CaInBr 3 , etc.): In +
is also stabilized in a number of In – II – VII 3
compounds, which appear to have band gaps outside of the range for PV, but which may exhibit similar defect tolerant properties.
(vii)
Bismides and antimonides
(e.g., KSnSb): Sn 2+
and other partially oxidized cations are stabilized in several bismides and antimonides, most of which have band gaps too small for PV absorbers under 1-Sun illumination.
(viii)
Octahedrally coordinated metal halides
(Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 , Rb 3 Bi 2 I 9 ,K 3 Bi 2 I 9 ,Cs 3 Sb 2 I 9 , etc.): Bi 3+
and Sb 3+
form
\({\text{II}}{{\text{I}}_{\text{2}}}{{\text{X}}_{\text{9}}}^{3 - }\)
anions that consist of edge or face-sharing octahedra, bonding with alkali metals to form a variety of materials with different band gaps, crystal structures, and ferroelectric phase transitions.[ 84 – 87 ]
(ix)
Cs-containing compounds substituting 1+ molecular cations
[e.g., (MA) 3 Bi 2 I 9 , (FA) 3 Bi 2 I 9 , etc.]: Lastly, we can identify a variety of Cs-containing materials, which could be converted to hybrid materials by the substitution of the Cs with an alkylammonium or other molecular cation.[ 86 , 88 ] A simple example is the family containing (MA) 3 Bi 2 I 9
or (FA) 3 Bi 2 I 9
(with formamidinium as the organic cation). A number of other molecular cations may be substituted as well based on size, analogous to the substitution explored in MAPb X 3 ,[ 89 , 90 ] to tune the band gap or to form lower-dimensional structures.
As an illustration, we perform first-principles (DFT) calculations on some of the above-listed materials to probe whether these materials have low effective masses and high static dielectric constants, in addition to containing cation antibonding orbitals in the VB, and compare these results with those of MAPbI 3 . These DFT results are summarized in Table
I , including the band gap ( E G ), relative valence band ( E V ) and conduction band energies ( E C ), effective masses
m*
for holes and electrons from the DOS, the band degeneracy at the CBM and VBM extrema, and the ionic dielectric constant. DFT calculations are performed with SO coupling; we compare the band extrema energies with and without SO coupling to demonstrate the relativistic effects. DFT is known to consistently under-predict the band gap, thus, we do not present the electronic component of the dielectric constant. Instead, we present only the ionic dielectric constant computed from density functional perturbation theory. In addition, the band-gap values, both the minimum and the direct gap, are given to provide an indication of the type of optical transition at the lowest energy gap. The larger the difference between the minimal and the direct gap, the weaker the absorption onset is. More information on these calculations is supplied in the Methods section.
Table I. DFT-computed band structures, band dispersion (with SO coupling), effective masses, and ionic dielectric constants for several compounds of interest, as compared with the (MA)B X 3
family of perovskites. Full size image It is important to draw attention to several conclusions from this table. Firstly, many of these materials are relatively ionic, like MAPbI 3 , making it difficult to achieve smaller band gaps (note again that the band gaps presented here are underestimated, and many will be >2 eV in reality). Secondly, anisotropic crystal structures with stereochemically active lone pairs often lead to higher hole effective masses. Thirdly, most of the materials presented here demonstrate large ionic dielectric constants, independent of whether they have a polar space group. It is clear that MAPbI 3
offers an unusual mix of ionicity, high dielectric constant, low effective masses, and a lower band gap for PV; few semiconductors can claim excellent performance across all categories. Another conclusion consistent with prior observations is that compounds formed with 6 p
block cations show a significantly larger contribution of SO coupling in the conduction band, versus those formed from the 5 p
block. While Pb and Tl compounds are not included here, the Bi compounds show a much stronger SO contribution than do the In, Sn, and Sb compounds. This may suggest that the Bi-containing compounds are most suitable for achieving similarly shallow anion vacancy levels as in MAPbI 3 . To illustrate the similarities in band structure to MAPbI 3 , the band orbital diagrams and DOS are presented in Fig.
4
for a handful of materials. As anticipated, they all demonstrate the same cation antibonding
s -orbital contributions at the VBM.
Figure 4. DOS plotted for three materials identified here, including (a) InI, (b) SbSI, and (c) BiSI. The partial DOS are separated into their atomic orbital contributions, with anions on the positive
y -axis and cations on the negative axis. The cation s states separate into bonding
σ
(lower energy) and antibonding
σ * (higher energy) orbitals. Full size image Summary In this perspective piece, we have proposed new search criteria for the discovery of semiconductors for optoelectronic applications. This strategy builds upon the recent success of methylammonium lead iodide as a PV material, which achieves excellent device efficiencies in the presence of defects. While calculating defect-limited minority-carrier mobility and lifetime is challenging, we propose that more fundamental electronic-structure properties are indicative of defect tolerance, demonstrated by models for defect-assisted recombination and scattering. These models are consistent with emerging experimental and theoretical observations of MAPb X 3 , as well as other semiconductor systems, which share defect tolerance. Most importantly, MAPb X 3
is not unique in these properties, and we identify a broad class ofsemiconductors containing partially oxidized cations, as well as several specific instances that may share these properties. To demonstrate this, we search through the MaterialsProject.org database of materials, and establish a set of criteria for future identification of promising defect-tolerant semiconductors. Many fields would benefit from the development of semiconductors of a wide range of band gaps that can achieve low non-radiative recombination rates and good transport—green LEDs, thin-film PV, and photodetectors, to name a few. We hope that this framework will provide a new direction for materials discovery in these fields, and in doing so, bring understudied semiconductors to the fore to help build the next generation of energy-generating, light-emitting, sensing, and computing devices.
Methods All DFT and related calculations are performed using VASP computer code.[ 91 ] The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional form[ 92 ] of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) to density functional theory has been employed in this work, together with the projector-augmented wave formalism.[ 93 ] Full atomic, volume, and cell shape relaxations are performed at the GGA–PBE level using the numerical setup, including
k -point sampling and various cutoffs, following Ref.
94 . For the various electronic-structure properties reported in Table
I , such as band gaps, SO interaction contributions to band edges, DOS effective masses and band degeneracies; the denser
k -point grid is used. For compatibility between different calculations, the number of
k -points per atom was kept fixed at
N atoms * N kpts
= 6000, which leads to the convergence of relevant electronic-structure properties.[ 55 ] The SO interaction is included at the level of first-order perturbation to the DFT results. Ionic dielectric tensors are computed from the interatomic force constants obtained using the density functional perturbation theory.[ 95 ] The dielectric constants reported in Table
I
are computed as one-third of the trace [Tr( ε )/3] of the dielectric tensors.

GaP tensile strain compensation (SC) layers were introduced into GaAs solar cells enhanced with a five layer stack of InAs quantum dots (QDs). One sun air mass zero illuminated current-voltage curves show that SC results in improved conversion efficiency and reduced dark current. The strain compensated QD solar cell shows a slight increase in short circuit current compared to a baseline GaAs cell due to sub-GaAs bandgap absorption by the InAs QD. Quantum efficiency and electroluminescence were also measured and provide further insight to the improvements due to SC.

It has been predicted that solar cell efficiency can be improved through the incorporation of low dimensional nanostructured materials. 1,2
One approach involves the insertion of quantum dots (QDs) into standard single junction solar cells in an attempt to form an isolated intermediate band (IB) within the bandgap of the host. 3,4
Initial theoretical predictions for conversion efficiency of the IB design are near 63%. 1,5
Recently, there have been numerous experimental demonstrations of the key operating principles of the IB solar cell using both InAs (Refs.
6 and 7 ) and GaSb (Ref.
8 ) QDs in a GaAs host. A complementary approach to the IB design takes advantage of the extended absorption spectrum of the lower bandgap heterostructures (QDs) inserted into the current limiting junction of a multijunction solar cell. 9
In this approach, the extended absorption spectrum of the nanostructures allows for an enhancement of the overall short circuit current and a global efficiency improvement of the triple junction cell. The theoretical modeling of an
In Ga P ∕ Ga As ∕ Ge
triple junction cell, in which QDs are used to extend the middle junction absorption spectrum, indicated that the efficiency could be improved to 47% under 1 sun AM0 illumination. 9
These devices may also have additional benefits such as enhanced radiation tolerance. 10
In this paper, the effect of incorporating InAs QDs and GaP strain compensation (SC) layers within the
i
region of a
p - i - n
GaAs solar cell has been investigated. As the InAs QDs are grown using the Stranski–Kranstanow technique, residual compressive strain will accumulate as successive dot layers are grown. As has been done for QD laser diodes 11,12
and multi-quantum-well (multi-QW) well solar cells, 13
a layer of material under tensile strain (e.g., GaP) can be grown to offset compressive strain, leading to an overall strain neutral QD or QW stack. Prior work was done by inserting the QDs into the
i
region of the GaAs solar cell without SC. 14
These cells did show an increase in the sub-GaAs bandgap spectral response but the added strain from the QDs resulted in cell efficiency degradation. Recent work by Marti
et al. 15
has also shown that strain induced dislocations in the cell emitter originate in the uncompensated quantum dot stacks.
For this study, GaAs-based solar cells containing five-layer InAs QD arrays, both with and without GaP SC layers, were grown using a multiwafer rotating disk metal organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) system. Growth conditions and optical properties of these QDs have been previously reported. 16
The QD size
( height × diameter )
and density were determined to be
7 × 40 nm 2
and
5 ( ± 0.5 ) × 10 10 cm − 2 ⁠ , respectively.
GaAs based
p - i - n
solar cells were grown both with and without InAs QDs embedded in the
i
region and with and without GaP SC layers between each InAs layer. The design of the baseline
p - i - n
solar cell has been discussed elsewhere. 14
The baseline cells without InAs QDs had a
100 nm
GaAs intrinsic region, while cells with QDs had an array of five layers of undoped InAs QDs grown in the
i
region using the optimized QD growth conditions. The thickness of the GaAs spacer between each dot layer was
10 nm ⁠ . For the strain compensated (SC) QD solar cells, each QD layer was followed by the growth of a
6 nm
GaAs spacer and a
1.4 nm
GaP SC layer. An additional
4 nm
GaAs spacer was then grown in preparation for the next QD layer. Figure
1
shows a simplified band diagram generated using physics-based modeling software ( SILVACO ATLAS ). This diagram illustrates the layer structure in the
i
region of the strain compensated QD solar cell.

( J sc ) ⁠ , efficiency, and fill factor (FF) for the three cells in this study. The baseline cell gave results at or near the standard values for GaAs solar cells, confirming the GaAs cell design and material quality from our MOVPE process. 17
The addition of the uncompensated QD array results in a substantial decrease in overall cell performance. Degradation in both
J sc
and
V oc
are likely due to increased minority carrier recombination. The reduced FF results from a decrease in majority carrier mobility in the emitter region. 18
Mobility degradation has been shown to be related to misfit dislocations which may originate at the QD layer and thread to the surface, thereby creating scattering centers within the emitter region. 15

Inclusion of SC layers had a profound effect on the illuminated AM0
J V
characteristics of the QD device (Fig.
2 ). The open circuit voltage improved to
0.83 V
and the short circuit current also improved to the extent that there was a slight increase compared to the baseline device. The increased
J sc
of the device resulted from an improved lifetime in the emitter region 11
and from the photogenerated current contributed by the QDs. The increase in
V oc
can be related to a reduction in recombination current through the dependence of open circuit voltage on both
J sc
and saturation current
( J 0 ) ⁠ . The improvement in FF can be attributed to improved carrier transport through the intrinsic and emitter regions.
Measurements of the diodes under dark conditions allowed for the saturation current and ideality parameters to be extracted (see Table
I ), thereby providing an alternative method for verifying the reduction in recombination current. The baseline cell gave a low
J 0
and diode ideality
( n )
of 1.48. This behavior is typical for GaAs
p - i - n
diodes of this size and indicates that the cell is of good quality but deviates from ideal conditions
( n = 1 )
due to surface and/or perimeter recombination. 19
The uncompensated QD enhanced solar cell shows both an increase in
J 0
and an ideality greater than 2. This is an evidence of the increase in the recombination in the depletion region and nonideal diode behavior due to dislocations in the emitter region. The use of SC results in reduced
J 0
and an ideality much closer to the baseline value. This was a clear indication that SC results in a reduction of the recombination driven current.
Measurements of the cell quantum efficiency (QE) also show the advantage to the inclusion of the SC layers. QE measures the number of electrons or holes collected as photocurrent per incident photon of light at a particular wavelength. As seen in Fig.
3(a) , the QE for a standard GaAs cell will rapidly fall off at the GaAs band edge near
870 nm
(photons with energy below the bandgap produce no photocurrent in the cell). However, the five-layer QD cells show an extended QE spectrum at wavelengths below
870 nm ⁠ . The QD cells show
∼ 2 %
QE in the
870 – 950 nm
range. This indicates that a portion of the short circuit current is being generated from below the host bandgap.

Although both QD cells show enhanced QE below the GaAs bandgap, the effect of adding uncompensated dots to the cell structure reduced the QE above the host bandgap. The QE for the strain compensated QD cell did not show any degradation in the above GaAs bandgap spectral range. The sub-GaAs bandgap QE was also slightly increased over the five-layer uncompensated cell. This further evidenced that the SC layers both improve emitter material quality (above GaAs bandgap QE recovery) and improve the QD quality (increased sub-GaAs bandgap QE).
In addition, the room-temperature electroluminescence (EL) spectra of the SC-QD device [Fig.
3(b) ] was compared to its spectral response. As can be seen in the EL spectra, carrier injection into the
i
region leads to multiple peaks (labeled as 1, 2, and 3 in the figure), each of which corresponds to peaks in the cell QE curve. Based on earlier measurements of PL test structures containing our QDs, peak 3 corresponds to the ground state energy transition. 16
The peaks at 1 and 2 are due either to transitions involving the higher energy bound states in the QDs or transitions within the thin InAs wetting layer QW. 4
The correspondence of EL and QE is further evidence of light absorption and subsequent carrier collection occurring in the InAs superlattice. Similar measurements of the uncompensated QD cell failed to give any detectable EL signal.
Extraction of short circuit current from integration of the spectral response with the standard AM0 spectrum was done for both the baseline and SC-QD enhanced solar cells. The SC-QD cell result gave a small net increase in short circuit current of
∼ 0.1 mA ∕ cm 2
over the baseline cell. Although this increase in
J sc
is modest, the result is highly encouraging. The QD contribution to short circuit current is expected to increase though additional layers of QDs.
In conclusion, we have grown GaAs based
p - i - n
solar cells with and without InAs QDs and with and without a GaP SC scheme. Our results under simulated 1 sun AM0 conditions have demonstrated the effectiveness of SC layers for improving the performance of QD solar cells. A five-layer SC-QD device was grown which had increased
J sc
and QE as compared to a baseline device. Comparisons of EL and spectral response for the SC-QD cell showed a clear sub-GaAs bandgap spectral response and confirmed QD absorption and subsequent carrier collection. The SC-QD cell results show the possibility of using this type of cell to current match the full
In Ga P ∕ Ga As ∕ Ge
triple junction solar cell.

Abstract:
X-ray residual stress analysis is a widespread nondestructive technique to investigate the residual stress and residual stress gradient in thin films and protective coatings.In the present contribution we introduce a new method based on the noncomplanar measurement geometry that allow to span large area of sin 2
ψ and penetration depth values without sample inclination. The refraction correction and absorption is considered in details for the noncomplanar measurements. The proposed technique is applied to determine stress gradients of blasted hard TiN coatings.

Abstract Organolead trihalide perovskite materials have been successfully used as light absorbers in efficient photovoltaic cells. Two different cell structures, based on mesoscopic metal oxides and planar heterojunctions have already demonstrated very impressive advances in performance. Here, we report a bilayer architecture comprising the key features of mesoscopic and planar structures obtained by a fully solution-based process. We used CH 3 NH 3
Pb(I 1  −  x Br x ) 3
( x
= 0.1–0.15) as the absorbing layer and poly(triarylamine) as a hole-transporting material. The use of a mixed solvent of γ-butyrolactone and dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) followed by toluene drop-casting leads to extremely uniform and dense perovskite layers via a CH 3 NH 3 I–PbI 2 –DMSO intermediate phase, and enables the fabrication of remarkably improved solar cells with a certified power-conversion efficiency of 16.2% and no hysteresis. These results provide important progress towards the understanding of the role of solution-processing in the realization of low-cost and highly efficient perovskite solar cells.

Main Today, crystalline silicon dominates the solar panel industry but remains relatively expensive to manufacture. If devices could be fabricated from cheap materials by a simple solution process without annealing at high temperature, their costs could be considerably reduced through mass production. Although dye-sensitized 1 , quantum dot 2 , 3 , organic 4 , 5 , and inorganic–organic heterojunction solar cells 6 , 7
can be fabricated by multiple or single solution processes, the cells still suffer from problems such as a lack of long-term stability and low conversion efficiency due to fundamental energy losses associated with the extensive interface for charge separation. Recently, methylammonium lead halide (MAPbX 3 , where MA is methylammonium CH 3 NH 3
and X is a halogen) perovskites 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16
have offered the promise of a breakthrough for next-generation solar devices. The use of perovskites affords several advantages: excellent optical properties that are tunable by managing chemical compositions 13 ; ambipolar charge transport 10 ; and very long electron–hole diffusion lengths 17 , 18 . Perovskite materials have been applied as light absorbers to thin or thick mesoscopic metal oxides and planar heterojunction solar devices. For example, when MAPbI 3
was loaded on a mesoporous (mp)-TiO 2
electrode by the sequential deposition of PbI 2
and methylammonium iodide (MAI), a 15.0% power-conversion efficiency (PCE) was achieved under 1 sun illumination 11 . The authors of ref.  12
reported a maximum performance of 15.4% efficiency with an open-circuit voltage ( V oc ) of 1.07 V and short-circuit current density ( J sc ) of 21.5 mA cm −2 , based on uniform MAPbI 3 −  x Cl x
planar thin layers deposited by the vacuum thermal evaporation method without the mp-TiO 2
electrode. Several other groups also reported efficient planar solar cells, based on normal organic photovoltaic structure 12 , 19 . Although very impressive cell efficiencies have been achieved, the cell architecture, use of vacuum, or the two-step deposition process should be modified to improve efficiency and reduce fabrication cost. Spin-coating, one of the cheapest film production methods, is widely used in solution-processed perovskite solar cells. Evaporation and the convective self-assembly process during spinning immediately induce the formation of well-crystallized perovskite materials due to strong ionic interactions between the metal cations and halogen anions. Generally, γ-butyrolactone (GBL),
N , N -dimethylformamide, DMSO and
N -methyl-2-pyrrolidone are used as effective solvents for lead halides and MAI. However, simple spin-coating did not yield a homogeneous perovskite layer having uniform thickness over a large area 20 , although the convective spreading flow due to centrifugal force was applied to the slowly evaporating solvents. Previously, we reported the formation of a pillared structure with an island-type upper layer 10 , and proposed the importance of a homogeneous upper layer on the mp-TiO 2
base; however, we were unable to deposit uniform thin films by the solution process. Furthermore, it was reported that the uniformity of the perovskite films depended on the thickness of the TiO 2
compact layer, and modification of the spinning conditions could not achieve 100% surface coverage 20 . This limited the applicability of the solution process. Here, we report the solution-process fabrication of efficient perovskite solar cells comprising a bilayer architecture and MAPb(I 1 −  x Br x ) 3
perovskites formed by a solvent-engineering technology. The MAPb(I 1 −  x Br x ) 3
perovskite composition was used because the substitution of 10–15 mol% Br −
for I −
in MAPbI 3
greatly improved the stability in ambient atmosphere, and the dual halide material demonstrated similar performance over the compositional range 13 . When the perovskite was deposited using a mixture of GBL and DMSO, followed by a toluene drip while spinning, extremely uniform and dense layers were formed. This solvent-engineering technology enabled a fully solution-processed perovskite solar cell with a certified 16.2% power-conversion efficiency under standard reporting conditions. Figure 1
presents a schematic diagram of the cell architecture and deposition of perovskite materials by the solvent-engineering technology by means of spin-coating, as well as X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the resulting coatings. The cell architecture ( Fig. 1a ) reveals a bilayer structure comprising mesoscopic and planar structures, and is effective for sufficiently absorbing light and collecting charges. Atop the mp-TiO 2
layer lies a highly uniform perovskite active layer (100–300 nm thick). Poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) and Au metal were next deposited on the active layer as a hole-transporting material and photocathode, respectively. For this architecture, the formation of a homogeneous thin perovskite layer is extremely important, and we developed our solvent-engineering technology as an effective tool for creating such a layer. The process involves five stages, as depicted in
Fig. 1c . First, a mixture of MAI, MABr, PbI 2 , PbBr 2 , GBL and DMSO in the appropriate ratio is spread over the entire surface of the substrate. Second, the spin-coater is accelerated to the desired rotational speed and maintained there for several tens of seconds to evaporate the solvent. Third, a solvent that does not dissolve the perovskite materials and is miscible with DMSO and GBL (for example, toluene or chloroform) is dripped on the substrate during spinning. Fourth, all constituents are frozen into a uniform layer on the removal of the residual DMSO and then a new complex as an intermediate phase is formed (see below). Finally, the complex is converted into highly uniform and crystalline perovskite on annealing at 100 °C for 10 min ( Fig. 1b ). As is apparent from
Supplementary Fig. 1 , the morphology of the perovskite thin layer is markedly changed by this solvent-engineering process, as compared with model systems on quartz substrate. In pure GBL, the perovskite crystals formed immediately, and the colour of the film on the substrate changed to dark hazy brown during rotation at 5,000 r.p.m, regardless of the application of the toluene drip. The resulting morphology appears as inhomogeneous islands with low coverage on the substrate ( Supplementary Fig. 1a ). In contrast, in the DMSO and GBL mixed solvent, the colour change to dark brown is not observed during spin-coating, even after 5 min rotation. The spin-coated layer formed with the solvent mixture followed by the toluene drip is extremely uniform and transparent, and covers the full surface with low surface roughness. Without the toluene drip treatment, the resulting material adopts a textile-like inhomogeneous layer that does not fully cover the substrate, and perovskite crystals are formed from the coating after annealing at 100 °C ( Supplementary Fig. 1b ). Here, the crystallinity of the perovskite films is almost the same regardless of the toluene drop-casting, as can be seen in values of full-width at half-maximum of (110) XRD peaks of
Supplementary Fig. 2 . Therefore, the solvent-engineering technique is critically important for this process. Figure 1: Device architecture, scheme of solvent engineering process, and XRD of perovskite layer. a , Device architecture of the bilayered perovskite solar cell (glass/FTO/bl-TiO 2 /mp-TiO 2 -perovskite nanocomposite layer/perovskite upper layer/PTAA/Au).
b , XRD pattern of the annealed perovskite coating on fused silica substrate. The inset shows a SEM image of a surface consisting of a glass/FTO/bl-TiO 2 /mp-TiO 2 -perovskite nanocomposite layer/perovskite upper layer.
c , Solvent engineering procedure for preparing the uniform and dense perovskite film. Full size image To gain further insight into the mixed-solvent application and subsequent toluene drip treatment, we isolated the intermediate phase formed by pouring MAI and PbI 2
dissolved in GBL and DMSO into toluene. In this experiment, we excluded the doping of MABr and PbBr 2
to simplify our analysis. The XRD profiles shown in
Fig. 2a
imply that the resultant intermediate phase is self-organized and highly crystalline in nature. Therefore, we think that the phase formed on toluene drop-casting in step 3 of
Fig. 1c
has a well-developed crystalline form. To get further information for the phase, we compared it with the XRD patterns for PbI 2 , MAI and PbI 2 (DMSO) 2 , because the constituents in the mixed solvent can be simply precipitated in the non-dissolving solvent. Here, PbI 2
as a layered semiconductor material contains a plane of Pb ions sandwiched between adjacent layers of hexagonally arranged iodide ions. The interlayer spaces allow rapid intercalation of different guest molecules owing to the weak bonding between the two planes by van der Waals-type interactions, leading to the expansion of the interlayer distance along the
c
axis 21 . It was known that the DMSO used as a solvent in this work can coordinate with lead halide to form a PbI 2 (DMSO) 2
complex 22 . However, as can be seen in the figure, the isolated powder is a new and unreported compound that cannot be assigned to reported materials, and is related to the intermediate phase formed during perovskite deposition from DMSO and GBL. Thus, we considered a MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO complex as a possible crystalline compound that can be formed from the solution mixture. In the DMSO and GBL solution mixture, GBL functions purely as a solvent, which has a relatively higher evaporation rate than DMSO during spinning; XRD patterns of the intermediate phase completely matched the material isolated from DMSO in the absence of GBL. The mass percentage for a given element in MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO (C 3 H 12 NSOPbI 3 ) requires H = 1.7%; C = 5.2%; N = 2.0%; O = 2.3%; S = 4.6%; Pb = 29.7%; and I = 54.5%. Elemental analysis of the intermediate phase yielded the following percentages by weight: H = 1.6%; C = 4.6%; N = 2.0%; O = 2.2%; and S = 3.7%; with a remainder of 85.9%. If the residue is assumed to be Pb and 3I, the weight percentages of Pb and I can be determined as 30% and 55.9%, respectively. As expected, the average atomic mass formula from elemental analysis is in agreement with MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO. In addition, the intercalation of both MAI and DMSO into PbI 2
can be observed by XRD peaks at low angles (6.55°, 7.21° and 9.17°). The appearance of XRD peaks at low angles indicates that the MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO intermediate phase has longer interplanar distances, which are different from those in the DMSO–PbI 2 –DMSO complex, by the substitution of MAI for DMSO. The presence of MAI and DMSO in PbI 2
is further confirmed from the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectrum for the intermediate phase.
Figure 2b
reveals the following spectral features and peak positions for the isolated powder; S–O and C–S stretching vibrations from DMSO coordinated to Pb 2+
at 1,012 cm −1 ; N–H stretching in the range about 3,200–3,450 cm −1 ; and C–H stretching in the range about 2,800–2,950 cm −1 . The FTIR spectra of MAI, PbI 2 , DMSO–PbI 2 –DMSO, MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO and MAPbI 3
are provided in
Supplementary Fig. 3
for functional group comparison. The detection of both the N–H and S–O deformation modes in the intermediate phase guarantees the successful inclusion of a solvent molecule (DMSO) and MAI into the PbI 2 . Furthermore, the C=C mode indicative of the toluene dripping solvent is not detected. Figure 2: XRD and FTIR of the intermediate phase and scheme for the formation of perovskite material via the intermediate phase. a , XRD spectra of PbI 2
(haematite, JCPDS file No. 07-0235), MAI, PbI 2 (DMSO) 2
and MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO intermediate phase powders. Comparing the XRD patterns of these powders, it is seen that the intermediate phase is different from the PbI 2 , MAI and PbI 2 (DMSO) 2
phases.

d , Scheme for the formation of the perovskite material via the MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO intermediate phase. (i) PbI 2
consisting of edge-sharing [PbI 6 ] 4− -octahedral layers. (ii) MAI and DMSO guest molecules intercalated between the layers, forming the flat MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO intermediate phase film, when toluene is introduced onto the wet film comprising PbI 2 , MAI and DMSO. Here, the positions of the guest molecules are unconfirmed. (iii) Finally, the intermediate phase film is converted to the perovskite phase with corner-sharing octahedra via the extraction of DMSO guest molecules by the annealing process. The perovskite film is extremely uniform and flat because of the solid-state conversion from the uniform and flat intermediate phase film. Full size image The conversion of the intermediate phase into perovskite with annealing temperature was monitored by
in situ
high-temperature XRD. The low-angle diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern of
Fig. 2c
clearly show that, with increasing temperature, the putative MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO disappears and new peaks are observed due to the appearance of MAPbI 3
perovskite. We see that the formation of the perovskite phase is accompanied by the complete transformation of the MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO at 130 °C, whereas both MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO and perovskite phases coexist at 100 °C. On the basis of the above observations, we propose a plausible mechanism for the formation of the uniform and dense perovskite layer during spin-coating from MAI, PbI 2
and DMSO with a toluene drip treatment. As shown in
Fig. 2d , at the initial stage during spinning, the film is composed of MAI and PbI 2
dissolved in the DMSO/GBL solvent mixture, whereas in the intermediate stage, the composition of the film is concentrated by the evaporation of GBL. Then the toluene droplets lead to the immediate freezing of the constituents on spinning via the quick removal of the excess DMSO solvent and the rapid formation of the MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO phase, leaving a uniform and transparent thin layer ( Supplementary Fig. 1d ). The role of DMSO in the MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO phase is to retard the rapid reaction between PbI 2
and MAI during the evaporation of solvent in the spin-coating process. Finally, the extremely homogeneous flat film (shown in
Fig. 3a ) is converted into a pure crystalline MAPbI 3
perovskite layer after annealing at 100 °C. In this process, the key material is the flat film consisting of MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO. These behaviours do not change by using the mixed-halide materials, MAPb(I 1 −  x Br x ) 3
( x
= 0.1–0.15).

d , Cross-sectional SEM image of a complete perovskite device. Full size image Accordingly, the formation of the intermediate phase is a critical factor for smoothing the surface via dropwise toluene application, which finally results in compact and uniform thin layers.
Figure 3
illustrates images obtained by atomic force microscopy (AFM) for the intermediate film and the perovskite film on fused silica substrate, and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the surface of the perovskite upper layer and the cross-section of a representative cell formed by our solvent-engineering technology. As can be seen in the three-dimensional AFM images and topography of
Fig. 3a,b , the root mean square roughness values for the intermediate phase and crystalline perovskite layer are 6.0 and 8.3 nm, respectively, even though the formation of the perovskite from the intermediate layer gave slightly increased roughness. In
Fig. 3c , we can observe that the surface exhibits a dense-grained uniform morphology with grain sizes in the range 100–500 nm. The entire film is composed of a homogeneous, well-crystallized perovskite layer. In addition, from a typical cross-sectional SEM image of a real device, we can see two uniform layers consisting of a TiO 2 /perovskite nanocomposite and the pure perovskite ( Fig. 3d ); the perovskite materials are fully infiltrated into the pores of the mp-TiO 2
film, and also deposited in a very uniform thick film with 100% surface coverage atop the mp-TiO 2 , compared with the conventional method 10 , 11 . To fabricate efficient solar cells, the active layer of the light harvester must be thick enough to absorb sufficient incident light. Fortunately, the high absorption coefficient ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ) of a perovskite light absorber film allows the use of very thin layers ( ∼ 330 nm thick) to absorb the entire range of visible light. Indeed, the authors of ref.
12
fabricated a highly efficient thin solar cell exceeding 15% efficiency with a perovskite absorber (MAPbI 1 −  x Cl x ) of
∼ 300 nm without mp-TiO 2 , and reported that the MAPbI 1 −  x Cl x
perovskite had a long diffusion length (> 1 μm; ref.  17 ). These results encouraged us to fabricate a thin-film solar cell using MAPb(I 1 −  x Br x ) 3
( x  = 0.1–0.15) with a thickness of 350 nm in the absence of mp-TiO 2 . We were able to fabricate thin-film solar cells with extremely uniform, dense layers ( Fig. 3a–c ) by our solvent-engineering technology.
Figure 4a
presents the
I – V
curves for a cell fabricated without the mp-TiO 2
layer, measured with a 40 ms scanning delay in reverse (from the open-circuit voltage ( V oc ) to the short-circuit current ( I sc )) and forward (that is, from
I sc
to
V oc ) modes under standard air-mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5 G) illumination.
Table 1
summarizes the extracted short-circuit current density ( J sc ),
V oc
and fill factor (FF). Apparently, there is a large hysteresis and distortion in the
I – V
curves. The
J sc ,
V oc
and FF values obtained from the
I – V
curve of the reverse scan were 19.2 mA cm −2 , 1.09 V and 0.69, respectively, yielding a PCE of 14.4% under standard AM 1.5 conditions. In contrast, the corresponding values from the
I – V
curve of the forward scan were 19.2 mA cm −2 , 1.07 V and 0.44, respectively, showing a pronounced discrepancy of 9.1% in overall efficiency. Such hysteresis and the discrepancy result in the underestimation of the real
J – V
curves in the forward scan and overestimation in the reverse scan. Typically, reliable solar cell
I–V
measurements should exhibit coincident curves for both the forward and reverse scans. In some cases, depending on the cells, the measurements must be carried out with longer scanning delays. Thus, the efficiencies for the cell without the mp-TiO 2
layer were compared between the forward and reverse scans at various delay times ranging from 10 to 300 ms. As can be seen in
Supplementary Fig. 5a
the efficiency decreased from 11.0 to 7.0% in the forward scan and from 16.5 to 8.5% in the reverse scan, as the delay time increased from 10 to 300 ms. The efficiencies did not approach similar values even when the scan time was long. Furthermore, the average efficiency from the reverse and forward scans continued to decline with increasing delay time. Thus, the large discrepancy and discordance with scan direction and delay time can induce a considerable error in evaluating cell efficiency. In contrast, the
J – V
curves of the forward and reverse scans of the cell with the bilayer architecture {FTO/blocking layer (bl)-TiO 2 /mp-TiO 2
( ∼ 200 nm)/upper layer ( ∼ 200 nm)/PTAA (50 nm)/Au} ( Fig. 4b ) were well coincident. Moreover, the efficiency and average efficiency from both scan directions were symmetrical and identical regardless of the scanning direction, and results using a significantly shorter delay time were coincident with those from a cell lacking the mp-TiO 2
( Supplementary Fig. 5b ). The
J sc ,
V oc
and FF values obtained from the
I – V
curves of
Fig. 4b
for the reverse and forward scans are summarized in
Table 1 , and the overall efficiencies for both scan directions under the standard method are 15.8 and 15.9% with an average of 15.85%, clearly showing the reliability of the
I–V
measurements. Generally, the average value of the efficiency, determined from the forward and reverse scans should be widely accepted when the scanning delay time is longer than 40 ms (ref.  23 ), because an excessively long time to complete the measurement is impractical. Figure 4: Photovoltaic performance as a function of scan direction and mp-TiO 2
layer thickness. a ,

curves for a flat cell (FTO/bl-TiO 2 /350-nm-thick perovskite layer/PTAA/Au) measured by forward (short circuit → open circuit) and reverse (open circuit → short circuit) scans with 10 mV voltage steps and 40 ms delay times under AM 1.5 G illumination.

c , Relationship between the power-conversion efficiency of the perovskite cells versus the thickness of the mp-TiO 2
layer. For each thickness, 12 cells were characterized. The error bars represent maximum and minimum efficiency values (vertical) and thickness values (horizontal; thickness calculated from SEM cross-sections). Full size image Table 1 Photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells without mp-TiO 2
or with 200-nm-thick mp-TiO 2 . Full size table For a deeper understanding of the dependence of the
I – V
parameters on both scan directions, we investigated the difference between the forward and reverse scans for a 40 ms scan time as a function of the thickness of the mp-TiO 2
layer. As the layer thickness increased to ~200 nm, the difference in efficiency between the forward and reverse scans reached a minimum, and then again deviated slightly with continuing mp-TiO 2
thickness increases ( Fig. 4c ). Interestingly, the efficiency measured in the reverse scan did not vary greatly with the mp-TiO 2
thickness, whereas the forward scan yielded a pronounced variation, resulting in a large discrepancy between the two scan directions. Such a strong dependence of the measured efficiency on the scan direction with mp-TiO 2
thickness suggests that solar cells fabricated from MAPbX 3
perovskite materials operate differently than other types of cells such as organic, dye-sensitized, and conventional Si solar cells. The stepwise increase or decrease in the bias voltage, corresponding to a reverse or forward scan, respectively, requires a charge redistribution to reach a new equilibrium state. These characteristics of perovskite solar cells may be related to the large diffusion capacitance of such cells operating under reverse or forward biases 24 . The large capacitance is assumed to be related to the underestimation in the forward scan and overestimation in the reverse scan by charging and discharging during the voltage sweep in the solar cells. In other words, the generated charge (electrons or holes) may persist in the perovskite owing to the slow charge collection in the thick perovskite layer, and require significant time for charge distribution. This would impede a quick response to the rapid scanning of the applied voltage for the
I – V
measurements. Therefore, the slow charge collection via the perovskite material itself must be improved to eliminate the large discrepancy with scan direction, and an optimally thick mp-TiO 2
layer must be introduced for efficient charge collection from the perovskite via the large TiO 2
interface. Eventually, it will be very important to impart effective charge collection and light absorption properties through a balance in the ratios between the perovskite-infiltrated TiO 2
layer and the thin upper layers. Of course, the tendency for discrepancy according to scan direction can be related to the perovskite composition, because the exciton diffusion length was markedly changed by doping Cl ions into MAPbI 3
(ref.  17 ). To further enhance the performance of our cells fabricated by solvent engineering, we repeated the fabrication procedure using mp-TiO 2
with a thickness of
∼ 200 nm. The
J – V
curves and incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectrum of the best performing solar cell are presented in
Fig. 5 . The average values from the
J – V
curves from the reverse and forward scans ( Fig. 5a ) exhibited a
J sc
of 19.58 mA cm −2 ,
V oc
of 1.105 V, and FF of 76.2%, corresponding to a PCE of 16.5% under standard AM 1.5 G conditions. The best device also showed a very broad IPCE plateau of over 80% between 420 and 700 nm, as shown in
Fig. 5b . The
J sc
value integrated from the IPCE agreed well with that measured by
I – V . In
Fig. 5c
a histogram of the average PCEs for all of the independently fabricated cells contributing to our study is presented. Around 80% of the cells made using our process exhibited an overall efficiency exceeding of 15% under 1 sun conditions, proving the conceptual validity of a balanced thickness between the TiO 2
and thin upper layers. In addition, an evaluation of the available results allows us to conclude that this solvent-engineering approach provides a simple and effective means for realizing high-efficiency and low-cost perovskite-based solar cells. One of these devices was certified by the standardized method in a photovoltaics calibration laboratory, confirming a PCE of 16.2% under AM 1.5 G full sun ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ). Figure 5:

curves are summarized (inset).

c , Histogram of average efficiencies for 108 devices. Full size image In summary, we developed a solvent-engineering technology for the deposition of extremely uniform perovskite layers, and demonstrated a solution-processed perovskite solar cell with 16.5% PCE under standard conditions (AM 1.5 G radiation, 100 mW cm −2 ). We proposed a plausible mechanism for the formation of uniform and dense perovskite layers during the solvent-engineering process. The formation of a stable MAI(Br)–PbI 2 –DMSO phase via an intercalation process during the dropwise application of a non-dissolving solvent was a decisive factor in retarding the rapid reaction between MAI(Br) and PbI(Br) 2 , which enabled the formation of a highly uniform and dense surface. Furthermore, we found that thick perovskite cells fabricated without mp-TiO 2
showed a large hysteresis and distortion between reverse and forward scans, and raised arguments about the estimation of conversion efficiencies for perovskite cells. Hence, the ratio of the thicknesses of the perovskite-infiltrated mp-TiO 2
and the pure perovskite should be optimized to fabricate efficient perovskite cells with coincident reverse and forward scans. These results will provide an effective strategy for forming uniform PbI 2 -based perovskite layers through intercalation, and lead to more efficient and cost-effective inorganic–organic hybrid heterojunction solar cells in the future. Methods Solar cell fabrication. A dense blocking layer of TiO 2
(bl-TiO 2 ,
∼ 70 nm in thickness) was deposited onto a F-doped SnO 2
(FTO, Pilkington, TEC8) substrate by spray pyrolysis, using a 20 mM titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution (Aldrich) at 450 °C to prevent direct contact between the FTO and the hole-conducting layer. A 200–300-nm-thick mesoporous TiO 2
(particle size: about 50 nm, crystalline phase: anatase) film was spin-coated onto the bl-TiO 2 /FTO substrate using home-made pastes 14
and calcining at 500 °C for 1 h in air to remove organic components. CH 3 NH 3 I (MAI) and CH 3 NH 3 Br (MABr) were first synthesized by reacting 27.86 ml CH 3 NH 2
(40% in methanol, Junsei Chemical) and 30 ml HI (57 wt% in water, Aldrich) or 44 ml HBr (48 wt% in water, Aldrich) in a 250 ml round-bottom flask at 0 °C for 4 h with stirring, respectively. The precipitate was recovered by evaporation at 55 °C for 1 h. MAI and MABr were dissolved in ethanol, recrystallized from diethyl ether, and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h. The prepared MAI and MABr powders, PbI 2
(Aldrich) and PbBr 2
(Aldrich) for 0.8 M MAPb(I 1 −  x Br x ) 3
( x
= 0.1–0.15) solution were stirred in a mixture of GBL and DMSO (7:3 v/v) at 60 °C for 12 h. The resulting solution was coated onto the mp-TiO 2 /bl-TiO 2 /FTO substrate by a consecutive two-step spin-coating process at 1,000 and 5,000 r.p.m for 10 and 20 s, respectively. During the second spin-coating step, the substrate (around 1 cm × 1 cm) was treated with toluene drop-casting. A detailed time-rotation profile for the spin-coating is represented in
Supplementary Fig. 1c . The substrate was dried on a hot plate at 100 °C for 10 min. A solution of poly(triarylamine) (15 mg, PTAA, EM Index,
M w
= 17,500 g mol −1 ) in toluene (1.5 ml) was mixed with 15 μl of a solution of lithium bistrifluoromethanesulphonimidate (170 mg) in acetonitrile (1 ml) and 7.5 μl 4- tert -butylpyridine and spin-coated on the MAPb(I 1 −  x Br x ) 3
( x
= 0.1–0.15)/mp-TiO 2 /bl-TiO 2 /FTO substrate at 3,000 r.p.m for 30 s. Finally, a Au counterelectrode was deposited by thermal evaporation. The active area of this electrode was fixed at 0.16 cm 2 . Characterization. The XRD spectra of the prepared films were measured using a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer, and
in situ
XRD experiments of the powder isolated as an intermediate phase were performed using a Rigaku Ultima IV with an X-ray tube (Cu Kα,
λ
= 1.5406 Å). The elemental analysis (C, H, N and S) of the complex was performed using a FISONS EA–1108 CHN analyser. The FTIR spectra (4,000–500 cm −1 ) were recorded on a Bruker EQUINOX 55 spectrophotometer with samples prepared by the KBr pellet method. Ultraviolet–visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV 2550 spectrophotometer in the 200–800 nm wavelength range at room temperature. AFM was performed using Bruker multimode 8 in ‘tapping’ mode. The IPCE was measured using a power source (Newport 300 W xenon lamp, 66920) with a monochromator (Newport Cornerstone 260) and a multimeter (Keithley 2001).
J – V
curves were measured using a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Class A, 91195A) with a source meter (Keithley 2420) at 100 mW cm −2 , AM 1.5 G illumination, and a calibrated Si-reference cell certified by the NREL. The
J – V
curves were measured by reverse (forward bias (1.2 V) → short circuit (0 V)) or forward (short circuit (0 V) → forward bias (1.2 V)) scan. The step voltage was fixed at 10 mV and the delay time, which is a set delay at each voltage step before measuring each current, was modulated.
J – V
curves for all devices were measured by masking the active area with a metal mask 0.094 cm −2
in area.

Abstract Photovoltaic devices based on hybrid perovskite materials have exceeded 22% efficiency due to high charge-carrier mobilities and lifetimes. Properties such as photocurrent generation and open-circuit voltage are influenced by the microscopic structure and orientation of the perovskite crystals, but are difficult to quantify on the intra-grain length scale and are often treated as homogeneous within the active layer. Here, we map the local short-circuit photocurrent, open-circuit photovoltage, and dark drift current in state-of-the-art methylammonium lead iodide solar cells using photoconductive atomic force microscopy. We find, within individual grains, spatially correlated heterogeneity in short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage up to 0.6 V. These variations are related to different crystal facets and have a direct impact on the macroscopic power conversion efficiency. We attribute this heterogeneity to a facet-dependent density of trap states. These results imply that controlling crystal grain and facet orientation will enable a systematic optimization of polycrystalline and single-crystal devices for photovoltaic and lighting applications.

Hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskites are a fascinating and highly promising class of materials for optoelectronic applications, since they are straightforward to fabricate 1 , 2 , 3
and have tunable direct bandgaps 4 , 5 , 6 . After only a few years of active research, polycrystalline thin-film perovskite photovoltaic (PV) devices 7 , 8 , 9
have reached power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 22% (ref.  10 ) and have potential applications as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) 8 , 11 , laser gain media 12 , and photodetectors 13 . For PV devices, the rapid increase in PCE is astounding, considering that the origins of the highly efficient photovoltaic effect, as well as efficiency loss mechanisms, are not fully understood. Systematic optimization of efficiency requires understanding these fundamental processes at their native length scales. Previous work on the macroscopic optoelectronic mechanisms revealed high charge-carrier mobilities 14 , 15 , 16
and long lifetimes 17 , suggesting homogeneous performance within the active layer 18 . At the nanoscale, studies of charge separation processes concluded that devices are analogous to p–i–n junctions 19 , 20 , and another study reported enhanced photocurrent along grain boundaries 21 . Recent studies found surprisingly strong inter-grain photoluminescence (PL) 22
and cathodoluminescence 23
heterogeneity, which suggests that optoelectronic properties, such as open-circuit voltage ( V OC ), may also exhibit strong local variations 24 . These results highlight the pressing need to study local PV characteristics, such as
V OC
and short-circuit current ( I SC ), to understand the factors affecting efficiency in these systems. However, while inorganic and polymer PV materials have been studied on the nanoscale using scanning probe techniques 25 , 26 , 27 , no studies have yet determined the governing optoelectronic properties for perovskite PV devices at their native length scales (10–100 nm) or what limits their efficiency. Here, we locally probe and map the parameters that determine PV device performance— V OC ,
I SC , and dark drift current ( I D )—close to their native length scales. This was accomplished by employing a customized conductive atomic force microscopy (cAFM) technique to provide insight into these critical PV performance-determining parameters with nm-scale resolution. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations on perovskite electronic structure were carried out to support the interpretation of experimental data. We find significant intra-grain heterogeneities, which arise from facet-dependent variations of surface defect states that strongly impact device-level PCE. As a result, the macroscopic PV and LED performance of lead halide perovskites could be optimized by controlling the crystal orientation and facets at interfaces for both polycrystalline and single-crystal devices 16 . Photocurrent microscopy to probe local efficiency We used two sets of methylammonium lead iodide chloride (MAPbI 3− x Cl x ) thin films, which were processed in parallel. One set was used to fabricate planar solar cells by depositing a hole transport layer (HTL, spiro-OMeTAD) and a gold top contact, resulting in an average PCE of 15.7% ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). The second set was used as a half-cell for scanning probe analysis, omitting the HTL and top electrode to directly access the bare MAPbI 3− x Cl x
surface. The large surface roughness of the perovskite material, together with strong tip–sample interactions, pose significant challenges for reproducible cAFM using contact mode scanning ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Hence, we employed a modified cAFM technique in which, at each pixel, the tip approaches the surface, measures the photocurrent, retracts from the surface and moves to the next pixel, as shown in
Fig. 1a . In contrast to conventional cAFM, this technique eliminates friction, which reduces tip–sample deterioration and material transfer, and maintains a constant contact area while measuring current.
Figure 1b
shows a representative topography measurement of the MAPbI 3− x Cl x
surface; the average surface roughness is 19.1 nm and grain size is 142 ± 38 nm. Figure 1: cAFM experiment on the surface of a MAPbI 3− x Cl x
solar cell. a , The entire sample surface is illuminated while a conductive AFM tip measures the photocurrent. Bias is applied to the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrode and current is collected through the platinum-coated AFM tip at virtual ground. The arrows describe the approach–retract scan mode in which the tip approaches, measures, and retracts at each pixel, thereby minimizing potentially damaging tip–sample interactions.
b , A representative topography image of a MAPbI 3− x Cl x
thin film illustrates the large surface roughness. The scale bar is 1 μm. Full size image I SC ,
V OC
and
I D
were measured in this order on MAPbI 3− x Cl x
solar cells under appropriate illumination and bias conditions:
I SC
under illumination at 0 V;
V OC
relative to a reference bias under illumination at forward reference biases between 0.1 and 0.7 V; and
I D
in the dark at 2 and 3 V forward bias. The
V OC
is segmented relative to an applied reference bias. That is, when the photocurrent measured by cAFM is negative, positive, or approximately zero, the
V OC
is less than, greater than, or approximately equal to the applied reference bias. This method of characterizing
V OC
was chosen because alternative techniques, such as collecting local current–voltage curves or scanning potentiometry maps, do not provide reproducible results on hybrid halide perovskites (see
Supplementary Note 1 ). It is important to note that the conditions used to map
I SC
and
V OC
mitigate ion migration 28
because the tip is in contact with the sample for less than 2 ms, while electrical current from analogous macroscale devices is stable for at least hundreds of seconds (see
Supplementary Note 2
and
Supplementary Figs 4 and 5 ). Furthermore, we note that the maximum internal electric field is actually given by the built-in field at zero bias and is reduced as the tip bias approaches
V OC . The topography image in
Fig. 2a
displays individual crystal grains and various crystal facets within these grains. The range of different grain shapes observed in the topography image is due to the lack of preferential grain orientation in these MAPbI 3− x Cl x
films, as we have shown in a previous study using X-ray diffraction 3 . These measurements are reproducible ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ) and free of artefacts from topography and tip–sample interactions, as we illustrate in detail in
Supplementary Note 3 . Figure 2: Intra-grain heterogeneity of
I SC ,
V OC , and efficiency indicator. a , Topography image corresponding to all current maps. Individual crystal grains and their facets are clearly visible. The scale bar is 500 nm.

maps were measured on samples that included a thin HTL layer of spiro-OMeTAD on the MAPbI 3− x Cl x
( Supplementary Fig. 10 ).

close to the reference bias, white areas above and black areas below.
d , To compare heterogeneity of
I SC
and  V OC
to facets, areas in blue (high
V OC
and  I SC ) and areas in red (low
V OC
and  I SC ) are overlaid on the local topography, indicating that many grains have a specific crystal facet that provides higher performance. For enlarged images with marked grains see
Supplementary Fig. 19 . Full size image Surprisingly,
I SC
and
V OC
( Fig. 2b,c ) show not only strong local inter-grain but also intra-grain heterogeneity, which appear to be associated with the facets of individual grains. The photocurrent varies by up to an order of magnitude within individual grains ( I SC
map
Fig. 2b ). Importantly, we find that the average
I SC
for individual grains does not depend on grain size ( Supplementary Fig. 7 ). This result contrasts with that of Nie
et al. 29
and suggests that grain-size-dependent
I SC
may be different for the regime studied here, in which the grain size is smaller than the
∼ 1 μm carrier diffusion length 14 . To ensure that the measured heterogeneity is not due to tip–sample interaction artefacts, we verified that
I SC
was not correlated with crystal height, different regions of constant topographic slope, or lateral and adhesion forces ( Supplementary Fig. 8 ). The
V OC
map shown in
Fig. 2c
also reveals intra-grain heterogeneity. This segmented map was obtained by measuring current at a forward reference bias of 0.6 V, which is near the macroscale
V OC
(0.51 V) obtained on a device with a Pt top contact in place of the HTL/Au to mimic the Pt cAFM tip–sample contact. As a result, all
V OC
values in the map are reported relative to the applied 0.6 V reference bias, as described above. As in the case of
I SC , the observed variation of
V OC
is most pronounced within individual grains, rather than between different grains. As a metric for local PV performance, we define the efficiency indicator, which is assigned as ‘high’ in regions having a combination of high
V OC
and
I SC
and ‘low’ in regions of low
V OC
and
I SC . Note that, contrary to PCE, this efficiency indicator does not contain the fill factor. We could not make quantitative PCE maps, since this would require current–voltage curves at each pixel, for the experimental reasons described above. The efficiency indicator map in
Fig. 2d
was generated by overlaying topography, in grey scale, with pixels representing high efficiency in blue ( V OC
> 0.6 V and
I SC
> 12 pA) and low efficiency in red ( V OC
≤ 0.6 V and
I SC
< 5 pA). Considerable intra-grain heterogeneity can be seen. To exclude tip–substrate effects as a cause for the heterogeneity, we repeated
I SC
and
V OC
scans over the same region and observed no change in the heterogeneity; used tips of different materials and observed similar heterogeneity ( Supplementary Fig. 9 ); and performed cAFM experiments on samples following deposition of a thin HTL layer of spiro-OMeTAD on the MAPbI 3− x Cl x
( Supplementary Fig. 10 ) and observed again similar heterogeneity in
I SC . These tests clearly indicate that the observed spatial variation is an inherent feature of these PV devices and not an artefact of interactions between the tip and the sample material. Grain facet-dependent heterogeneity
The observed intra-grain heterogeneity in
I SC ,
V OC
and efficiency indicator maps appear to be facet dependent when compared to the topography map. To test this observation statistically, the variance of
I SC
within facets was determined and compared to the
I SC
variance of facet-sized areas that were randomly placed over the
I SC
map. The facets were identified by calculating the azimuthal gradient from the measured topography image ( Fig. 3a ), as shown in
Fig. 3b . From the gradient image, the facets were individually identified on the basis of their constant gradient using segmentation and watershed algorithms ( Supplementary Fig. 11 ). The variance of
I SC
values within each facet was calculated, and then averaged, yielding a mean of variances of 5.69 pA 2 . Details of the variance calculation are available in the
Supplementary Methods . To determine the significance of this mean value, the same calculation was performed on randomly selected areas of the
I SC
map that mimic the number and size of the identified facets. This process of randomly selecting areas was completed 2,000 times to generate the histogram of the mean of current variances shown in
Fig. 3c , with the majority of randomly placed areas exhibiting a mean variance of 7.5 pA 2 . Since the current within the crystal facets has a mean variance significantly lower than the range of mean variance for randomly selected areas, the correlation of
I SC
heterogeneity with the crystal facets is statistically confirmed ( p -value = 0.02). The same calculation was performed on another set of topography and
I SC
images for MAPbI 3− x Cl x , and again the mean current variance for the facets was significantly less than for randomly selected areas ( Supplementary Fig. 12 ). From this analysis, we conclude that the intra-grain variations in
I SC
and
V OC
are indeed facet dependent. Figure 3: Facet-dependent

heterogeneity. a , Topography image in same area as
Fig. 2a . Grains are easily distinguished, but facets are more difficult to identify. Scale bar is 1 μm.
b , Azimuthal gradient image calculated from the topography image. Facets (areas of constant slope) are clearly identified in the gradient image.
c , Histogram of the mean of the
I SC
variances calculated for 2,000 sets of randomly placed squares that mimic the size and number of the identified facets in the gradient image. The red dashed line at 5.96 pA 2
is the mean of the
I SC
variances within the identified facets. Based on the histogram, it is statistically unlikely that the mean of the current variances in the facets is random; the
p -value is 0.02. See
Supplementary Methods
for details of gradient identification and mean variance calculation. Full size image While the
I SC
heterogeneity on the length scale probed here might be partially compensated by long charge-carrier diffusion lengths,
V OC
inhomogeneity is the performance-determining factor for macroscale solar cells: MAPbI 3− x Cl x
grains can be approximated as individual PV elements wired in parallel, where the lowest
V OC
will significantly reduce the macroscopic
V OC
(refs  19 , 30 ). If simply considering two adjacent grains, charges will flow from the high- to the low- V OC
grain, reducing the overall
V OC . Hence, we investigated
V OC
variation in more detail by collecting consecutive photocurrent maps of the same area at forward reference biases from 0.1 to 0.7 V, with increments of 0.1 V, shown in
Fig. 4a . These images were aligned, and the voltage values assigned based on two factors: if the photocurrent is approximately zero,
V OC
is set equal to the applied reference bias. If the current switches from positive ( V OC
higher than applied bias) to negative ( V OC
lower than applied bias) from one map to the next,
V OC
is between the two bias values. Values of
V OC
above 0.7 V are marked in white. Some areas are likely to have a higher
V OC
than 0.7 V, but we were not able to measure consecutive photocurrent maps for an applied bias range greater than 0.1 V to 0.7 V without tip modification. Any tip modification can change the tip–substrate contact area and tip work function, making quantitative current and voltage comparisons unreliable. We find a surprisingly large local variation in
V OC —over a range of 0.6 V—that has a dramatic impact on the macroscopic
V OC
and, hence, PCE. Again, the variation in
V OC
is correlated with the crystal facet that is being measured ( Supplementary Fig. 13 ). Figure 4: Heterogeneity in
V OC
and its correlation to

V OC
and
I SC
indicated in
Fig. 2
becomes more apparent when the full
V OC
range map in
Fig. 4a
is compared to the
I SC
map for that area ( Supplementary Fig. 13 ), as illustrated in
Fig. 4b . Higher
V OC
correlates with higher
I SC . Approximately 5% of the measured area was non-functioning with zero
I SC
and
V OC , while 35% of the area produced
V OC
greater than 0.7 V, suggesting that the efficiency in those areas is very high. If one were to assume a uniform fill factor, and gauge PCE only by the product of
V OC
and
I SC , high efficiency facets would perform up to 50% better than average, which would mean that some grains with specific facets could approach the theoretical PCE limit. So far, we have not been able to specifically index the high- and low-efficiency facets: electron backscatter diffraction mapping gave no meaningful results on facet orientation due to damage from the electron beam. Furthermore, spatially resolved elemental analysis by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and by scanning Auger microscopy ( Supplementary Fig. 14 ) failed to find differences in chemical composition, with no detectable trace of chlorine across the surface, consistent with prior reports 31 , 32 , 33 . We considered a range of hypotheses to explain the observed heterogeneity, but most could not describe the experimentally observed facet dependence (see
Supplementary Discussion ). However, we note that recent findings from deQuilettes
et al. 22
showed that inter-grain variation of PL intensity and lifetime are due to variations in trap state concentrations and that the traps can be passivated by surface treatment. Because PL efficiency is related to
V OC
(ref.  24 ), we hypothesize that our observed intra-grain heterogeneity in
V OC
is a consequence of variations in trap state concentrations among crystal facets: a high density of trap states lowers
V OC
due to Fermi level pinning and reduces
I SC
due to higher recombination rates. This hypothesis is further supported by Noel
et al. 34
showing that surface passivation enhances
I SC ,
V OC , and fill factor in PV devices equivalent in material and performance to those studied here. The simultaneous negative effect of trap states on
V OC
and
I SC
explains the strong spatial correlation we observe. Facet impact on internal electric fields and drift current To confirm that the observed heterogeneity in
V OC
and
I SC
is not related to differences in mobility, we mapped the local drift current ( I D ), which is proportional to mobility. We also note that
I D
is an important parameter for LED applications. The
I D
maps at 2 V and 3 V applied bias in
Fig. 5a,b
show that there is greater heterogeneity at 3 V compared to 2 V. An applied bias above 2 V provides sufficiently large electric fields across the perovskite film to ensure that current is dominated by electronic transport ( Supplementary Fig. 15 ) rather than recombination at trap states 19 , 35 , 36 . The
I D
map at 2 V shows very little heterogeneity throughout individual grains and between grains, which indicates a relatively constant mobility at these length scales and bias conditions. This observation indicates that variations of mobility are not the cause of the
I SC
and
V OC
heterogeneity. However, at 3 V forward bias the heterogeneities become much more pronounced and reveal a reoccurrence of facet-dependent heterogeneity ( Fig. 5b ). To ensure reproducibility, we measured at 2 V, 3 V, and back to 2 V, showing no difference in the 2 V
I D
maps or topography ( Supplementary Fig. 16 ). Figure 5: Heterogeneity in drift current due to changes in effective mass. a , Dark drift current ( I D ) map measured at a forward bias of 2 V indicates homogeneous electrical transport within grains. The scale bar is 500 nm.

c , Histogram of the relative drift currents at each pixel within a representative grain measured at 2 and 3 V, showing increased heterogeneity at 3 V.
d , Application of sufficiently high electric fields results in alignment of the MA molecules along the electric field direction and a displacement of the Pb cations relative to I 6
octahedra. Grey, green, black, light blue, and white spheres represent Pb, I, C, N, and H atoms, respectively. The MA molecules are aligned in parallel at an alignment angle of α = 180 ∘ . Enlarged images of these effects in
Supplementary Fig. 20 .
e , The electron and hole effective masses increase as both the Pb ions are displaced and as the MA become more aligned with the electric field. The effective mass can increase by up to a factor of 1.8, depending on the electric field direction. Full size image The enhancement of
I D
heterogeneity when moving from 2 to 3 V forward bias is illustrated in a histogram where the number of pixels is plotted versus the relative drift currents for an individual grain ( Fig. 5c ). The blue histogram represents
I D
at 3 V, the red histogram at 2 V. Due to the difference in
I D
magnitude measured at 2 and 3 V, the current values in the histograms are shifted and normalized to the respective mean currents and the histogram amplitudes are normalized to unity for easy comparison. The
I D
histogram at 3 V (blue) is very broad, with
I D
values ranging over an order of magnitude for different pixels. It shows two distinct peaks at −0.22 and −0.15 nA, which stem from two different facets within one grain, with one facet allowing 1.5 times higher
I D . In contrast, the 2 V histogram (red) is narrow and has only one peak at −65 pA, representing the spatial homogeneity of the measured mobility. Previously, ion migration was observed at comparable applied electric fields, which was indicated by modification of the topography 37 . However, due to our measurement technique, the sample is exposed to the maximum electric field for only 1.6 ms—too brief for ion migration 28 —when the tip is on the sample surface. The field is one order of magnitude lower during the next 10 ms, when the tip retracts, moves to the next pixel, and re-approaches. Based on the Einstein relation, which describes ion motion under an external force, and a diffusion coefficient of 10 −12  cm 2  s −1
(ref.  38 ), iodine ions will drift only 0.062 nm under a bias of 3 V across a 300 nm film over 1.6 ms. Hence, we would not expect topographic or
I D
modification for biases up to 3 V, consistent with our observations. We did not apply a bias over 3 V due to modifications in sample morphology at higher bias. While the
I D
homogeneity at 2 V supports the hypothesis that facet-dependent surface defect state concentrations give rise to local PV performance differences, the question remains: what causes the appearance of facet-dependent heterogeneity of
I D
at higher bias? To address this question, we investigated the effect of large electric fields on the electronic structure of lead halide perovskites using first-principles DFT calculations including spin–orbit coupling (SOC). For electric fields larger than
∼ 10 5  V cm −1 , corresponding to 3–4 V across our thin films, we find that the methylammonium (MA) ions align with the electric field (see
Supplementary Methods ). This alignment is accompanied by displacements of the Pb ions relative to the I 6
octahedra in each unit cell, leading to an overall polarization of the crystal lattice ( Fig. 5d ) 39 , 40 , 41 , 42 . As shown in
Fig. 5e , this polarization results in an increase in the effective mass of electrons and holes along the direction of the electric field by a factor between 1.3 and 1.8 for the three directions of MA alignment examined. Assuming a constant charge density,
I D
is proportional to mobility and, thus, inversely proportional to the reduced effective mass, which increases under sufficiently large electric fields according to our DFT calculations. The internal electric field in MAPbI 3− x Cl x
films is approximately equal to ( V app
−
V OC )∕ d , where
V app
is the applied forward bias and
d
is the film thickness. Hence, we suggest that at a bias of 3 V, only facets with low
V OC
(higher trap state density) have an internal electric field sufficiently high to induce complete MA alignment and the corresponding polar Pb and I displacements. The 1.3 to 1.8 times increase in effective mass, as predicted by our calculations, explains the experimentally observed reduction in
I D
of 1.5 times between different facets on the same grain. On facets characterized by high
V OC , the internal electric fields do not surpass the necessary threshold, and the mobility remains high. This model explains the facet-dependent heterogeneity in
I D
at large bias and its spatial correlation with
V OC
( Supplementary Fig. 17 ). We did consider other hypotheses to describe the heterogeneity at high bias, such as variations in carrier concentration, scattering time, and ion migration, but our model based on the DFT calculations provides the best agreement with the experimental results (see
Supplementary Discussion ). Ion migration may influence the measured magnitude of
I D , but its effect is probably very small ( Supplementary Fig. 16 ). Facets with high trap state density can modify local
I D , an important insight for LED operation. Conclusion
In conclusion, we show significant intra-grain heterogeneity in short-circuit current, open-circuit voltage, and high bias drift current, as well as spatial correlation between these parameters, in state-of-the-art MAPbI 3− x Cl x
solar cell materials. The intra-grain heterogeneity in
V OC
and
I SC
is indicative of facet-dependent defect concentrations in these polycrystalline films.
V OC
heterogeneity has a direct effect on macroscale solar cell performance, but can also indirectly affect mobility due to local polarization at high forward bias, which might also impact LED applications. Based on these results, the efficiency of single-crystal and polycrystalline halide perovskite solar cells and LEDs can be systematically improved by controlling the growth direction of the grains and the orientation of the facets at interfaces with electron and hole conducting layers, as well as by chemical passivation of interfacial defect states. We are currently working toward growing high-quality MAPbI 3− x Cl x
films with different preferential crystal orientations to measure changes in heterogeneity with cAFM for correlation with macroscopic PCE. Our findings described here suggest that reproducible performance of devices at the scale of individual grains will rely on control of facet-specific defect properties. Methods Conductive atomic force microscopy. cAFM allows for the simultaneous measurement of current and topography. Measurements were performed using a Park Systems NX10 AFM encased in a nitrogen-filled glovebox to prevent sample degradation. Samples can be stored at least one week in the nitrogen atmosphere without degradation. All measurements were conducted with relative humidity less than 1%. The gentle PinPoint mode was the key to acquiring reproducible and reliable topography and cAFM images on the rough MAPbI 3− x Cl x
surfaces: the tip approached over a period of 5 ms to achieve an interaction force of 2 nN, the force was held constant while the current was sampled 80 times at 50 kHz, then the tip retracted over a period of 5 ms ( Fig. 1a ) and moved to the next pixel. The height at constant force is also recorded to generate a simultaneous topographic image. This method differs significantly from tapping mode because a contact mode tip is used, the tip is not oscillating, and the tip retracts and approaches at each pixel rather than adjusting the tip height to maintain a constant oscillation amplitude. This scan mode does require more time (approximately 2 h for a 512 × 512 pixel image), but results in highly reproducible images. The drift on our Park NX10 microscope was typically 10 nm h −1
in equilibrium ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ), and successive current scans were digitally aligned using the topographic image channel; thus, drift did not complicate interpretation of the results presented here. We chose these approach–retract conditions to achieve reproducible photocurrent measurements and to avoid effects of ion migration 28
(see
Supplementary Notes 2 and 3 ) since the tip is in contact for less than 1.6 ms with the sample—too fast for ion migration to play a role. In our cAFM set-up, the bias is applied to the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrode, while the Pt tip is at virtual ground. The current is measured directly after the tip using a preamplifier with a gain of 10 10  V/A. Because of this electrical configuration, negative voltage forward biases the cell and
I SC
has a positive value. Short-circuit current density ( J SC ) values were not calculated for the nanoscale measurements, because determining the contact area between the AFM tip and the sample at each pixel would be a gross approximation. For the photocurrent maps, the sample is illuminated from above with a white LED having an output from 375 to 800 nm and an integrated power density of 2.73 mW cm −2
(see
Supplementary Fig. 18
for the spectrum). Since initial light exposure modifies the performance of lead halide perovskites, we light-soaked the samples for an hour before characterizing the local performance under steady state conditions. AdvancedTEC ContPt AFM probes (Nanosensors) were employed because the tetrahedral tip protrudes from the end of the cantilever, which provides direct optical access to the point of contact between the tip apex and the sample (see
Supplementary Methods ). Shading of the sample by the cantilever was also prevented by using a 0.4 numerical aperture objective, which focuses the light with a 24-degree half-angle. These tips have a 25 nm radius of curvature and a 0.2 N m −1
force constant. Many tips were used to ensure that the tips were sharp and not contaminated by material from the perovskite surface. As soon as any tip modification was observed, we exchanged the tip. Data taken while the tip apex was modified were not considered for analysis. Sample preparation and device performance. The two-step low-pressure vapour-assisted solution process to fabricate the MAPbI 3− x Cl x
is described as follows 3 . First, a PbI 2 /PbCl 2
solution is spin coated onto titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) coated FTO glass substrates. Second, the film is converted to MAPbI 3− x Cl x
by annealing the film in CH 3 NH 3 I vapour at low pressure for 2 h. This fabrication technique creates continuous films and reduced hysteresis effects in a planar PV device architecture. Planar solar cells with the structure FTO/dense TiO 2 /MAPbI 3− x Cl x /2,20,7,70-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)–9,9-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD)/Au have an average PCE of 15.7%,
V OC
of 1.0 V, and short-circuit current density ( J SC ) of 21.3 mA cm −2
(ref.  3 ). A representative current density–voltage curve is shown in
Supplementary Fig. 1 . For the cAFM measurement, the MAPbI 3− x Cl x
surface must be exposed to correlate morphology and current. To directly access the perovskite surface, the spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer (HTL) and Au contact are omitted and the Pt-coated AFM tip acts as the electrode. A macroscale solar cell with a structure mimicking the cAFM measurement (FTO/TiO 2 /MAPbI 3− x Cl x /Pt) has a
V OC
of 0.51 V and
J SC  of 16.2 mA cm −2
(see
Supplementary Fig. 4
for a representative current–voltage curve). The significantly reduced

(ref.  19 ). Python image analysis. The Python code utilizes the Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) binary descriptor to match objects in the images, and the RANSAC method is use to filter the matches to determine the transform 43 . Image registration allowed for careful comparisons of
I D ,
I SC
and
V OC
of the exact same region. To compare
I SC
to the grain size, we used the watershed method to identify crystal grains and calculate the average
I SC
per grain. First-principles calculations. To understand the consequences of internal electric fields on the atomic and electronic structure of (CH 3 NH 3 )PbI 3 , we perform first-principles DFT calculations including spin–orbit coupling (SOC). DFT calculations were performed using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange correlation functional 44
and the projector augmented wave (PAW) 45
formalism as implemented in the Vienna
ab initio
Simulation Program (VASP) 46 . The tetragonal phase is described by a
√ 2 × √ 2 × 2
unit cell with four formula units, corresponding to a total of 48 atoms. We performed geometry optimizations of three structures with parallel alignment of the MA molecules in [001], [100] and [111] directions, using a 4 × 4 × 4 Γ-centred
k -point mesh and an energy cutoff of 500 eV. Starting from experimental lattice parameters 3 , we performed full structural relaxations where lattice constants, and internal degrees of freedom were allowed to relax. No symmetry constraints were imposed in these calculations, and forces were converged until smaller than 0.01 eV Å −1 . Band structures were calculated from charge densities obtained using a denser 6 × 6 × 6 Γ-centred k -point mesh, including semi-core states and spin–orbit interaction. Total energies and lattice parameters of all structures that we considered are shown in
Supplementary Table 1 . From the band structures, we calculated the effective electron and hole masses by parabolic band fitting around the conduction band minimum (CBM) and the valence band maximum (VBM), respectively, along the crystallographic high-symmetry directions. In the main text, we report the factor by which the reduced effective mass changes along the direction of MA alignment, since we assume that transport takes place along the direction of the applied electric field. For example, we show the factor by which the reduced effective mass changes along the crystallographic [001] direction on aligning the MA ions along this direction. This factor is defined as
m α, ∗ 001 ∕ m α=0°,
∗ 001 , where
m α,
∗ 001
=
m 001 e m 001 h ∕( m 001 e
+
m 001 h ) is the reduced effective mass for alignment angle α, and
m 001 e
and
m 001 h
are the respective electron and hole effective masses along the crystallographic [001] direction. The effective masses of all structures that we considered can be found in
Supplementary Table 2 . See

Synthesis and processing Two-dimensional materials
Abstract The application of strain to semiconductors allows for controlled modification of their band structure. This principle is employed for the manufacturing of devices ranging from high-performance transistors to solid-state lasers. Traditionally, strain is typically achieved via growth on lattice-mismatched substrates. For two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, this is not feasible as they typically do not interact epitaxially with the substrate. Here, we demonstrate controlled strain engineering of 2D semiconductors during synthesis by utilizing the thermal coefficient of expansion mismatch between the substrate and semiconductor. Using WSe 2
as a model system, we demonstrate stable built-in strains ranging from 1% tensile to 0.2% compressive on substrates with different thermal coefficient of expansion. Consequently, we observe a dramatic modulation of the band structure, manifested by a strain-driven indirect-to-direct bandgap transition and brightening of the dark exciton in bilayer and monolayer WSe 2 , respectively. The growth method developed here should enable flexibility in design of more sophisticated devices based on 2D materials.

Introduction Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have been the subject of focused research owing to their potential applications in optoelectronics and sub 10 nm transistors 1 ,
2 . The primary attraction of TMDCs such as MoS 2
and WSe 2
for both applications is their naturally terminated surface, which allows them to be scaled down to the atomic limit without the concern of surface dangling bonds. Furthermore, in many 2D materials, a number of desirable properties emerge at the monolayer limit, the most notable of which being the presence of a direct bandgap. Many studies based on mechanical bending of exfoliated 2D TMDCs have been conducted on flexible substrates, and they have shown that the application of strain can tune the properties of this new class of materials 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 . For example, it has been demonstrated that in multilayer WSe 2 , particularly in nominally indirect-gap bilayer WSe 2 , application of tensile strain can result in a transition from an indirect-to-direct bandgap 7 . However, studies on the effects of strain in TMDCs have been limited to mechanical bending of samples, and there has yet to be a technique, which can directly realize built-in tensile and compressive strains. Traditionally, strain engineering of semiconductors has been leveraged to tune the electronic band structure of high-performance devices, the most notable of which being to reduce intervalley scattering, increase mobility in Si transistors, and reduce the hole effective mass in III–V semiconductor lasers 8 ,
9 . Growth on epitaxial substrates with a controlled lattice constant mismatch has typically been utilized to establish built-in strain in three-dimensional semiconductors 10 . However, due to the relatively weak interaction between 2D materials and substrates, this established method of strain engineering is likely not applicable for the strain-engineered growth of TMDCs. Therefore, a route toward development of large-area strained TMDCs on a practical substrate is highly desirable. Significant research efforts have been made to realize large area TMDCs, with the majority of efforts focusing on chemical vapor deposition (CVD) 11 , 12 , 13 . Interestingly, a number of studies employing CVD growth of 2D materials have reported apparent strain in the synthesized samples 14 ,
15 . However, growth of high-quality 2D materials with controllable built-in strain has not been realized. Hence, properties that are difficult to probe via mechanical bending experiments, such as low-temperature optical measurements and electrical performance, have yet to be explored. In this work, we demonstrate strain engineering of 2D materials directly via CVD growth while simultaneously maintaining high material quality, by utilizing the thermal coefficient of expansion (TCE) mismatch between the TMDC and the growth substrate. Electron diffraction of strained monolayers grown directly onto transmission electron microscopy (TEM) windows is utilized to unambiguously quantify strain. Using WSe 2
as a model system, we show that it is possible to obtain both tensile (of ~ 1%) and compressive (0.2%) strained 2D semiconductors over large areas on rigid substrates. Furthermore, in the WSe 2
model system we show indirect-to-direct optical transition in tensile strained WSe 2
bilayers as well as removal of dark exciton quenching in WSe 2
monolayers. Results TCE-mismatch induced strain Owing to the high growth temperatures used to synthesize TMDCs, the TCE mismatch between the substrate and the 2D semiconductor can be utilized to control the strain in the synthesized 2D material, as shown schematically in Fig.  1 . The theoretical upper limit for the strain, assuming no relaxation, can be calculated using the difference in lattice constant of the substrate and 2D semiconductor at room temperature and synthesis temperature: $$\varepsilon \left( {{T_{\rm{g}}}} \right) = \frac{{{a_{2{\rm{D}}}}\left( {{T_{\rm{g}}}} \right) - {a_{2{\rm{D}}}}\left( {25\,^\circ {\rm{C}}} \right)}}{{{a_{2{\rm{D}}}}\left( {25\,^\circ {\rm{C}}} \right)}} - \frac{{{a_{{\rm{Sub}}}}\left( {{T_{\rm{g}}}} \right) - {a_{{\rm{Sub}}}}\left( {25\,^\circ {\rm{C}}} \right)}}{{{a_{{\rm{Sub}}}}\left( {25\,^\circ {\rm{C}}} \right)}}$$

To retain the strain generated from TCE-mismatch, the bonding between the 2D layer and the substrate must be sufficiently strong and corrugated to maintain the nonslip condition that transmits strain to the layer. Although one expects strains of this magnitude to arise during epitaxial growth, it is difficult to see how a similar strain can arise for films bound by van der Waals forces to an amorphous substrate. Experimentally, the corrugation in the film must be large enough to retain the strain upon cooling. To estimate the magnitude of the corrugation necessary to sustain the strain, we analyzed a 2D Frenkel–Kontorova model 16 , shown in Supplementary Note  1
and Supplementary Fig.  1 . This model suggests that atomic binding energy variations of as little as 14 meV over the range of the unit cell are capable of retaining strains of the magnitude of those observed experimentally. This variation is ~ 1% of a typical covalent bond strength, and very near to the typical strength of a van der Waals bond. Though a more detailed theory needs to be developed, especially to understand the surface chemistry immediately prior to growth to determine the nature of the bonding, this simple analysis suggests that thermal-expansion mismatch can strain a film, even in the case of weak binding between the film and the substrate. It should be noted that in a previous study, local heating of MoS 2
using a laser was used to generate strains of up to 0.2% arising from the TCE-mismatch of MoS 2
with the substrate 17 . Although this method does not generate built-in strains (strain is released once the laser is turned off), it suggests that the MoS 2 -substrate bonding is strong enough to enable TCE-mismatched induced strain engineering 17 . To demonstrate strain-engineered CVD growth of WSe 2 , four substrates were chosen, which have a range of TCEs. Fused silica and aluminum nitride (AlN) have a TCE of 0.55 and 5.5 ppm, respectively, much smaller than that of WSe 2
(9.5 ± 3.2 ppm), and would be expected to induce tensile strain 3 ,
18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 . In contrast, sapphire has a TCE closely matched to WSe 2
and would be expected to produce relaxed samples and strontium titanate (STO) with a TCE of 12 ppm should yield compressively strained samples 20 ,
23 ,
24 . The sample was rapidly quenched after growth to limit relaxation in the WSe 2 . It is important to note that the rapid quenching process was found to be important in maintaining the presence of strain, and delay of the quenching step can result in partial relaxation of the 2D material. Characterization strain and material quality To characterize the strain present in the as-grown material, multiple characterization methods were utilized. First, electron diffraction was performed on WSe 2
as-grown on SiO 2
TEM grids and WSe 2
transferred to SiO 2
TEM grids. The resulting diffraction patterns are shown in Figs.  2a–c . In all TEM diffraction measurements on WSe 2 , the camera length and lens aberrations of the imaging systems were calibrated using polycrystalline aluminum and single crystal aluminum calibration samples (Ted Pella), and the microscope lens settings were left constant for all subsequent measurements. Corresponding images and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the samples in Figs.  2b, c
are shown in Supplementary Fig.  2 . By comparing the lattice constant extracted from the diffraction patterns of strained (as-grown) and unstrained (transferred) WSe 2 , and utilizing the center of mass for 75 diffraction spots from each pattern, we calculate that a 1.39 ± 0.28% tensile strain is present in the as-grown sample. The calculated error represents the standard deviation in lattice constant value over 75 measured diffraction spots. Raman spectrum shown in Fig.  2d
reveals a shift of the E’ in-plane Raman mode of 1.5 ± 0.2 cm −1
between as-grown and transferred WSe 2 . We note that the strain measured here is biaxial, not uniaxial, in contrast to mechanical bending studies and thus we do not observe splitting of the E′ mode. Therefore, the theoretically calculated value for the Grüneisen parameter (﻿ χ ﻿) of WSe 2
is used to calculate the expected peak shift according to:
\(\omega \left( \varepsilon \right) = {\omega _0} + {\rm{\chi}}\varepsilon\) , which is consistent with the approximately 1% tensile strain measured via diffraction 25 , 26 , 27 . It should also be noted that after transfer the E’ mode shows no shift relative to samples prepared either by exfoliation or as-grown on sapphire. High resolution Raman mapping was performed and is shown in Figs.  2e, f
for WSe 2
crystals as-grown on fused silica and transferred to a new fused silica substrate, respectively. We observe a uniform Raman shift throughout the full WSe 2
domain for both samples indicating that the strain is uniformly distributed within the sample on the scale of the Raman spot size. In addition, PL and atomic force microscopy images of as-grown WSe 2
on fused silica are shown in Supplementary Fig.  3 . Fig. 2 Transmission electron microscopy images and Raman spectroscopy of monolayer WSe 2 .

PL measurements were employed to measure the bandgap as a function of strain. Figure  3a
shows PL spectra of samples grown on all substrates investigated in this work as well as an exfoliated reference. There is a large spectral shift of 120 meV between samples grown on fused silica with near zero TCE and STO, which has the highest TCE of all substrates investigated in this work. Figure  3b
shows the estimated strain from the PL peak shift as a function of predicted strain in WSe 2 , vs. the lattice mismatch between the substrate and TMDC lattice constant. Strain values are determined from the experimentally measured PL peak position (measurement error was calculated using the standard deviation of strain measured from fifteen different crystals) and theoretically calculated bandgap as a function of strain extracted from refs
3 ,
27 . It is important to note that we utilized the difference in peak position relative to an unstrained sample to eliminate effects from absolute bandgap error relative to theoretical calculations. We performed an analysis of the expected strain due to lattice parameter misfit (Supplementary Table  1
and Supplementary Note  2 ) to rule out the influence of epitaxial strain between the substrate and WSe 2 . From this calculation, the expected strain from the lattice mismatch shows the opposite trend as compared with what we observe experimentally. We find that our experimentally realized strain per ΔTCE of −0.10 ± 0.01% per ppm K −1
is in excellent agreement with the theoretical value of −0.09% per ppm K −1 . To verify that the substrate does not affect the PL peak shape or position of monolayer WSe 2 , samples were transferred to the four substrates used in this study (Supplementary Fig.  4 ) and no shift of the PL peak was observed. The impact of growth temperature to tune the strain was also studied using fused silica as the substrate. Figure  3c
shows the tensile strain in monolayer WSe 2
grown at different temperatures, estimated using PL peak position. We are able to tune the strain from 0.94 ± 0.06% to 0.67 ± 0.05% as the growth temperature is changed from 900 to 673 °C. PL spectra corresponding to Fig.  3c
is shown in Supplementary Fig.  5 . Fig. 3 Strain engineering of 2D materials.

Tensile strain engineering of mono- and bilayer WSe 2
Calibrated PL measurements were used to provide a gauge of material quality. We find that strained WSe 2
monolayers as-grown on fused silica show comparable PL intensity to exfoliated WSe 2 , demonstrating that strain engineering of 2D materials can be achieved without compromising material performance. Specifically, as exfoliated samples show a typical quantum yield (QY) of 2.3 ± 0.4%, while samples grown on fused silica show a typical QY of 1.9 ± 0.6%. Upon transfer, the strain within the as-grown material is released and its emission peak shifts to 1.65 eV, closely matching that of exfoliated samples, as shown in Fig.  4a . In addition to emission, the absorption spectrum of the as-grown monolayer was measured and is shown in Fig.  4b . The absorption spectra clearly shows that the A and B exciton resonances are red-shifted with the presence of tensile strain, and are consistent with the observed shift in the emission. Interestingly, the absorption of the C exciton peak shows no shift between the as-grown and exfoliated samples, which is consistent with previously reported mechanical bending experiments on exfoliated monolayers, although it should be noted that in these experiments the strain was uniaxial 28 .

More interestingly, it has been previously demonstrated using bending experiments that under the application of a uniaxial strain of ~ 1.5%, bilayer WSe 2
undergoes an indirect-to-direct bandgap transition 7 . This effect is caused by an increase in the energy level of the indirect valley at the Σ point as well as a corresponding decrease in the energy level of the direct valley at the K point 7 . While it is important to note these results are obtained under uniaxial strain, similar trends between uniaxial and biaxial strain have been observed in theoretical studies on other 2D material systems 29 . Figure  4c
depicts the PL spectra of as-grown, exfoliated and transferred bilayer WSe 2 . In the as-grown strained bilayer, we observe a single sharp PL peak, as oppose to a broader spectrum corresponding to emission from both the indirect and direct bandgaps observed in the unstrained exfoliated and transferred samples. Moreover, the intensity of the PL is reduced by approximately 50 times upon transfer and resultant release of tensile strain as shown in Fig.  4c . This phenomenon can possibly be attributed to the optical transition from indirect-to-direct in bilayer WSe 2
in the presence of tensile strain. This is in good agreement with previous reports on the indirect-to-direct optical transition of WSe 2
through bending experiments, although these previous studies utilized uniaxial strain 7 . The normalized PL spectra for bilayer WSe 2
grown on fused silica after transfer, as well as unstrained samples grown on sapphire and prepared by exfoliation, are shown in Supplementary Fig.  6
and show a very similar spectral shape. Absorption of WSe 2
bilayer samples was also measured and is shown in Fig.  4d . To further characterize WSe 2
monolayers, we performed low-temperature PL measurements. Numerous studies have experimentally observed that the PL of monolayer WSe 2
is quenched at reduced temperatures. This behavior is unusual for a direct bandgap semiconductor and has been attributed to the formation of dark excitons with an energy level ~ 30 meV below the bright state 30 ,
31 . It has been hypothesized that at low temperatures the bright exciton is allowed to relax to the lower energy level resulting in a reduction of the PL QY. Conversely, both theoretical and experimental studies have suggested that unstrained monolayer WSe 2
is an indirect-gap semiconductor, with a small (< 3kT) energy difference between the indirect and direct gaps 32 ,
33 . Upon cooling of exfoliated monolayer WSe 2
samples, we observe results similar to what has been previously reported as shown in the inset of Fig.  5a , which is a reduction in PL emission at low temperatures. However, for the case of tensile strained monolayer WSe 2
as-grown on fused silica we observe the opposite trend (Fig.  5 ). As the temperature is reduced from 300 to 6 K the PL intensity increases by over an order of magnitude, resulting in a final PL QY of 14% as shown in Fig.  5d . The nature of the physical mechanism for the dramatic difference in the temperature-dependent behavior can be directly attributed to band structure modification due to the presence of strain. However, it remains unclear if this is due to an indirect-to-direct bandgap transition or an increase in the energy level of the dark state.

Discussion In summary, we have demonstrated controlled and stable strain engineering of 2D materials by growth, realized through TCE mismatch between the substrate and 2D material. The demonstrated strain engineering allows for dramatic modulation of the physical properties of 2D materials. Using WSe 2
as a model system, we have achieved a strain induced indirect-to-direct optical transition in directly grown WSe 2
bilayer, resulting in an amplification of the PL intensity by over fifty times. We have also shown tunable PL emission of WSe 2
monolayer, whereas maintaining its high performance. Notably, in the monolayer case under tensile strain, we observed increasing luminescence at reduced temperatures, in stark contrast with what has been reported in the unstrained exfoliated material, suggesting that strain can be utilized to brighten the dark exciton. This practical route for the direct realization of strain engineering in 2D materials can allow for the characterization of device properties as a function of strain as well as enable optical measurements that are not accessible to samples strained by physical bending or stretching. Our work depicts that biaxial strains of 1% tensile to 0.2% compressive can be obtained by using readily achievable differences in the thermal expansion coefficients by choosing an appropriate growth substrate. By expanding upon this method, it may be possible to obtain uniaxial strain via growth on substrates with anisotropic thermal expansion coefficients or obtain significantly higher strain values via growth on piezoelectric substrates 34 ,
35 . Methods Material growth WSe 2
was grown on several substrates with varying thermal expansion coefficients using CVD. Specifically, growth was performed on fused silica (amorphous), aluminum nitride (c-plane), Sapphire (c-plane), or strontium titanate (<100>); all substrates were electronic grade and have a root mean square surface roughness of <10 Å. Substrates were first cleaned by sonication in acetone and isopropyl alcohol for 10 min. The growth was carried out using a two-heating-zone furnace (DaePoong Industry, 50602); a schematic of the growth setup is shown in Supplementary Fig.  7 . The cleaned substrates were loaded into the downstream zone, and a ceramic boat containing mixture of WO 3
and potassiu﻿m bromide (KBr) was then placed next to the substrates. KBr was mixed with WO 3
at a ratio of 1:2, with the KBr acting as a promoter for the growth. This is similar to methods described in ref.
36 . However, we found that several salts can be used and the choice of promoter has a significant role in determining the ultimate sample morphology (this is further discussed in the  Supplementary Methods ). It should be noted that regardless of the promoter used, the strain present in the sample was unaffected as shown in Supplementary Fig.  8 . A ceramic boat containing 500 mg Se powder was placed in the center of the upstream zone. After loading, the quartz tube was evacuated and Ar was introduced at 60 sccm resulting in a pressure of 2.6 Torr. The temperature of upstream zone was then ramped to 100 °C and the downstream furnace was subsequently ramped to a setpoint of 825 °C. The set point of the upstream zone was adjusted such that the residual heat from the downstream zone results in vaporization of Se. Once the temperature of downstream furnace was stabilized, hydrogen was introduced at a flow rate of 40 sccm (total pressure of 3 Torr). This initiates the growth as the presence of hydrogen is required to decompose and vaporize WO x
37 . The growth time used was 15 min. Once the growth is complete, hydrogen flow was stopped, and the furnace was opened to rapidly cool the sample. The influence of the H 2 /Ar ratio, growth time and growth pressure is discussed in the  Supplementary Methods
and are shown in Supplementary Figs  9 – 11 . Optical microscope images of samples grown on various substrates is shown in Supplementary Fig.  12 . Specific growth conditions were tuned to optimize the PL QY of the as-grown samples and to either promote growth of bilayer or monolayer domains (discussed in  Supplementary Methods ). It should be noted that for growths where the substrate temperature was varied the WO 3 /KBr boat was placed in the center of the first heating zone and the Se boat was placed at the edge of the first heating zone. The substrates were placed in the center of the second heating zone. The position of Se boat was adjusted to control the temperature. Transfer of grown WSe 2
is done using a HF based wet transfer technique with PMMA as the transfer medium using the specific procedure described in ref.
11 . The electrical performance of CVD WSe 2
grown on fused silica and transferred to Si/SiO 2
is also compared to that of exfoliated samples, and is shown in Supplementary Fig.  13 . Transmission electron microscopy WSe 2
monolayers were directly grown and transferred on 8 nm thick SiO 2
membranes (Ted Pella) for electron diffraction measurements in order to directly measure the lattice constant of the strained and unstrained samples, respectively. Electron diffraction measurements were performed at the National Center for Electron Microscopy at LBNL using a FEI Titan 60–300 microscope operated at 80 kV with parallel beam illumination. Optical characterization The PL data presented in this work was obtained using a custom built micro-PL instrument described in detail in ref.
1 . In brief, measurements were performed using the continuous wave 514.5 nm line of an Ar +
laser (Lexel 95) and the laser power was adjusted using neutral density filters. The laser was focused on the sample using an 80 × objective lens (NA = 0.9). The PL signal was measured using the same objective lens, passed through a 550 nm dielectric longpass filter, dispersed by a
f  = 340 mm spectrometer with a 150 g mm −1
grating, and detected using by an Si CCD camera (Andor iDus BEX2-DD). Prior to each measurement the CCD background was obtained and subsequently subtracted from the PL acquisition. The sensitivity of the instrument as a function of wavelength (instrument function) was determined through measurement of a virtual Lambertian blackbody source under the objective, created by imaging the illumination from a temperature stabilized lamp (ThorLabs SLS201) on a diffuse reflector (Spectralon). The system efficiency was determined by measuring the response of the excitation laser focused onto a diffuse reflector (Spectralon), with the 550 nm longpass filter removed. The measured external quantum efficiency was converted to QY using sample absorption at the pump wavelength and the fraction of light, which is able to escape the sample (1/4 n
2 , where
n
is the refractive index of the medium). All measurements shown in this work were performed at an incident power of 1.5 W cm −2
(corresponding to a laser power of 200 nW). This laser power is significantly below the onset of biexcitonic recombination in WSe 2
38 . Low temperature measurements were performed using a long working distance 50 × objective lens in a micro-cryostat (Janis) with an infrasil window. The procedure described previously was used to calculate the sample PL efficiency. PL imaging was performed on the samples to determine their uniformity. Measurements were performed using a florescence microscopy setup using a 470 nm light emitting diode as the excitation source and a CCD detector (Andor Luca). Raman measurements and high-resolution mapping were performed to characterize the strain in the WSe 2 . Raman spectra were obtained using a WITec Alpha 300RA equipped with a piezo electric scanning stage. The sample was excited using the 532 nm line of a frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser as the excitation source and focused on the sample using a 100 × objective.

Nanoscale devices Solar cells
Abstract Control over morphology and crystallinity of metal halide perovskite films is of key importance to enable high-performance optoelectronics. However, this remains particularly challenging for solution-printed devices due to the complex crystallization kinetics of semiconductor materials within dynamic flow of inks. Here we report a simple yet effective meniscus-assisted solution printing (MASP) strategy to yield large-grained dense perovskite film with good crystallization and preferred orientation. Intriguingly, the outward convective flow triggered by fast solvent evaporation at the edge of the meniscus ink imparts the transport of perovskite solutes, thus facilitating the growth of micrometre-scale perovskite grains. The growth kinetics of perovskite crystals is scrutinized by
in situ
optical microscopy tracking to understand the crystallization mechanism. The perovskite films produced by MASP exhibit excellent optoelectronic properties with efficiencies approaching 20% in planar perovskite solar cells. This robust MASP strategy may in principle be easily extended to craft other solution-printed perovskite-based optoelectronics.

Introduction Solution printing is widely recognized as an attractive route to cost-effective, high-throughput and large-area thin film optoelectronics 1 , 2 , 3 . In this technique, the ink solution containing semiconductor precursors or nanoparticles can be readily deposited on a variety of desirable substrates, offering precise control over stoichiometry and rendering ubiquitous adaptability and compatibility with patterned and flexible substrates 4 . As state-of-the-art direct bandgap semiconductors, metal halide perovskites capitalize on superior optoelectronic characteristics such as intense broadband absorption, large ambipolar mobility, long charge carrier lifetime, and low processing cost compared with inorganic counterparts (e.g., silicon, CIGS and CdTe) 5 , 6 . The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solution-processed metal halide perovskite solar cells has rapidly leapfrogged from 3.8% to 22.1% over the past several years 7 , 8 . Notably, top-performing perovskite solar cells have recently been advanced largely by optimizing the crystal morphology of methylammonium lead halides (MAPbX 3 , X=I, Br and Cl), formamidinium lead halides (FAPbX 3 ), and their combinations 9 , 10 , 11 . However, the requirement of morphology control has posed a great challenge for solution-printed perovskite films due to the limited understanding of crystallization in dynamic flow of perovskite inks. It is important to note that photoluminescence spectroscopy has revealed that the trap-assisted non-radiative charge recombination dominates the efficiency loss in perovskite solar cells 12 , 13 . The existence of charge traps is strongly associated with the disorder of crystals caused by ionized impurities, lattice vacancies and interstices and grain-boundary defects within perovskite film 14 . Through improving the crystallization, charge traps inside high-crystallinity perovskites exist at shallow states, yet deep traps are still massively present near the grain boundary region 15 . Recently, several solution-processed routes to micrometre-sized perovskite grains by crafting films at high temperatures (for example, spin coating at 180 °C for MAPbI 3(1− x ) Cl 3 x
and doctor-blading at 145 °C for FA x MA 1− x PbI 3 , 0≤ x ≤1) have been successfully implemented to reduce the areas of grain boundary and minimize the trap-induced energy loss 16 , 17 . One notion behind these effective approaches is that the grain-boundary motion depends strongly on the temperature, and a high temperature can stimulate solute atoms more easily to overcome the diffusion energy barrier, thus resulting in fast grain growth rate 18 , 19 . Nevertheless, solution printing may not be amenable to high-temperature preparative conditions that are close to the boiling point,
T bp , of typical solvents used for dissolving perovskites (for example, dimethylformamide (DMF),
T bp, DMF = ∼ 152 °C; dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO),
T bp, DMSO = ∼ 189 °C), as the ink solution is too volatile to render the control over the crystal morphology. In addition to increased energy consumption, high-temperature treatment is also likely to cause thermal degradation and thermo-mechanical fatigue of perovskite and electrode materials, especially for flexible electrodes such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) 20 . Clearly, a low-temperature strategy for morphological control of solution-printed perovskite films is highly desirable, which has yet to be explored. Here we report on a versatile meniscus-assisted solution printing (MASP) strategy to create highly crystallized perovskite films with micrometre-scale grains and preferred crystal orientations at low temperatures for high-efficiency perovskite solar cells. Specifically, a meniscus is formed due to capillary action by constraining the perovskite ink between a lower substrate and an upper plate. The fast solvent evaporation at the edge (that is, the air/perovskite ink/lower substrate three-phase contact line) of the meniscus triggers an outward convective flow to replenish the evaporative loss of solvent and meanwhile transports the perovskite solutes toward the contact line due to the coffee ring effect 21 , 22 , 23 . This yields a perovskite supersaturated phase containing continually aggregated solutes, promoting the nucleation and growth of perovskite crystals. Through placing the lower substrate on a programmed translational stage, the receding meniscus can be slowly and progressively swept across the entire lower substrate, thereby printing a continuous perovskite film on the substrate. We note that the MASP deposition is inspired by solution-coating techniques in the field of organic semiconductor processing 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 . For solution-based coating of metal halide perovskite materials, doctor-blade coating has been widely employed to deposit perovskite thin films or microwires for optoelectronic applications 28 , 29 . In contrast to the deposition of perovskite solutes by doctor-blade coating with which the solvent evaporation is driven by applying high temperatures 28 , 29 , 30 , MASP promotes the perovskite crystallization by accelerating the solvent evaporation through the meniscus effect. The crystallization mechanism of perovskite films crafted by MASP is revealed by in-situ optical microscopy investigation into the crystal growth kinetics. As such, it provides insights into the precise control over the crystal morphology and crystallinity of perovskite films. The produced perovskite films possess preferred crystal orientations and enhanced optoelectronic properties. A high PCE approaching 20% is achieved in the planar perovskite solar cells assembled using the MASP-enabled perovskite films as the photoactive layers. Results Outward convective flow within meniscus perovskite ink A complex stoichiometry of FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
containing two mixed organic cations (that is, FA 0.85 MA 0.15 ) and two mixed halides (that is, I 2.55 Br 0.45 ) is selected as the perovskite material because of its enhanced efficiency and stability as compared to MAPbI 3
(ref.
31 ). In particular, FAPbI 3
has a lower bandgap than that of MAPbI 3
and thus is beneficial for increasing light harvesting, and MAPbBr 3
improves the stability of the FAPbI 3
perovskite phase. A scheme of crafting large perovskite crystal grains by MASP is illustrated in
Fig. 1a . The metal halide perovskite ink FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
in DMSO was loaded in a two-nearly-parallel-plate geometry where the lower flat substrate can be moved against the upper stationary plate in a programmable manner. The separation distance between these two plates was fixed at 300 μm to form a concave meniscus held by capillary force. An important signature of capillary action is the presence of a meniscus at the edge of the confined ink.

shows a representative side-view optical micrograph of confined meniscus ink, where the velocity of outward convective flow

induced by solvent evaporation can be described by Navier-Stokes equation with the lubrication approximation ( Supplementary Note 1 ) 22 , 32 : Figure 1: Meniscus-assisted solution printing of FA 0.85 >MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45

t
is time,
ρ
is the density of solution,
r
is the horizontal distance of the meniscus surface away from the bulk ink, and
h
is the height of the meniscus at
r . As the volume of loaded ink is sufficient for completing the printing process, the shape of the meniscus remains relatively unchanged with time, and thus the
∂
h/
∂
t
term can be neglected. Equation (1) can then be simplified as: We fitted the experimentally measured outline of the meniscus with a parabolic equation
h = a ·( R − r ) b , where
h
is dependent on the moving speed of the lower substrate (that is, the coating speed of perovskite). The theoretical fit agreed well the experimental meniscus outline (that is, the red dashed curve in
Fig. 1b ). The evaporative flux
J e
can be described by the non-equilibrium one-sided (NEOS) model ( Supplementary Note 1 ) 33 : where

W
is the thermal effect given by
( k
is the liquid thermal conductivity,
k s

d 0
is the liquid thickness and
d s
is the thickness of substrate). By combining Equation (3) with Equation (2), the outward flow velocity
v
as a function of the distance
r
away from the bulk ink can be obtained: According to Equations (3) and (4), we can derive that the outward convective flow increases sharply at the meniscus edge ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ), as the solvent evaporation is faster toward the edge of the meniscus ink, correspondingly transporting the solutes to the meniscus front and leading to the perovskite supersaturated phase at the edge. Process of meniscus-assisted solution printing As a result, FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
solutes gradually precipitate out from the supersaturated phase and grow into large crystals as the outward flow continuously transport more solutes to the edge of the meniscus. A real-time tracking of the perovskite crystal growth by optical microscopy is shown in
Fig. 1c , depicting the evolution of a perovskite nucleus into a large-grained microstructure ( Supplementary Movie 1 ). At time
t 0 , a relatively small perovskite grain (marked with the white arrow) appeared in the front of meniscus ink with an effective diameter of
∼ 4 μm. As time progressed (that is, from
t 0 +1 s,
t 0 +4 s, to
t 0 +7 s), the grain underwent a two-dimensional (2D) growth to a large crystal island ( Supplementary Fig. 2a ). Eventually, the grain growth slowed down when it was connected with other adjacent grains (that is,
t 0 +12 s), accompanied by the coalescence of neighbouring grains ( Supplementary Fig. 2b ). We note that the perovskite grain growth is expected to initially follow a normal three-dimensional (3D) mode before its size becomes comparable to the film thickness (that is,
∼ 900 nm,
Supplementary Fig. 3 ) 18 . However, the grain size at the initial stage was too small to be accurately seen and tracked by optical microscopy. Once the grain size exceeded the film thickness, the perpendicular growth was suppressed due to the specimen thickness effect in thin films 35 , resulting in the observed 2D growth. The lower substrate mounted on the translational stage was moved at a constant speed of 12 μm s −1
in the direction opposite to the receding meniscus. As a result, the evaporative front progressively swept across the entire substrate to print a continuous film composed of large perovskite grains ( Supplementary Movie 2 ), and no stick-slip motion was observed.
Figure 1d
shows a representative scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the perovskite film crafted by MASP, revealing that FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite grains with a size of 20–80 μm were densely packed together without observable voids at grain boundaries. A low-magnification SEM image in
Supplementary Fig. 4a
further displays a uniform morphology over a few millimetres. We observed that a uniform morphology can only be achieved when the coating speed
v c
(that is,
v c =12 μm s −1 ) was close to the receding speed of the meniscus edge due to solvent evaporation. When the coating speed (for example,
v c =2 μm s −1 ) was slower than the meniscus receding speed, the meniscus edge was found to quickly reach the edge of the upper plate. As a result, the perovskite crystals bridged the upper plate and the lower substrate ( Supplementary Fig. 4b ). On the other hand, when the coating speed (for example,
v c =50 μm s −1 ) was faster than the meniscus receding speed, a liquid layer rather than a solid film was coated on the substrate. The liquid layer then dried to form discontinuous perovskite crystals as shown in
Supplementary Fig. 4c . Recently, a physical model has been built to predict the optimal window for the coating speed by estimating the equilibrium front evaporation speed
v efe
in the evaporation regime of meniscus coating 36 . We employ this model to further analyse the influence of the substrate temperature, the boiling point of solvent, the solvent density, and the meniscus geometrical factor in the MASP process on the front evaporation speed of DMSO ( Supplementary Note 2 ). The calculated
v efe
of DMSO at 60 °C is 4 μm s −1
( Supplementary Fig. 5a ) and the optimized coating speed
v c
we used in MASP was 12 μm s −1 , thus the normalized coating speed
= v c / v efe =3, suggesting that this model may be able to predict the optimal window of the coating speed via estimating the front solvent evaporation rate. In addition, we found that there was also an optimal substrate temperature (that is,
T= 60±10 °C) for depositing uniform FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite films by MASP. Following this optimal operation window (that is,
v c =12 μm s −1
and
T =60 °C), the two-nearly-parallel-plate geometry, the substrate temperature, and the coating speed were thus fixed. We can adjust the film thickness by simply varying the perovskite precursor solution concentration.
Supplementary Fig. 5b
shows the thickness of MASP-deposited FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite film as a function of the solution concentration. We also characterized the morphology of the spin-coated FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite film as reference. The SEM image showed that the spin-coated perovskite film comprised the nanoscale grains with a size of 50–300 nm ( Supplementary Fig. 6a ). The cross-sectional SEM image revealed a typical film thickness of 780±20 nm ( Supplementary Fig. 6b ). The elemental mapping of the spin-coated FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite film was measured by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), verifying that the spin-coated film had a uniform composition dispersion (that is, Pb, Br and I) ( Supplementary Fig. 7 ). The presence of high-quality micrometre-sized grains within these large FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite grains was corroborated by the well-defined selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (that is, selected area size=2 μm,
Supplementary Fig. 8 ) shown as an inset in
Fig. 1d , which can be attributed to a trigonal perovskite crystal with the (110) plane preferentially parallel to the substrate ( Supplementary Method 1 ;
Supplementary Fig. 9 ) 37 . However, the spin-coated FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite film showed ring-type SAED patterns ( Supplementary Fig. 10 ), implying that there was no preferred crystal orientation and the film had a polycrystalline structure. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles of the FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite film prepared by MASP and the reference sample prepared by spin coating are shown in
Fig. 1e . All diffraction peak positions of these two films agreed well with the simulated XRD profile of a trigonal perovskite crystal with the space group
P 3 m 1. Notably, the relative intensity ratio of ( 40)/(024) to ( 11) was increased for the film prepared by MASP, implying that the MASP film possessed the preferred crystal orientation along the < 20>/<012> direction ( Supplementary Method 2 ;
Supplementary Fig. 11 ). In particular, the <012>-oriented FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
trigonal crystal forms a corner-sharing lead halide octahedral network with a long-range order ( Supplementary Fig. 9d ), which is an ideal structure for effective charge transport across the perovskite film 38 . It is noteworthy that the high-purity trigonal perovskite crystals were directly formed at a relatively low temperature (that is, 60 °C) by MASP ( Supplementary Fig. 12 ), thereby dispensing with the need for high-temperature treatment in the spin-coated films in order to convert the DMSO-incorporated intermediate to perovskite phase ( Supplementary Note 3 ). We also note that the diffraction peak positions of the FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite film prepared by MASP were not completely the same as those prepared by spin coating. For example, there is a small right shift of 2 θ =0.26 o
for the ( ) peak in the spin-coated film. The differences in the diffraction peak positions suggested that the stoichiometry of the perovskite films prepared by MASP and spin coating may be slightly different. Thus, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed to identify the chemical composition of perovskite films. Clearly, the perovskite film prepared by MASP had the real chemical composition of (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.14
( Supplementary Fig. 13 ), which was almost consistent with the stoichiometry of the perovskite precursors in the ink. However, for the spin-coated perovskite film, the real chemical composition was found to be (FAPbI 3 ) 0.82 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.13.
The MASP technique not only entail a relatively low-temperature deposition of FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite films with high crystallinity, but also facilitate the formation of micrometer-scale perovskite grains with preferred crystal orientations. Conceivably, the resulting perovskite films may demonstrate advantageous optoelectronic properties. Growth kinetics of perovskite crystals To further understand the crystallization mechanism of perovskites crafted by MASP, we turn our attention to scrutinize the growth kinetics of FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
crystals by real-time optical microscopy measurement.
Figure 2a
depicts the area of the tracked FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
crystal island as a function of time. A two-stage crystal growth is observed, namely, a quadratic increase of crystal area with time at the early stage of growth and a linear increase of crystal area with time at the late stage. It is worth noting that this growth pattern is analogous to the vacuum deposition of organic crystals on substrate 39 , 40 , except that the atom transferring medium in MASP is a liquid flow. In this context, we examine the perovskite crystal growth kinetics according to the scaling capture zone model 41 , 42 , in which the crystal growth is essentially governed by the accessible collection area for solutes and the solute diffusion length 41 . The accessible collection area of the FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
crystal island can be estimated by its Voronoi cell that included all solutes closer to this specific island than to any others 43 . The central point of each island (that is, red dots in
Fig. 2b,c ) is labelled as the nucleation centre to diagram the Voronoi cell. The good agreement between the Voronoi cell topographies and the obtained perovskite island shapes suggests a strong correlation between the crystal growth and the accessible collection area 40 . At the early growth stage of the FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite island with its centre labelled as P ( Fig. 2b ), the effective radius
R eff
of the island was relatively small (that is,
R eff,t0
= ∼ 4 μm at time
t 0 ), the Voronoi cell radius
R Vor
of the island at time
t 0
was very large (that is,
R Vor,t0 >100 μm) as it was isolated far from other neighbouring crystals. In the case of
R eff + δ < R Vor , the crystal growth rate was mainly determined by the solute diffusion length
δ
toward the island, and thus a quadratic crystal growth emerged and can be described by d A/ d t=k q (2π δ
R eff +πδ 2 ), where
A=π
is the island area, and
k q
is the rate constant 39 , 44 . The value of
δ
was then derived by fitting the measured island size to the quadratic growth equation, yielding
δ =4 μm. We note that the EDS measurement showed a uniform elemental mapping of the FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite island ( Supplementary Fig. 14 ), suggesting that the diffusion lengths of various solutes (that is, FA, MA, Pb, I and Br) were possibly comparable and did not generate obvious composition segregation in perovskite crystals during MASP. The evaporation-induced outward convective flow is expected to facilitate the solute diffusion and promote the crystal growth rate at this stage. The relationship
R eff + δ < R Vor
changed to
R eff + δ > R Vor,
as the FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite island grew larger (that is,
R eff,t9 = ∼ 51 μm at time
t 0 +9 s). Meanwhile more new adjacent crystals emerged as evidenced in
Fig. 2c , the tracked island had to compete with the neighbours for collecting the perovskite solutes, leading to smaller
R Vor
(that is,
R Vor,t9 = ∼ 48 μm at time
t 0 +9 s). As a result, the crystal growth rate was largely determined by the accessible collection area of the island, giving rise to a linear crystal growth (d A/ d t = k l A Vor , where
A Vor
is the area of the Voronoi cell, and
k l
is the rate constant) 39 , 44 . Figure 2: Growth kinetics of FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45

to

to

perovskites with varied chemical compositions (0.05≤ x ≤0.25), and they all follow the two-stage growth kinetics ( Supplementary Fig. 15 ). In order to further verify the reliability of the observed crystal growth kinetics, we analyse the growth rates of a number of FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
crystal islands (that is, a total of 18 islands shown in
Fig. 2d ) in a single real-time tracking by optical microscopy. As the islands were isolated far from each other at the early stage, only the growth rates at the late stage were monitored, that is, the crystal growth followed the condition of
R eff
+
δ > R Vor . The average crystal growth rate and the corresponding Voronoi cell area of each island from time
to
+3 s were calculated ( Supplementary Fig. 16 ;
Supplementary Movie 3 ). A linear relationship d A/ d t=k l A Vor
was indeed also observed for these islands with varied sizes and growth rates ( Fig. 2e ). The origin of the linear crystal growth is that the solute density varies slowly in the crystallization regime when the solute diffusion rate is comparable with the solute crystallization rate, and the crystallization regime can be approximated as a steady state, thereby enabling the statistics studies of the diffusion equation with appropriate boundary conditions for simple island configuration 42 . On the basis of this crystal growth kinetics, it is suggested that the final size of the perovskite crystals yielded by MASP depends strongly on the nucleation density, and a lower nucleation density facilitates the growth of large crystals due to a fewer competitors for solutes. Furthermore, the nucleation density relies on the evaporation-driven outward convective flow (that is, faster outward flow leading to higher nucleation density) within the meniscus ink, which can be tuned by adjusting the meniscus height, the solvent density, the substrate temperature, and the substrate moving speed 36 , 45 . Optoelectronic performances of perovskites films Intrigued by the attractive features of micrometer-sized grains and preferred crystal orientations, we set out to investigate the photophysical properties of MASP-enabled perovskite films.
Figure 3a
compares the ultraviolet-visible (UV–Vis) absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite film crafted by MASP and the film prepared by spin coating ( Supplementary Method 3 ). The PL peak of the MASP film exhibited a
∼ 20 meV red-shift compared to that of the spin-coated film ( Supplementary Fig. 17a ). Since the Stokes shifts for both films were almost negligible (that is,
∼ 5 meV), accordingly, a red-shift of the absorption onset edge was seen ( Supplementary Fig. 17b and 17c ), implying that the MASP film had a slightly lower bandgap than that of the spin-coated film. Moreover, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the PL spectrum was narrowed by
∼ 26 meV for the MASP film, suggesting that the MASP film contained fewer crystalline defects 16 , 46 . The low Urbach energy (that is,
∼ 19 meV,
Fig. 3b ) further confirmed the presence of reduced localization disordering within the MASP-enabled FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite film 47 . The charge carrier lifetime was measured by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy ( Fig. 3c ). The charge carrier lifetimes in the MASP perovskite film (that is,
τ 1 =70±5 ns and
τ 2 =1,104±251 ns) were much longer than the spin-coated film (that is,
τ ref1 =41±1 ns and
τ ref2 =268±28 ns), indicating a lower trap density within the MASP film. Particularly, the longer lifetime
τ 2
of the MASP film exceeded 1,000 ns, signifying that the trap-induced carrier recombination was appreciably reduced due to the formation of high-quality and large-sized FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite grains by MASP 48 . The charge trap densities within the perovskite films were actually measured from the space charge-limited current (SCLC) devices ( Supplementary Method 4 ) 46 . The charge trap density within the MASP film was estimated to be
∼ 5.74 × 10 12  cm −3
( Fig. 3d ), which was much lower than that of the spin-coated film (that is,
∼ 4.04 × 10 15  cm −3 ;
Supplementary Fig. 18 ), in good agreement with the UV–Vis and PL spectroscopy studies. Taken together, the results noted above substantiate that the MASP method enable the formation of FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite film with good crystallization and low charge traps, offering the remarkable potential to yield high-performance optoelectronic devices. Figure 3: Optoelectronic properties of FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45

Full size image We thus fabricate FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite solar cells via MASP, which allows for direct deposition of a perovskite photoactive layer on the top of the functional electrodes. The effect of perovskite film thickness on the photovoltaic performance is investigated. The film thickness of the MASP perovskite film is varied by adjusting the ink concentration ( Supplementary Fig. 5b ). The corresponding photovoltaic efficiency with the device architecture of FTO/compact-TiO 2 /Perovskite/PTAA/Ag is studied.
Supplementary Fig. 19
compares the current density–voltage ( J – V ) curves of the devices with the perovskite film thickness ranging from
∼ 600 nm to
∼ 1,400 nm. The photovoltaic parameters are summarized in
Supplementary Table 1 . When the film thickness was increased from 620 to 890 nm, the
J sc
and
FF
were increased, resulting in the increase in
PCE
from 15.73 to 18.27%. When the film thickness was further increased to 1,070 nm, the
FF
tended to decrease. Notably, all photovoltaic parameters decreased when the film thickness reached 1,410 nm, probably due to the increased series resistance and charge recombination in the thick film. Thus, the optimal film thickness was fixed at
∼ 900 nm in this work. In this context, the inverted planar solar cells with the device architecture of ITO/PTAA/Perovskite/PCBM/BCP/Ag produced an average PCE of 18.49±0.47% ( Supplementary Table 2 ). The champion cell achieved a PCE of 19.23% with an open-circuit voltage
V oc
of 1.10 V, short-circuit current
J sc
of 22.34 mA cm −2 , and fill factor FF of 78.26% ( Fig. 4a ). A stable output photocurrent density of 20.6 mA cm −2
and PCE of 19.1% of this champion cell were obtained under the standard sunlight ( Fig. 4c ). Compared to inverted planar devices, higher PCEs were achieved in the standard planar devices with the architecture of FTO/compact-TiO 2 /Perovskite/PTAA/Ag, in which the average PCE was 19.22±0.36% ( Supplementary Table 3 ). The champion cell delivered a
V oc
of 1.10 V,
J sc
of 23.20 mA cm −2 , FF of 78.58% and a PCE of 20.05% ( Fig. 4b ). Similarly, the stable output photocurrent density and PCE of the champion cell reached 21.5 mA cm −2
and 19.9% ( Fig. 4d ). The integrated current densities from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were 21.94 and 22.38 mA cm −2
for champion inverted and standard planar devices ( Supplementary Fig. 20 ), respectively, which agreed well with the measured
J sc
values. Compared with those of spin-coated perovskite films ( Supplementary Tables 4 and 5 ), the MASP-enabled standard and inverted planar perovskite solar cells displayed not only high efficiencies with inappreciable hysteresis ( Supplementary Fig. 21 ) but also small s.d. in the average PCEs. This can be attributed to the presence of large-sized, highly-crystallized and preferentially-oriented perovskite grains created by MASP.

Full size image Discussion The stability of FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite solar cells with the device architecture of FTO/compact-TiO 2 /Perovskite/PTAA/Ag fabricated by MASP and spin coating, respectively, is also investigated. The devices are continuously exposed to AM1.5G solar illumination in ambient environment (temperature=25±2 °C and relative humidity=30±8%) without encapsulation. The photovoltaic efficiency is measured at an interval of 12 h.
Figure 5
compares the photovoltaic parameters as a function of time for both MASP-deposited and spin-coated devices (the
J – V
curves were shown in
Supplementary Fig. 22 ). The spin-coated device started to experience the efficiency drop after 12-h continuous illumination and lost 50% of its initial efficiency in 60 h. In contrast, the MASP-deposited device maintained nearly 90% of its initial efficiency after 60-h continuous illumination in air. The efficiency was then rapidly decreased after 84 h and reached 35% of its initial efficiency in 108 h. The enhanced stability of perovskite films prepared by MASP can be ascribed to the incorporation of FA +
and Br -
components which are beneficial for improving the perovskite stability 31 , as the unsealed CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
perovskite solar cells usually lose 70% of their initial efficiencies within 48 h under continuous illumination in air 49 , 50 . Moreover, it is also highly correlated with the high-quality large perovskite grains produced by MASP which are more resistant to light- and moisture-induced degradation. Our ongoing work on further improving the device stability involves the incorporation of Cs +
in the perovskite composition 51
and the encapsulation of devices to isolate them from moisture and UV light. These results will be reported elsewhere in the future. Figure 5: Device stability under continuous working condition. Stability plots of ( a ) PCE, ( b )

J sc
and ( d ) FF as a function of time (left axis). The normalized values are also included for better comparisons (right axis). The device stability was measured under continuous AM1.5G solar illumination in ambient environment without encapsulation. Full size image We also explore the manufacturing of large-area perovskite solar cells by MASP. The large-area device is fabricated with the architecture of FTO/compact-TiO 2 /perovskite/PTAA/Ag and the active-layer area of 1.00±0.02 cm 2 . A showdow mask with the aperture area of 0.980 cm 2
is used to measure the
J – V
curves. The highest PCE of 18.02% in a backward scanning was obtained ( Supplementary Fig. 23 ). The hysteresis phenomenon was obvious compared to the standard-area devices (that is, photoactive area=0.10 cm 2 ). However, it is notable that the MASP process is more complicated for depositing large-area perovskite films, as the crystallization rate tends to change and become unstable at the late printing stage. Such instability is likely to be caued by the change of the mensicus shape during the MASP process as the perovskite ink is consumed. Thus, the MASP apparatus will need to be modified to enable a continuous supply of perovksite ink for maintaining the meniscus shape for large-area printing. Moreover, the deposition of uniform electron-transport layer and hole-trasnport layer by MASP over large areas is also important in further improving the device efficiency. In summary, we develop a robust and convenient MASP strategy to effectively deposit large-grained dense FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite films with enhanced optoelectronic properties for high-efficiency perovskite solar cells. Central to this strategy is the solvent evaporation-triggered outward convective flow that transported the perovskite solutes to the edge of the meniscus, promoting the formation of solution-printed micrometre-scale perovskite grains with preferred crystal orientations at low temperatures. The insight into the crystal growth kinetics of FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite is revealed through the real-time optical microscopy study, from which a two-stage, namely, quadratical followed by linear growth of perovskite crystallization is identified. High photovoltaic PCEs approaching 20% are achieved in planar FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite solar cells, which can be ascribed to low trap-state density and long carrier lifetimes in large-grained perovskite films crafted by MASP. As the optoelectronic properties of perovskite films are closely related to film quality, the ability of the MASP strategy to yield dense and uniform films may open up new avenues for low-cost production of large-area flexible solution-printed perovskite-based materials and devices. Methods Materials Formamidinium iodide (H 2 N=CHNH 2 I; FAI) and methylammonium bromide (CH 3 NH 3 Br; MABr) were synthesized according to the reported methods 31 , and dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C for 48 h. Lead iodide (PbI 2 , 99.999%), lead bromide (PbBr 2 , 99.999%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, ≥99.9%) and other materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Meniscus-assisted solution printing of perovskite films The perovskite precursor ink was prepared by dissolving FAI, MABr, PbI 2
and PbBr 2
(molar ratio of FAI:MABr:PbI 2 :PbBr 2= 0.85:0.15:2.55:0.45) in DMSO, and stirred at 60 °C for 2 h to form 0.25 M FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
precursor ink. A 20 μl of the ink solution was loaded in a confined geometry composed of two nearly parallel plates (an upper stationary plate of 0.5 cm × 1 cm and a lower movable substrate of 1.5 cm × 2.5 cm; the separation distance between these two plates was 300 μm). The lower flat substrate was mounted on a computer-programed translational stage (Parker Hannifin Corp, Mode MX80LVixBL2b) with a resolution of 100 nm. The lower substrate was heated at
∼ 60 °C on a Linkam Scientific Precision Temperature Controlled Microscope Stage (Linkam TMS 94 LTS 350) to expedite the evaporation of DMSO. The lower flat substrate placed on the translational stage was moved at a speed of 12 μm s −1
in the direction opposite to the receding meniscus. Thus, the evaporative front progressively swept across the entire substrate to print a continuous large-grained perovskite film. Spin coating of perovskite films The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving FAI, MABr, PbI 2
and PbBr 2
(molar ratio of FAI:MABr:PbI 2 :PbBr 2 =0.85:0.15:2.55:0.45) in DMSO. The solution concentration was 1.2 M. The precursor solution was maintained at 90 °C. It was then spin coated on a pre-heated substrate at 1,000 r.p.m. for 5 s and 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s, followed by thermal annealing at 150 °C for 20 min to form the perovskite film. Fabrication of standard planar perovskite solar cells The FTO glass substrate was treated by oxygen plasma for 10 min, followed by spin coating 0.15 M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution at 2,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. The titanium-containing precursor film was dried at 125 °C for 10 min and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. The resulting TiO 2
layer was then immersed in 20 mM TiCl 4
solution at 65 °C for 20 min, followed by sintering at 550 °C for 30 min to produce a compact TiO 2
layer on the FTO glass substrate. FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite film was then deposited on the compact-TiO 2 /FTO substrate by MASP in ambient air at
∼ 30% relative humidity. 2 ml poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine) (PTAA) toluene solution (25 mg ml −1 ) was mixed with 29 μl Li-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI)/acetonitrile (170 mg ml −1 ) and 20 μl 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP). The resulting PTAA solution was spin coated on the perovskite layer at 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. Finally, a 200-nm silver layer was thermally evaporated on the PTAA layer. Fabrication of inverted planar perovskite solar cells 10 mg ml −1
PTAA toluene solution containing the additives of Li-TFSI and TBP was spin coated on the FTO glass substrate at 2,000 r.p.m. for 60 s, followed by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 5 min. FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite film was then deposited on the PTAA/FTO substrate by MASP. 50 mg ml −1
[6,6]-Phenyl C 61
butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution was spin coated on the perovskite layer at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s, followed by storing in a covered Petri dish for 6 h. Finally, a 5-nm bathocuproine (BCP) layer and a 200-nm silver layer were sequentially deposited by thermal evaporation. Fabrication of space charge limited current devices The FTO glass substrate was treated by oxygen plasma for 10 min, followed by thermally depositing a 500-nm indium layer. FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite film was deposited on the indium/FTO substrate by MASP. Another 500-nm indium layer was then thermally deposited on the perovskite layer. Fabrication of reference devices For comparison, all reference devices (that is, standard and inverted planar perovskite solar cells) were fabricated in similar ways, except that the perovskite films were prepared by spin coating. Characterizations The film morphology and elemental mapping of perovskite films were characterized using a LEO 1550 scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) was performed on a JEOL 100CX transmission electron microscopy (TEM). X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles were collected by a PANalytical X’Pert PRO X-ray diffractometer using Cu K α 1
radiation ( λ =1.541 Å) operating at 40 kV and 40 mA. UV-Vis spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu UV2600 spectrophotometer with a photometric integrating sphere. Fluorescence spectra were recorded using a PerkinElmer LS 45 Fluorescence Spectrometer. The
in situ
optical microscopy studies were conducted using a Leica DFC450 C digital microscope camera equipped with a 5 Megapixel CCD sensor. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements were performed using a Photon Technology International (PTI) LaserStrobe spectrofluorometer equipped with a PTI GL-3300 nanosecond nitrogen laser ( λ =337 nm) operating at 11 Hz. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured by Thermo K-Alpha XPS system. Perovskite solar cells were tested under AM1.5G irradiation using a Newport LCS-100 Solar Simulator (100 mW cm −2 , calibrated with a Newport 91150V Reference Cell System). The current density–voltage ( J – V ) curves were measured using a Keithley 2601A multisource meter. No preconditioning protocol was used before the characterization. The
J – V
curves were measured in air (that is, temperature: 25±2 °C, relative humidity: 30±8 %) without encapsulation. The
J – V
curves were scanned in the forward direction unless specified, and were processed at the rate of 50 mV s −1
with a sweep delay time of 50 ms. For standard-area solar cells, the active-layer area was 0.10±0.02 cm 2 , and a shadow mask with an aperture area of 0.096 cm 2
was used to define the measured area. For large-area solar cells, the active-layer area was 1.00±0.02 cm 2
and the aperture area of the shadow mask was 0.980 cm 2 . The device stability with the active-layer area of 0.10±0.02 cm 2
and the aperture area of 0.096 cm 2
was measured under continuous AM1.5G solar illumination in ambient environment (that is, temperature=25±2 °C and relative humidity=30±8%) without encapsulation. The photovoltaic efficiency was measured in an interval of 12 h. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement was performed using a Newport Quantum Efficiency Measurement Kit.

Abstract Perovskite materials use earth-abundant elements, have low formation energies for deposition and are compatible with roll-to-roll and other high-volume manufacturing techniques. These features make perovskite solar cells (PSCs) suitable for terawatt-scale energy production with low production costs and low capital expenditure. Demonstrations of performance comparable to that of other thin-film photovoltaics (PVs) and improvements in laboratory-scale cell stability have recently made scale up of this PV technology an intense area of research focus. Here, we review recent progress and challenges in scaling up PSCs and related efforts to enable the terawatt-scale manufacturing and deployment of this PV technology. We discuss common device and module architectures, scalable deposition methods and progress in the scalable deposition of perovskite and charge-transport layers. We also provide an overview of device and module stability, module-level characterization techniques and techno-economic analyses of perovskite PV modules.

Introduction Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites have emerged as a revolutionary class of light-harvesting materials. The general perovskite formula is ABX 3 , in which A is a monovalent cation (such as methylammonium (MA + ), formamidinium (FA + ) or caesium (Cs + )), B is a divalent metallic cation (such as Pb 2+
or Sn 2+ ) and X is a halide (I − , Br −
or Cl − ). After only several years of active research, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has substantially increased to more than 22% 1 – 4 . Remarkably, this high performance was achieved with a device that was fabricated through solution processing, which has not been demonstrated for other photovoltaic (PV) technologies. This makes PSCs promising candidates for a high-performance, low-cost PV technology. Several intrinsic material properties contribute to the demonstrated high efficiency of this new PV technology, such as high absorption coefficients, long carrier diffusion lengths, flexible bandgap tuning and defect tolerance 5 – 10 . However, for practical application, PV technologies need to be more than efficient — they also need to be stable and scalable. During the past few years, we have seen remarkable progress towards future large-scale PSC manufacturing using scalable deposition. There has been a rapid improvement in the efficiency of PSCs at different size scales ( Fig. 1a ) — namely, small-area cells ( ∼ 0.1 cm 2 ), large-area cells ( ∼ 1 cm 2 ) and modules (>10 cm 2 ). The surge in performance of small-area devices is largely ascribed to the improved composition and morphology of perovskite thin films owing to innovations in solution chemistry and the fabrication process. These developments have been readily transferred to large-area devices, resulting in an increase in efficiency that has closely followed the trend of small-device development. By contrast, the efficiencies of PSC modules notably lag behind those of single-cell devices. Figure 1: Efficiency of perovskite solar cells. a

Full size image A loss in efficiency is inevitable when the solar cell or module area increases. This loss is the result of a combination of several factors, including higher series resistance, lower shunt resistance, non-uniform coating over a large area and the unavoidable dead (that is, inactive) area of bus bars and interconnections.
Figure 1b
shows the correlation between the state-of-the-art PCE and the solar cell or module area for different types of solar cells: silicon, cadmium telluride (CdTe), copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), organic PV (OPV) and a PSC. The different types of solar cells (except for the PSC) all follow an apparent inverse scaling law, with the absolute PCE value decreasing by about 0.8% when the device area increases by an order of magnitude. The current status of PSC modules falls below this predicted trend: there is a greater decrease in efficiency when the PSC area increases compared with other types of solar cells. This disparity in efficiency undoubtedly results from the minimal research efforts on the scaling of PSCs. Challenges in scaling up PSCs include developing scalable deposition strategies for the uniform coating of all device layers over large-area substrates, including the perovskite photoactive layer, electron-transport layer (ETL), hole-transport layer (HTL) and electrodes; achieving better control of film formation across the device stack at large scales by improving the precursor chemistry to better match the processing methods; and developing procedures for fabricating and integrating perovskite modules, as well as understanding the impact of device architecture on the performance of the module interconnections and the reliability and stability of module operation. Despite numerous challenges, the progress made towards scaling up PSCs is impressive. Small-area laboratory devices fabricated by scalable deposition (for example, by blade coating) have already reached PCE levels close to those fabricated by spin coating 11 – 13 . Although the PCE of perovskite modules still lags behind that of smaller devices, the rate of increase in the PCE of perovskite modules is unprecedented compared with other PV technologies 14
( Fig. 1a ). A perovskite module with a certified PCE of 16% and an area >16 cm 2
has recently been demonstrated 15 . In this Review, we focus on the key considerations for scaling PSCs and on the challenges for transitioning from the laboratory scale to the factory scale. We summarize common PSC and module architectures and then discuss efficiency losses that occur on moving from cells to modules as well as the importance of module design for achieving efficiency and stability. We compare various scalable deposition methods, including both solution-phase and vapour-phase depositions, their advantages and limitations with respect to PSC processing and the current status of the corresponding efforts to scale up PSCs. We provide an overview of recent progress in solution chemistry and processing control towards the scalable deposition of perovskite and charge-transport layers along with characterization techniques suitable for large-area perovskite absorber layers and module structures. Advances in the fabrication and characterization of large-area devices have greatly contributed to recent progress in scaling. Stability and cost are important issues to be addressed before PSCs can be commercialized. We discuss the strategies for improving the stability of PSCs and potential reliability issues facing PSC modules. Additionally, current reports on manufacturing cost analyses and life cycle assessments based on common PSC or module structures are summarized. Finally, we provide an outlook on the challenges associated with PSC scaling, with a focus on the scalability of processes and materials. Device architectures Perovskite solar cell architectures The most common device architectures for PSCs can be categorized into three types: mesoporous n–i–p, planar n–i–p and planar p–i–n ( Fig. 2a ).

Full size image The mesoporous n–i–p architecture was the first device architecture to be developed and has evolved notably from the early days of PSC research. A typical mesoporous PSC comprises an ETL scaffold with nanoscale pores. A perovskite absorber layer covers the scaffold, forming a compact capping layer and also penetrating into the scaffold, leading to an intermixed layer. The HTL and the top electrode are then sequentially deposited on the perovskite layer to complete the device stack. The mesoporous layer can facilitate charge separation and help suppress the notorious photocurrent–voltage ( J – V ) hysteresis phenomenon in PSCs 16 . A record PCE of 22.1% has been attained with a mesoporous structure 3 . The planar n–i–p architecture contains a compact ETL layer and thus does not feature the perovskite–ETL intermixed layer that is present in the mesoporous architecture. Although the planar structure is more prone to exhibiting
J – V
hysteresis, recent optimization of the ETL/perovskite interface has given rise to high-performance planar PSCs that show little hysteresis 17 – 21 . In this context, the mesoporous layer adds one more step to the fabrication process, which is perhaps unfavourable for scaling. It remains to be seen if the mesoporous scaffold is indispensable for achieving higher PCE or improved stability. It is worth noting that for certain n–i–p device architectures, the HTL layer can be eliminated by using carbon or gold electrodes 22 – 24 . The planar p–i–n architecture is generally referred to as an inverted structure because the carrier extraction layers are inverted with respect to the n–i–p structure. Devices with a p–i–n architecture are often constructed with a planar structure with a compact HTL. Perovskite solar modules As with other thin-film PV technologies, it is not practical to fabricate a single PSC on a large-area substrate because the parasitic resistance loss in the transparent conducting electrode is substantial over a long transport distance. Resistance losses can be managed by dividing a large cell into smaller sub-cells with series interconnections to form a module 25
( Fig. 2b ). The series interconnections sum the voltage available from the module. The interconnections occupy
∼ 3–10% of the module area, depending on the geometry of the interconnection layout. The interconnection area is inactive for power generation and thus is a major source of power loss in PV modules. The ratio between the photoactive area and the total area of a module is defined as the geometric fill factor (GFF) of the module. Modules with a higher GFF can generate more power for a given module size. Thus, a well-accepted practice for reporting module efficiency for conventional PV materials is to report the efficiency of a designated illumination area (or aperture area) that should include all interconnections 26
( Fig. 2c ). However, some perovskite module efficiencies are reported as the efficiencies limited to the active area, which excludes the area of the interconnections. In such cases, it is important to also report the GFF so that results can be accurately compared. For example, a module with an active-area efficiency of 15% and a GFF of 80% has an aperture efficiency of 12%. Thin-film PV modules (for example, CdTe and CIGS) are generally fabricated by first depositing the thin-film materials on one substrate and then separating individual cells by laser or mechanical scribing. There are three separation processes involved in module fabrication ( Fig. 2b ). In the first step, the bottom conducting electrode (for example, transparent conductive oxide (TCO)) is divided into parts to form isolated substrates for the individual sub-cells; in the second step, some of the active material (ETL, perovskite and HTL) is removed to construct interconnections between the sub-cells; and in the final step, the top electrodes and the edge of the module are isolated to separate the individual sub-cells and to define the outer boundaries of the module. PSCs can be processed into modules with a similar fabrication scheme. Scribing with lasers is highly desirable for industrial production, with the advantages of low cost, fast production rate and high GFF, which is associated with high precision and fine resolution. Perovskite modules fabricated through all-laser scribing have demonstrated a GFF of 94% 25 . However, perovskite materials are typically more thermally sensitive than other thin-film solar cell materials. Thus, one possible drawback of laser scribing is the potential for degradation and/or redeposition of materials near the scribe. Optimizing the sub-cell separation and module interconnection procedures for perovskite modules is important for scaling up PSCs and needs to be researched further. Another fabrication scheme for module assembly is to deposit each layer only at desired areas, thus requiring no additional scribing to form the interconnections. Such on-demand deposition can be realized through patterned printing and deposition with masks. However, patterned deposition requires pattern alignment for each layer to be deposited, and the spatial resolution is typically lower than with laser scribing. Thus, modules fabricated with this method normally exhibit a lower GFF and larger dead-area power loss. Scalable deposition methods To deposit perovskite films through solution processing, organic halides and lead halides are first dissolved in organic solvents such as
N , N -dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and γ-butyrolactone (GBL). These perovskite precursor solutions are used in both spin coating and scalable deposition methods. Spin coating is the most common method for perovskite thin-film deposition. However, it is generally limited to a scale of <10 cm, and a large portion (>90%) of the precursor ink is wasted in the process. Modules can be fabricated by spin coating on a substrate area of up to about 10 cm × 10 cm but with a considerably lower PCE than their smaller-area counterparts 27 . In spin coating, thinning and smoothing of the wet-solution films rely on the continuous centrifugal force from spinning, which is difficult to replicate in scalable deposition processes. Thus, the solution chemistry and processing conditions developed for spin coating cannot be easily applied in other scalable deposition methods. Furthering our understanding of the factors that affect thin-film formation and increasing our control of thin-film formation in different deposition processes are crucial for scaling up PSCs. Scalable solution deposition methods Scalable solution deposition methods for perovskite growth include, but are not limited to, blade coating, slot-die coating, meniscus coating, spray coating, inkjet printing, screen printing and electrodeposition. Here, we briefly compare these deposition methods as well as their use for PSC cell and module development. Blade coating . In the blade-coating deposition method, a blade is used to spread precursor solution on substrates to form wet thin films ( Fig. 3a ). The film thickness is generally controlled by several factors, including the concentration of the precursor ink, the gap between the blade and substrate, and the speed at which the blade moves across the substrate. This technique can be adapted for continuous fabrication with roll-to-roll setups, in which the blade is stationary and flexible substrates on a roller are in motion. The ink waste is substantially reduced compared with spin coating, especially in continuous roll-to-roll deposition. PSCs fabricated by blade coating have demonstrated PCEs >19% 11 , 12 . Figure 3: Common scalable solution deposition methods for the roll-to-roll fabrication of perovskite solar cells. Scalable methods for perovskite deposition include blade coating (panel

Full size image Slot-die coating . Slot-die coating ( Fig. 3b ) is similar to blade coating and uses an ink reservoir with a thin slit to apply ink over the substrate. Ink flow can be better controlled in slot-die coating, but this method normally requires larger quantities of ink to fill the ink reservoir and supply pipe and thus is generally less suitable for use in the development of new ink chemistries. As a result, slot-die coating has been less explored, and at present, the resultant PSCs have a much lower PCE than those fabricated through blade coating. However, slot-die coating shows better yield and reproducibility than blade coating when the ink is already fully developed. Thus, it has more potential to be applied in roll-to-roll fabrication in the future. It is noteworthy that both blade and slot-die coating use a moving meniscus liquid edge of precursor ink to spread the liquid film across the substrate. Some other non-conventional methods to create the meniscus edge are pulling a substrate out of a precursor ink (for example, dip coating) 28
and sheering a cover plate over the deposition substrate 29 . A recently reported soft-cover coating method also uses a meniscus edge for perovskite deposition. Before coating, a soft polymer sheet covers the coating substrate and traps the precursor ink between the layers. The meniscus liquid edge is formed and then moved as the polymer sheet is gradually peeled off. Uniform perovskite thin films of up to 51 cm 2
have been deposited using this soft-cover method 30 . Spray coating . In spray coating, a nozzle is used to disperse tiny liquid droplets onto substrates ( Fig. 3c ). Spray coating can be further classified according to the method used for generating droplets, such as pneumatic spraying (through fast gas flow), ultrasonic spraying (through ultrasonic vibration) or electrospraying (through electrical repulsion). Pneumatic spraying and ultrasonic spraying are commonly used for compact oxide layer deposition in PSCs. The perovskite layer can also be deposited by ultrasonic spraying 31 – 35 . Droplet size and placement are random in the spraying process, and several droplets need to overlap in a local area to ensure full coverage. Furthermore, new droplets can dissolve the already deposited materials, adding to the processing complexity. Keeping the substrate at an elevated temperature during spraying increases the rate of solvent evaporation and suppresses the redissolution of deposited material. The balance between solvent removal and material redissolution can be controlled by carefully tuning the solvent ratio and substrate temperature 34 . Electrospraying applies a high voltage between the spray nozzle and substrate. The droplets are smaller with electrical repulsion, and the electric field also increases the impact velocity of the droplets and the extent to which the droplets spread on substrates 36 . Inkjet printing . In inkjet printing, nozzles are used to disperse the precursor ink, with fine control of the droplet size and trajectory ( Fig. 3d ). Miniaturized nozzles and a short distance between the nozzles and substrate enable ultrafine lateral resolution, as demonstrated in digital printers. This patterning ability is suitable for printing electronics. Small-area PSCs (0.04 cm 2 ) have been fabricated using inkjet printing 37 . However, whether inkjet printing is suitable for the high-volume, large-area production of perovskite solar modules will depend on the printing speed and device structure. Screen printing . In screen printing, a patterned mesh screen is used to hold and transfer ink to the substrate ( Fig. 3e ). This method has good patterning ability with a lateral resolution of
∼ 75–100 μm (Ref.
38 ). The unwanted area of the mesh screen is blocked by the exposed photosensitive polymer emulsion, and the open holes of the mesh hold the viscous ink as a squeegee spreads ink across the screen. The ink is then transferred to the substrate to form the desired pattern. The thickness of the resulting film is determined by the mesh size and thickness of the emulsion layer. Screen printing is usually used to deposit thicker films ( ∼ 1–10 μm), and it has been used to fabricate mesoporous scaffolds and carbon back electrodes in PSCs 22 , 39 . Electrodeposition . Electrodeposition is another scalable solution deposition method to deposit thin films over a large area. There are no reports of the direct deposition of halide perovskites using electrodeposition, and it generally takes two steps to deposit perovskite thin films by electrodeposition. First, PbO 2
or PbO is electrodeposited on a conducting substrate. The lead oxide is then converted into a perovskite through reaction with organic halides 40
or reaction with HI acid to form PbI 2 , which is then converted into a perovskite 41 – 44 . The advantage of electrodeposition is the use of a non-toxic solvent (usually an aqueous solution) in the process. Table 1
summarizes different scalable deposition methods for preparing large-area perovskite thin films and their status in depositing charge-transport layers. Their roll-to-roll and patterning capabilities are also compared, together with the current state-of-the-art device performance for both single cells (aperture area ≤1 cm 2 ) and modules (aperture area ≥10 cm 2 ). Note that the certified record efficiency for a perovskite module (16.0%) is not listed here because the deposition method is not disclosed in the report 15 . A continuous fabrication line of PSCs may use multiple deposition techniques integrated together. Other deposition techniques have also been demonstrated for perovskite deposition, such as brush coating 45 , dip coating 28 , 46
and air-knife-assisted coating 47 . Table 1 Comparison of scalable solution processing methods for perovskite solar cells Full size table Vapour-phase deposition Vapour-phase deposition is common in solar cell fabrication: the deposition of CIGS and CdTe relies heavily on physical vapour deposition (PVD), and the doping of silicon is realized through chemical vapour deposition (CVD). A PVD apparatus for the large-scale fabrication of solar cells has been developed and successfully applied, and this experience and equipment have been readily translated to PSC fabrication. Perovskite thin films have been deposited with both PVD and CVD methods. PVD refers to the process in which a perovskite or its precursor is directly sublimated to form a perovskite thin film, whereas CVD refers to the process in which a lead halide is converted into a perovskite using organic halide vapours. The deposition of perovskite thin films using a PVD method was first demonstrated in 2013 (Ref.
48 ). Uniform and compact MAPbI 3 −
x Cl x
thin films were obtained by the co-evaporation of PbCl 2
and methylammonium iodide (MAI), enabling the construction of efficient planar PSCs. Ultrathin (50 nm) and large-area (5 cm × 5 cm) perovskite films, which are usually difficult to obtain by a solution method, were achieved using thermal evaporation 49 . In addition, PVD is a solvent-free method and largely independent of the substrate, making it attractive for the fabrication of perovskite–perovskite tandem devices. For example, an efficient MA 0.5 FA 0.5 Pb 0.75 Sn 0.25 I 3 /MAPbI 3
tandem device was fabricated by using solely thermal evaporation to directly deposit the MAPbI 3
sub-cell on the low-bandgap cell (MA 0.5 FA 0.5 Pb 0.75 Sn 0.25 I 3 ) 50 . The first CVD method developed for the deposition of perovskite materials involved the reaction of PbI 2
thin films with MAI vapour 51 . More CVD systems have been demonstrated with different chamber configurations and designs, environmental pressures, reaction temperatures and organic halide sources 52 – 54 . Towards the scaling of PSCs, CVD conversion has been used to deposit FAPbI 3
thin films on 5 cm × 5 cm substrates and to fabricate 12 cm 2
modules with a PCE of 9% 52 . Although vapour-phase deposition has the potential to be used to deposit perovskite thin films over large areas, these methods usually require more sophisticated vacuum equipment and longer processing times, which could potentially hinder their application for the low-cost fabrication of PSCs. Scaling up the absorber layer Nucleation and crystal-growth control The performance of PSCs depends greatly on the morphologies of the perovskite absorber layer. Scaling up PSCs requires coating perovskite thin films uniformly over large-area substrates without pinholes or other inhomogeneities. In an uncontrolled drying process, perovskite crystals tend to have preferential growth and form thin films with dendritic structures 55 , leading to poor surface coverage on the substrates and thus the formation of shunted paths in the solar cells. Strategies proposed to control nucleation and crystal growth to circumvent dendrite formation include physical approaches to promote supersaturation and chemical additives to control crystal growth ( Fig. 4 ). By applying these strategies, smooth and compact perovskite thin films that are suitable for large-area PSCs have been demonstrated. Figure 4: Strategies to control nucleation and film formation for scaling up perovskite absorber layers. a

Full size image Physical approaches to promote supersaturation . Rapid solvent removal from perovskite precursor solutions increases the supersaturation, leading to more nucleation and shorter grain growth times. A shorter growth time reduces the migration of the solute in the solution. Coupled with more nuclei, a shorter growth time suppresses the overgrowth of individual nuclei to form large dendritic structures. The rapid removal of solvent can be realized by anti-solvent extraction 16 , 56 , 57 , heating 46 , 58 , 59 , forced gas flow 47 , 60 , 61 , vacuum-assisted drying 62 – 64
or a combination of these physical approaches 65
( Fig. 4a ). Anti-solvent extraction is commonly used to achieve smooth, compact perovskite thin films. The anti-solvents need to be miscible with the solvents used to dissolve the perovskite precursors, but the perovskite itself should not be soluble in the anti-solvent. Using anti-solvents to extract solvents from the precursor solutions can lead to rapid supersaturation of the perovskite precursor film and fast precipitation of the perovskite materials. Examples of anti-solvents include toluene 16 , chlorobenzene 56 , ethyl ether 57 , ethyl acetate 66 , hexane 67
and anisole 68 . Anti-solvent extraction has been combined with spin-coating deposition by dripping the anti-solvent onto a spinning substrate covered with a perovskite precursor solution 16 . However, dripping anti-solvent during spin coating produces complex dynamics across the substrate, and more uniform results can be achieved by spraying the anti-solvent 69 . Anti-solvent spraying was used to fabricate a 16 cm 2
perovskite single cell with a PCE of 12.1% 70 . However, anti-solvent dripping and spraying have been deployed only with spin coating, and they are difficult to implement in scalable deposition. To address this challenge, anti-solvent bathing has been developed, in which the precursor film is soaked in a bath of anti-solvent for a short period of time 57 . In principle, anti-solvent bathing places no limit on the substrate size and could be incorporated in roll-to-roll continuous fabrication. Heating can also expedite solvent removal in the solution processing of perovskite thin films. For example, a hot-casting technique has been used to deposit perovskite films 58 . In this hot-casting process, a hot perovskite precursor solution (70 °C) was spin-coated on hot substrates (180 °C), forcing the solvents to rapidly evaporate. Because heating the substrate during large-area deposition is rather easy, this heating approach has been used to control the perovskite film morphology in blade coating, spray coating, dip coating and soft-cover coating 12 , 28 , 30 , 31 , 34 , 59 , 71 , 72 . For example, a pinhole-free perovskite thin film was obtained by heating the substrate close to the boiling point of the perovskite precursor solvent during blade coating 59 . Moreover, a hot dip-coating technique has been developed, in which hot substrates were dipped into a perovskite precursor solution and then drawn out, forming perovskite thin films in 2 s (Ref.
46 ). Forced gas flow and vacuum-assisted drying have also been used for rapid solvent removal. A forced gas flow was first used to induce fast crystallization during spin coating 60 . This concept was later adapted for slot-die coating, using an air blade to assist solvent drying 61 . A vacuum flash-drying method that uses a vacuum to extract solvent has also been reported. With the vacuum-assisted drying technique, large-area PSCs (>1 cm 2 ) with PCEs >20% were achieved 62 . In a further development, an apparatus was designed to simultaneously apply a low pressure and strong gas flow over the wet substrate; the combined effect of the gas flow and vacuum increased the solvent removal rate 65 . Recently, solvent systems with ultrafast evaporation rates have been reported for perovskite deposition. Methylamine (CH 3 NH 2 ) gas can considerably increase the solubility of MAI and PbI 2
in solvents by forming MAI– m CH 3 NH 2
( m
≤ 3) and PbX 2 – n CH 3 NH 2
( n
≤ 1) complexes 13 . Assisted by methylamine gas, perovskite precursors can be dissolved in normally poor perovskite solvents, such as acetonitrile. For example, in one study, methylamine gas was dissolved in acetonitrile, and this combined system was then used to dissolve a perovskite. The solvent evaporated quickly during spin coating of the perovskite precursor solution, facilitating fast crystallization of the perovskite at room temperature with an initial device reaching a PCE >18% 73 . Although this solvent system has so far been used only in spin coating, it should be applicable to large-scale deposition techniques, such as blade or slot-die coating. With an excess of methylamine gas, the MAPbI 3 –CH 3 NH 2
complex is liquid under ambient conditions 74 . The MAPbI 3 –CH 3 NH 2
liquid can be processed through solution methods and, as the excess methylamine can be rapidly removed, results in fast crystallization of the perovskite. This approach can be used to fabricate large-area devices; for example, a soft cover under high pressure was used to spread MAPbI 3 –CH 3 NH 2
liquid and to attain a uniform MAPbI 3
film over a large substrate (8 cm × 8 cm). A perovskite module fabricated with this method reached a certified aperture PCE of 12.1% ( ∼ 90% GFF) 13 . Chemical additives to control crystal growth . Nucleation and crystal growth are also strongly influenced by the chemistry of the perovskite precursors. The morphology of perovskite thin films can be tuned by varying the chemical composition or by introducing additives to the precursor solution ( Fig. 4b ). For example, perovskite thin films derived from a chloride-containing precursor (PbCl 2
+ 3MAI) showed better coverage and had a larger grain size than those obtained from a stoichiometric precursor (PbI 2
+ MAI) 75 . Other chloride additives (for example, MACl or NH 4 Cl) can also be used to prepare chloride-containing perovskite precursors, generating thin films with a morphology similar to those obtained with PbCl 2
(Refs
76 – 78 ). It is generally believed that Cl −
competes with I −
to coordinate to Pb 2+ , suppressing the formation of Pb–I–Pb plumbates and nuclei in the solution 55 , 79 . Chloride-containing additives slow nucleation and crystal-growth processes but also induce the formation of a chloride-containing intermediate phase after the solvent is removed. The film with an intermediate phase is less crystalline than a perovskite film directly deposited from a stoichiometric precursor (PbI 2
+ MAI), but it is usually less rough, with no dendrites or pinholes. The film compactness is preserved when the intermediate phase is transformed into the perovskite through the subsequent chemical reaction 80 , 81 . Chloride-containing non-stoichiometric precursors are often used in the spray, blade and slot-die coating of perovskite thin films 34 , 61 , 82 – 84 . In addition to chloride additives, other organic halides and Pb(CH 3 CO 2 ) 2
can be used as additives to induce the formation of an intermediate phase for growing uniform perovskite films 85 , 86 . A general reaction scheme for the conversion of the intermediate phase to the perovskite (MAPbI 3 ) has been proposed:

> I −
(Ref.
87 ). Hydrohalic acids (HCl, HBr and HI) are also used as additives to produce smooth perovskite thin films without anti-solvent treatment 88 – 92 . A hydrohalic acid has two roles in tuning the growth kinetics: first, the acid provides excess anions to coordinate to Pb 2+ , leading to the formation of an intermediate film after the solvent is removed 88 , and second, the acid lowers the pH of the precursor solution and breaks down small clusters and nuclei, thus suppressing nucleation and crystal growth 93 . Lewis acid–base theory defines acceptors and donors of electron pairs as Lewis acids and bases, respectively 94 . Pb(ɪɪ) halides are strong Lewis acids that readily form adducts with Lewis-basic solvents or additives. The formation of Lewis acid–base adducts in the precursor solution increases the solubility of lead halides and slows nucleation and crystal growth. By varying the basicity of the Lewis base and thus the strength of the interaction with the lead halide, the nucleation and crystal growth rates can be tuned. This approach can be used to improve the morphology of perovskite thin films. For example, the addition of DMSO or thiourea to a precursor solution of PbI 2
and MAI in DMF led to the formation of a Lewis acid–base adduct, and the morphology of the resultant thin film was greatly improved compared with the thin film obtained from the precursor solution without the Lewis-basic additive 95 . Other examples of Lewis-basic additives with the ability to modify perovskite thin-film morphologies are
N -cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidone 96 , hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) 97 , 1,8-diiodooctane 98
and thiosemicarbazide 99 . These additives have been demonstrated to improve the morphology of perovskite thin films, which would be beneficial for perovskite deposition over large-area substrates using various scalable deposition methods. Surface modification of the substrates is another way to control the perovskite film morphology. Decreasing the surface energy of the substrate decreases the heterogeneous nucleation energy of the perovskite and promotes nucleation on the substrate surface, leading to films that are more compact. A thin layer of perylene was used to modify the surface of PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate) to improve the surface coverage of the resulting perovskite thin films 100 . Self-assembled monolayer (SAM) modification of the substrate surface improves wetting of the precursors on the substrates and thus improves the uniformity of the resulting perovskite thin films 101 , 102 . In another example, a surfactant, such as poly(vinylpyrrolidone), was added to the perovskite precursors to improve the surface coverage and smoothness of MAPbI 3 −
x Cl x
thin films 103 . By contrast, non-wetting substrates were found to increase the perovskite grain size owing to larger spacing between the nuclei and easier grain-boundary migration associated with suppressed heterogeneous nucleation and a lower surface dragging force from the non-wetting substrates 104 . Two-step versus one-step deposition Perovskite thin films have also been deposited through a two-step deposition route in which a lead halide thin film is first deposited and then converted to the perovskite by reaction with organic halide salts 105 . In comparison with the direct coating of a perovskite (for example, MAPbI 3 ) precursor, two-step deposition can be used to fabricate more compact films over larger areas; it is generally easier to deposit uniform PbI 2
thin films than perovskite thin films over a large area, and in the second step, the volume expansion that accompanies the conversion of PbI 2
to the perovskite fills any pinholes in the thin films. This advantage could alleviate the complications of morphology control in one-step deposition, especially with scalable deposition processes. The two-step approach has been widely used in the slot-die 106 , electrodeposition 41 , 44
and spray coating 107 – 110
of perovskites. Large-area ( ∼ 1 cm 2 ) PSCs with 13.1% efficiency have been fabricated by two-step spray deposition 107 . Another advantage of two-step deposition is the increased processing tolerance to a humid environment. Efficient PSCs can be fabricated in humid conditions using two-step methods 111 , 112 . The results indicate that small amounts of water in the organic halide solution can assist grain growth in perovskite thin films 113 . One disadvantage of the two-step deposition method is the long and variable reaction time required to convert the lead halide into the perovskite. In early work with two-step deposition, the lead halide films were usually soaked in an organic halide solution for >10 min, and mesoporous scaffolds were required to facilitate organic halide penetration for faster reaction between the lead halide and the organic halide salt 105 . Two-step reactions on planar devices either result in incomplete reaction or require longer reaction times. The long reaction time and indispensability of the mesoporous layer have limited our ability to scale two-step deposition. However, the addition of Lewis-basic additives can increase the rate of reaction between the lead halide film and the organic halide. For example, adduct formation between PbI 2
and DMSO increased the reaction rate of PbI 2
with FAI through an intramolecular exchange mechanism: DMSO in the PbI 2 –DMSO complex readily exchanges with FAI, enabling the fast incorporation of FAI and thus rapid conversion to the perovskite 114 . This approach was used to fabricate PSCs with a record certified PCE of 22.1% and a 1 cm 2
device with a PCE of 19.7% 3 . Use of a Lewis base (for example,
N -methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) 115 , 116 , HMPA 117 , pyridine 118
or tributylphosphate 119 ) has also been shown to promote rapid and complete conversion of PbI 2
to the perovskite. Adding MAI to PbI 2
precursors pre-expands the volume of PbI 2
and suppresses the subsequent volume expansion from PbI 2
to the perovskite while also facilitating the PbI 2 –perovskite conversion 120 . All these strategies reduce the PbI 2 –perovskite reaction barrier and shorten the reaction time in two-step deposition, which may be useful in scaling two-step deposition for PSCs. Expanding processing windows It is necessary to control the precursor processing window (that is, the time required for the wet precursor film to dry to form a solid-state film) of perovskite deposition to ensure reproducible and scalable PSC fabrication. When anti-solvent extraction is used to control the morphology of perovskite thin films, there is a strict time window in which compact perovskite films can be attained by applying the anti-solvent. It is therefore crucial to match the time window of anti-solvent application to the precursor processing window. Otherwise, the solvent will evaporate during deposition over large-area substrates, and the opportunity for conducting anti-solvent extraction could easily be missed. One approach to extending the time taken for solvent evaporation is to use carefully selected mixtures of solvents. For example, a mixed solvent of GBL and DMSO takes longer to evaporate than DMF from perovskite precursor solutions, owing to the adduct formation between DMSO and PbI 2
(Ref.
16 ) ( Fig. 5a ). An even wider time window was achieved using a mixture of NMP and DMF, with an exceptionally long evaporation time of up to
∼ 8 min. The development of solvent mixtures with ultra-long evaporation times enables anti-solvent bathing after blade coating on a large-area substrate (up to 20 cm 2 ). A small-area (0.12 cm 2
aperture) device with a stable PCE of 19.05% and a module (12.6 cm 2
aperture) of PSCs with a PCE of
∼ 12% have been fabricated with blade coating and anti-solvent bathing 11 . Several solvent properties need to be considered when designing new solution chemistry: the boiling point and vapour pressure determine the evaporation rate of the solution, and the viscosity and surface tension affect the spreading of the precursor solution on substrates, with lower values favouring better wetting. Figure 5: Expanding processing windows, pulsed-light annealing and post-growth treatments for the fabrication of perovskite thin films. a
| Expanding the precursor processing window is necessary for scaling up perovskite absorber layer deposition. The processing window is the time period in which compact perovskite films can be attained by applying the anti-solvent. Dendritic structures start to form after the processing window. Processing windows can be increased by using solvent mixtures that are slower to evaporate.

Full size image The annealing process Thermal annealing is normally required after perovskite film deposition to increase crystallinity and grain size and to remove defects. These annealing steps are normally conducted using hot-plates and require prolonged processing times and extensive thermal energy. Annealing a perovskite layer usually takes 5–120 min. A long annealing time could negatively affect the production rate or make roll-to-roll fabrication lines impractically long. Adjusting the precursor chemistry (for example, using a MACl additive) has led to a substantial decrease in the required annealing times — from >10 min to <1 min (Ref.
11 ). Irradiation can be used to directly heat target materials, thereby reducing the processing time and the influence of heat on the underlying substrates. Therefore, irradiative heating is favourable for the roll-to-roll manufacturing of PSCs. Near-IR radiation was used to anneal a MAPbI 3 −
x Cl x
perovskite absorber and reduced the processing time from 45 min to 2.5 s without a notable loss in PV performance 121 . The processing time was further reduced to only 1.5 ms using intensive photonic flash sintering generated by xenon flash bulbs. However, this initial demonstration of an ultrafast process resulted in non-uniform films and lower PV performance 122 . The current status of intense pulsed-light sintering or annealing ( Fig. 5b ) was examined in a recent review 123 . In another example, rapid thermal annealing by halogen lamp irradiation was used on FAPbI 3
perovskite layers. FAPbI 3
has better heat resistivity than MAPbI 3 , which leads to better device reproducibility when treated with rapid thermal annealing. The optimal annealing time using the rapid thermal annealing approach was 40 s at 170 °C, a substantial decrease from the 10 min required using conventional hot-plates 124 . Post-growth treatment Film uniformity and high surface coverage of perovskite thin films are crucial to the production yield of efficient perovskite modules. Even with myriad approaches of addressing morphology and uniformity issues, perovskite deposition is still fundamentally sensitive to the processing conditions. The variation of processing conditions over a large-area substrate typically results in decreased module performance owing to local pinholes and structural defects. Eliminating such defects is therefore a requisite for large-scale fabrication. Post-growth treatments ( Fig. 5c ) that improve the reproducibility of the process and increase the process tolerance may also be key to successfully scaling PSC fabrication. An Ostwald ripening effect to heal structural defects in perovskite thin films has been demonstrated. MAPbI 3
films were treated with a dilute MABr solution ( ∼ 2 mg ml −1 ), followed by brief annealing at 150 °C (Ref.
125 ). The ripening process removed pinholes and increased the grain size and crystallinity of the perovskite thin film. Coalescence of small grains into larger grains can also be induced by annealing perovskite films in the vapour of polar solvents or organic halides. A reported DMF vapour annealing method increased the grain size and improved the electronic properties and PV performance of perovskite thin films 126 . Other polar solvents (for example, water, alcohols and DMSO) have been used for solvent annealing 127 – 129 . MAI vapour was also found to similarly induce grain growth in MAPbI 3
films 130 . A methylamine gas treatment approach can also be used to heal morphological defects in MAPbI 3
thin films 74 . Methylamine interacts with the perovskite and forms a liquid-state MAPbI 3 –CH 3 NH 2
intermediate phase that spreads smoothly on substrates. The methylamine gas treatment method can transform a poor-quality MAPbI 3
thin film with pinholes and dendritic structures into a smooth and compact thin film. Moreover, it can improve the device reproducibility of PSCs and increase the tolerance of the process to poor initial film morphology 131 . The microscopic structure of perovskite thin films can also be transformed with a pyridine (Py) gas treatment. Pyridine interacts reversibly with PbI 2
by forming a PbI 2 · x Py Lewis acid–base adduct, and the pyridine vapour recrystallizes the thin film when it is inserted and subsequently extracted from the perovskite lattice 132 . Scaling up the charge-transport layers Scalable deposition of the charge-transport layers (ETL and HTL) and the back electrode are also crucial to scaling up PSCs. The charge-transport layers should have appropriate interfacial energy alignment for charge transfer with the specific perovskite material and a suitable thickness and conductivity. Both inorganic and organic charge-transport materials have been used in PSCs. Common ETL materials in n–i–p PSCs include TiO 2 , SnO 2
and ZnO, as well as some doped oxides 133 – 135 . HTL materials in n–i–p PSCs are more diverse and include organic small molecules (for example, spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis( N , N -di- p -methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene)) 136 , polymers (for example, poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)) 137
and inorganic materials (for example, CuI and CuSCN) 138 , 139 . The ETL in p–i–n PSCs is usually composed of fullerene or one of its derivatives (for example, [6,6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) or indene–C 60
bisadduct (ICBA)) 140 , 141 . HTL materials for p–i–n PSCs include polymers (for example, PEDOT:PSS and PTAA) 104 , 140
and inorganic materials (for example, NiO x
and CuSCN) 142 , 143 . Large-area PSCs require a compact, uniform and pinhole-free charge-transport layer. Thermal stability, process complexity and energy and time consumption, which add to cost, are also important considerations for scaling. Many charge-transport materials in PSCs originate from the fields of DSSCs and OPVs. Thus, scalable deposition of these layers can benefit from knowledge gained in fabricating DSSC and OPV modules. Electron-transport layer The most common ETL in n–i–p PSCs is TiO 2 . A compact TiO 2
layer can be deposited by either spray pyrolysis or a sol–gel method on glass substrates. Vacuum-based processes, such as radio-frequency sputtering 144 , thermal oxidation of a sputtered titanium film 145
and electron-beam evaporation 146 , are also used to generate uniform and high-quality compact TiO 2
films over large areas, but these processes usually require high-temperature annealing, which is often undesirable for flexible polymer substrates. Compact TiO 2
layers have also been deposited by low-temperature techniques, including atomic layer deposition 147 , 148 , TiCl 4
chemical bath deposition 149 , hydrothermal reaction 150
and electrodeposition 151 . For example, a compact TiO 2
layer was deposited on an indium-doped tin oxide (ITO)-coated polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film using atomic layer deposition. UV irradiation was also used to selectively sinter a TiO 2
mesoporous scaffold without affecting the polymer substrate underneath. This selective irradiation sintering enabled the fabrication of PSC modules on flexible PET substrates of up to 30 cm 2
(Ref.
148 ). SnO 2
is another representative ETL material used for PSCs, and there are several reasons for replacing TiO 2
with SnO 2
in PSCs: SnO 2
has a higher open-circuit voltage ( V OC ), smaller
J – V
hysteresis and negligible photocatalytic effect, which is beneficial for the long-term stability of PSCs 134 , 152 , 153 . Despite these advantages, deploying SnO 2
in PSCs on a large scale is challenging. The optimized thickness of the SnO 2
layer in PSCs is thinner than that of TiO 2 ; thus, it is more challenging to obtain a pinhole-free layer, especially on rough fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates. When SnO 2
is processed at high temperatures, it is usually too crystalline and conductive, and therefore cannot be used as an effective ETL in PSCs. Thus, SnO 2
films are normally deposited with low-temperature sol–gel deposition, atomic layer deposition, chemical bath deposition, hydrothermal reaction, colloidal solution approach and electrodeposition processes 134 , 152 – 155 . Hole-transport layer PEDOT:PSS is widely used as the HTL in inverted PSCs. However, PEDOT is hygroscopic and absorbs water from the environment, which is detrimental to the stability of the PSC 156 . NiO x
is a popular alternative to PEDOT, and it can be deposited using scalable deposition techniques such as sol–gel, spray pyrolysis, atomic layer deposition, sputtering and electrodeposition 142 , 157 – 161 . NiO x -based HTLs are usually annealed at 300–500 °C to increase their crystallinity and conductivity. The high-temperature treatment hinders the use of NiO x -based HTLs on flexible substrates. To address this challenge, a room-temperature solution processing method was developed to deposit pre-synthesized NiO x
nanocrystals to form a high-quality compact layer, leading to flexible PSCs with a PCE of 14.5% 162 . In a similar two-step approach, NiO x
nanocrystals were prepared using the flame-spray method, which enables high-throughput synthesis ( ∼ 1 kg h −1 ) and requires no additional annealing step to form highly crystalline NiO x
nanocrystals 163 . CuSCN is also widely used as the HTL in PSCs and can be deposited by blade coating, spray coating and electrodeposition 139 , 143 , 164 . All these materials have the potential to be used in the scalable fabrication of perovskite modules. The perovskite absorber layer, ETL and HTL of a PSC can be deposited using scalable deposition methods, but most scaling studies have focused on the scalable deposition of just one or two of the functional layers. Only a few studies have demonstrated fully printable PSCs. In one example, only blade coating was used to fabricate PSCs with a structure of PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI 3 −
x Cl x
/PCBM/bis-C 60 /Ag. With this device structure, the PCE of a blade-coated PSC is comparable to the PCE of a spin-coated PSC (10.4% and 11.0%, respectively) 83 . In another example of a fully slot-die printed PSC, the molecular structure of the HTL was designed to improve the morphology of the printed HTL film. Bifluo-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis( N , N -di- p -methoxyphenyl)amine-9,9′-bifluorenylidene) is an analogue of the common HTL spiro-OMeTAD; bifluo-OMeTAD was designed to have a fully
π -conjugated structure and exhibits less crystalline aggregation, a smoother film morphology and higher substrate coverage than spiro-OMeTAD. With the bifluo-OMeTAD HTL, PSCs fabricated solely by slot-die coating exhibited a PCE of 14.7%, which is higher than their spiro-OMeTAD counterparts 165 . Although some progress has been made, more effort is clearly required to develop fully scalable deposition schemes for all device layers so that PSCs can make the transition from the laboratory to a deployable technology. Scalable deposition of the back electrode Back electrodes for PSCs are mostly deposited by thermal evaporation. Evaporation is a scalable process and has been used for producing aluminium-coated packaging foils. Sputtering has been less explored for electrode deposition in PSCs, although the process is more favourable for large-scale fabrication as it is less dependent on the vacuum level and generally has shorter processing times than evaporation. The greatest challenge is ion bombardment damage of the organic charge-transport layer, which can be mitigated by inserting an inorganic buffer layer (for example, ZnO or MoO x ) 166 , 167 . Sputtering can be used to deposit metallic films, alloys or more complex compounds, such as transparent conducting oxides (for example, ITO or aluminium-doped zinc oxide (AZO)), which are common in semi-transparent devices and tandem applications. Oxide-based back electrodes also provide stability benefits to PSCs, which are discussed in the following section. Vacuum-free processes for depositing back contacts are highly desirable to fully exploit the solution processing advantages of PSCs. The use of screen-printed silver electrodes in slot-die-coated PSCs yielded only a slightly lower PCE than cells with silver electrodes fabricated through evaporation (6.4% versus 7.9%, respectively), showing the potential of vacuum-free fabrication 84 . Silver nanowire networks (suitable for semi-transparent PSCs) can be deposited by spray coating 168 . Another example of vacuum-free deposition is the development of a flexible adhesive electrode consisting of a nickel mesh and a layer of a conductive PEDOT:PSS/acrylic adhesive 169 . The flexible electrode can be laminated and bonded to the solar cell with a conductive adhesive to transport charges. The lamination process does not affect the underlying perovskite or HTL layers, and this process can be deployed in roll-to-roll fabrication 169 . Carbon is also an excellent candidate material for PSC electrodes because it is abundant, inexpensive, chemically stable and environmentally benign. Different forms of carbon materials, including graphite, carbon soot, carbon nanotubes and graphene, have been demonstrated as back electrodes in PSCs 22 , 23 , 170 , 171 . One outstanding example is an architecture composed of mesoporous-TiO 2 /ZrO 2 /perovskite/carbon (carbon black and graphite), for which all the layers can be screen printed, thus making the device fully scalable 22 . A perovskite module with a carbon electrode has been fabricated on a 10 cm × 10 cm substrate with an active-area efficiency of more than 10% and with a GFF of
∼ 50% 172 , 173 . Subsequently, the GFF was further improved to above 60%, leading to a certified module PCE of 9.1% 174 . PSC and module stability Stability and reliability at the module level are crucial for ensuring the commercial success of perovskite PV technology. There has been substantial progress in improving the PSC stability at the cell level over the past few years ( Fig. 6a ) owing to continuous research effort and a better understanding of the degradation mechanisms. This topic has been thoroughly reviewed in several recent articles, in which more detailed information can be found 175 – 178 . In general, better PSC stability can be achieved with improvement across the device components by modifying the perovskite composition and the choice of charge-transport layers and electrode material. Recent demonstrations have shown the importance of the interfaces within the device. Further understanding of how the interfaces change over time along with associated degradation processes is needed to realize perovskite modules that have no stability issues 179 . Figure 6: Stability of perovskite solar cells and modules. a

Full size image Perovskite composition MAPbI 3
is prone to decomposing into PbI 2 , CH 3 NH 2
and HI upon exposure to heat or moisture 180 . FAPbI 3
has better resistance to heat and moisture, but pure FAPbI 3
is not stable in the cubic structure and tends to transform into a hexagonal structure and become non-photoactive. Alloying FA +
with smaller cations (for example, MA + , Cs +
or Rb + ) can stabilize the perovskite structure and suppress phase transition 181 – 183
( Fig. 6b ). Partially replacing I −
with Br −
(<15 mol%) has also been shown to improve stability 184 . A PSC with a FA-based mixed-cation (RbCsMAFA) perovskite showed impressive stability against heat and light soaking, retaining 95% of the initial PCE after ageing for 500 h at 85 °C with continuous illumination (AM1.5, one sun equivalent from a white light-emitting diode) under N 2
atmosphere 183 . Long-chain or bulky organic ammonium cations can passivate the perovskite surfaces and block moisture ingression 185 , 186 . A 2D−3D perovskite composed of both MA +
and butylammonium (BA + ) also exhibited a strong resistance against moisture-induced degradation, maintaining 70% of the initial PCE after 2,000 h of one-sun illumination under ambient conditions 187 . Charge-transport layers The stability of charge-transport layers and their interfaces with perovskite materials are crucial to the stability of PSCs 179 . The conventional ETL, TiO 2 , has a photocatalytic effect and can cause perovskite degradation under UV illumination. Better stability can be attained with alternative ETLs, such as SnO 2 , BaSnO 3
and chloride-treated TiO 2
nanoparticles 188 – 190 . Spiro-OMeTAD, the most commonly used HTL, can also introduce a stability issue in PSCs. Spiro-OMeTAD HTL films often have pinholes, which facilitates moisture ingression and leads to attack of the perovskite layer 165 , 191 . Lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) is often used as a dopant in spiro-OMeTAD to increase its conductivity. However, the hygroscopic LiTFSI dopant in spiro-OMeTAD films attracts water, and the Li +
ions are highly mobile and can migrate into the perovskite layer and potentially accelerate device degradation 192 . HTLs based on hydrophobic molecules and dopants have delivered improved stability 193 . Dopant-free polymer HTLs are also promising for the fabrication of stable PSCs 194 , 195 . Other potential HTLs for PSCs with long-term stability are inorganic HTLs, such as carbon nanotubes, NiO x , CuI and CuSCN, which are generally denser than their organic counterparts 138 , 196 – 198 . In one example, CuSCN was used as the HTL in a PSC, and the device achieved a lifetime of more than 1,000 h (retaining >95% of the initial PCE) under full-sun illumination at 85 °C (Ref.
198 ). Electrode materials Although the electrode materials are not in direct contact with the perovskite layer, the stability of the electrode materials is also important to the long-term operation of PSCs. Silver electrodes react with halides to form silver halides 199
( Fig. 6c ). Gold electrodes are more stable, but it has been shown that gold can diffuse into the perovskite layer and cause irreversible device degradation 200 . The degradation of the electrode materials could be more serious at the module scale than in a single cell, as the electrode material at the interconnection region is in direct contact with the perovskite, which can lead to faster corrosion. Metal oxides have better resistance against halide corrosion, and they can be used as barriers to protect the metal electrodes. Double-layer electrodes, such as Cr 2 O 3 /Cr, MoO x /Al and ZnO/Al, have shown improved stability in PSCs 156 , 201 , 202 . TCOs can also serve as back electrodes in PSCs. For example, ITO was shown to be more stable than metal electrodes in PSCs, with ITO both eliminating electrode corrosion and alleviating perovskite egression. Even with thermally unstable MAPbI 3 , devices with ITO electrodes yielded a
T 80
lifetime (the time taken to reach 80% of the initial efficiency) of 120 h at 100 °C, whereas cells based on metal electrodes failed within minutes 167 . PSCs with a porous carbon back electrode usually exhibit exceptional long-term stability (>1,000 h) under light and ambient conditions; the thick carbon electrode can effectively encapsulate the device, preventing external moisture ingress and internal perovskite egress 39 . A PSC with a carbon electrode, a glass seal and a UV-filter yielded a lifetime of 10,000 h at 55 °C (Ref.
172 ). Encapsulation In addition to continuously improving the stability of PSCs through advances in material properties, encapsulation can serve as extra protection against degradation. Encapsulation with, for example, a fluoropolymer, hydrophobic carbon electrode and/or metal oxide barrier layer has been used to improve the stability of PSCs to levels similar to those reported for devices operating under N 2
or another inert atmosphere 39 , 156 , 197 , 203 . In another example, FA 1 −

PSCs were encapsulated by two glass sheets, and the edges were sealed with commercial sealants (ethylene vinyl acetate and butyl rubber). These PSCs passed stability tests under the International Electrotechnical Commission’s damp–heat conditions (85 °C and 85% relative humidity for 1,000 h), validating other cell-level tests and demonstrating the promise of stabilizing PSCs using the encapsulation strategy 177 . Future research directions will include exploring low-cost and reliable encapsulation materials as well as developing processes to minimize the impact on modules during encapsulation. Module-related degradation Degradation at the module level is more complicated than at the single-cell level. In addition to the potential of additional processing-induced degradation pathways in the more complex production of modules, certain reliability concerns are unique to monolithically interconnected PSC modules, such as the halogen-induced degradation of module interconnections, degradation or module failure caused by partial shading and material fatigue and/or structure failure owing to ion migration. In a partially shaded module, the shaded cells are subjected to a high reverse bias, which could lead to local hot spots and inverted-bias junction damage 204 , 205
( Fig. 6d,e ). These same effects might also couple to intrinsic and extrinsic ionic conduction phenomena to change the module performance over time. Thus, it is necessary to investigate the stability of PSCs under reverse bias and in realistic module configurations. Characterization of modules When transitioning from laboratory-scale to module-level development, it is important to be able to evaluate and control the uniformity of the material properties at the film and device levels, the distribution of defects related to the material, device and operation, and the locations of shorts and shunts, as well as the interconnection properties in modules. Techniques suitable for characterizing and guiding the development of large-area perovskite thin-film solar cells and modules are discussed below. Composition, structure and properties Characterization of the composition, structure and properties of perovskites is important for developing PSC fabrication technology. The most common characterization techniques for small-area PSCs are X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV–vis spectrophotometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), optical microscopy, photoluminescence (PL) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy/UV photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS/UPS). These characterization techniques coupled with a mapping capability can be used to study the uniformity and homogeneity of perovskite thin films for large-area device and/or module development. High-speed inline optical imaging, UV–vis and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy ( Fig. 7a ) inspection technologies will be helpful for industrial fabrication, and they have been widely used for quality control in traditional PV fabrication. For example, an in situ X-ray scattering system was developed for a roll-to-roll perovskite coater. The system was used to study the formation and degradation of perovskites on flexible substrates, but it can also be used to investigate the crystalline uniformity of roll-to-roll-coated films 206 .

curves and incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) are mostly used to evaluate the performance of small-area devices. However,
J – V
and IPCE tests with spot-size illumination or a small-area electrode have been used to characterize the uniformity of large-area perovskite devices 59 , 62 , 83 . Light-beam-induced current (LBIC) mapping uses a small laser spot to scan the active area of solar cells and provides a local photocurrent generation profile of the device. LBIC mapping has been used to map an 8 cm 2
perovskite solar module; the inhomogeneous current distribution clearly revealed the non-uniformity of the perovskite films, thus indicating the need to improve the coating uniformity in future device optimization 207 . LBIC mapping is also used to investigate the degradation mechanism of PSCs under different ambient conditions 208
( Fig. 7b ). Photoemission spectroscopy and imaging Solar cells are optimized for light harvesting and subsequent carrier separation. Reversing the process, that is, applying a forward bias and injecting carriers into the device, leads to carrier recombination and photon emission. Electroluminescence (EL) is the basic working mechanism of semiconductor light-emitting diodes, and it can be used to study non-radiative recombination in PSCs and to predict the theoretical
V OC
limits of devices 209 , 210 . An EL imaging setup for a PSC is relatively simple because perovskites have a larger bandgap than silicon (the most common material used in charge-coupled device arrays), and the data acquisition speed in EL imaging is much faster than in LBIC mapping. An EL image can provide information about charge recombination at the nanoscale 211
and macroscopic charge-transport obstacles associated with non-uniformity, impurities, shunting and internal resistance 70 , 212 – 215 . EL and PL are usually used as complementary methods to reveal macroscopic defects in devices ( Fig. 6c ). Recombination centres, weak diodes and shunting regions suppress the radiative recombination of carriers; thus, they appear darker in the EL and PL images. Regions with higher contact resistance impede current injection and photon-generated carrier dissipation, resulting in weaker EL and stronger PL features in the images 175 , 178 . Lock-in thermography Lock-in thermography (LIT) is also a useful imaging tool for identifying local defects in solar cells ( Fig. 7c ). LIT can be operated in three modes, with each mode being sensitive to different types of defects. Illuminated LIT (ILIT) generates a photovoltage in solar cells with pulse illumination. When charge carriers recombine at the locations of recombination centres, weak diodes or shunting paths, heat is generated, which can be detected by an IR camera. Dark LIT (DLIT) can be operated at forward or reverse bias: DLIT fwd
detects heat at shunted spots, weak diode locations or regions with poor contact and high series resistance, whereas DLIT rev
is sensitive to shunts that conduct current at reverse bias 216 . Interconnections in modules In addition to the film and device uniformity, the interconnections are another key determinant of module operation. LIT in conjunction with EL and PL imaging is useful for identifying the shunting, shorts and high-resistance regions in individual sub-cells and interconnections in solar modules. In general, a shunted or shorted sub-cell appears darker in an EL image because the current passes through shunting points instead of the absorber layer. In this situation, a local hot spot appears at the shunting point owing to Joule heating, resulting in a brighter spot in the DLIT image. High sheet resistance or series resistance is also recognizable from DLIT images under high forward-injection conditions.
Figure 7d
shows EL and LIT images of an amorphous silicon thin-film solar module with one shorted sub-cell. The shorting location in the interconnection can be seen as a hot spot in the LIT image 217 . Module cost and life cycle assessment There are two main challenges for large-scale PV technologies: first, enabling the low-cost production of PV systems at scale and second, achieving sustainability (including ensuring resource availability and minimizing any negative environmental impact) in the case of terawatt-scale deployment 14 . Insight regarding the former has been gained through several cost model studies based on hypothesized device stacks and production workflows 218 – 220 . These studies show clear cost advantages of PSCs over other PV technologies. However, the various attempts to examine the cost competitiveness of PSCs must be viewed critically, because some of the device-stack configurations examined may not be feasible to implement at scale in the future. This points to a range of opportunities for innovations in device-stack configurations and/or materials for large-scale PSCs but also highlights the difficulty in undertaking realistic cost assessments of deployable PSCs at this nascent stage of technology development and with the present lack of certainty regarding module requirements (for example, encapsulation, weight and structure). Although there has been continued progress, the factor that remains most uncertain is the stability 218 . Life cycle assessments provide insight into the environmental impact and the sustainability of a particular PSC stack. Life cycle assessments rely on more well-established energy and CO 2
costs associated with materials production rather than direct monetary costs. The life cycle assessments of PSCs to date have looked at only a few (of the many) PSC architectures. In one study, an energy payback time of less than 0.3 years for PSCs with an n–i–p structure was calculated, which is much shorter than that of other PV technologies 221 . It is important to note the limited extent to which life cycle assessments have so far been used in comparing PSCs with other established technologies. In the context of terawatt-scale energy production and the development of a sustainable PV economy, the cost of production as well as the cost of refurbishing and/or disposing of any PV must also be considered. Challenges and outlook Although PSCs have already shown promise towards large-scale deployment, many challenges remain. Key materials and processing challenges include the fully scalable fabrication of all device layers and reliable schemes for module interconnection. These challenges are further complicated because the most ideal device architecture has not yet been identified; several architecture–materials combinations have shown high performance, with good progress in terms of stability at the cell level. In addition, the composition of perovskites has become increasingly complex for high efficiency and/or stability in laboratory-scale devices. Transferring the new material compositions to production scale requires more effort in process engineering because of changes in the material processing properties. Lowering the cost and environmental impact of the final PV modules will require further reductions in the cost and energy consumption of resource extraction, material synthesis and film processing for the different components in PSCs — especially for the noble metal electrode (gold), transparent conducting substrates (ITO or FTO), spiro-OMeTAD-based HTL and fullerene-based ETL. Some alternative materials with great potential have been proposed and demonstrated, such as double-layer MoO x /Al and Cr 2 O 3 /Cr back electrodes 201 , 222 . As perovskite technology matures, the ideal device architecture, with scalable materials, and module fabrication process will likely be identified. This will enable more reliable cost modelling and life cycle assessments of the suitability of perovskite PVs for terawatt-scale deployment. Finally, on the basis of the remarkable progress in the efficiency and stability of PSCs, it is increasingly important to consider these performance metrics in the context of scalability. We are still at an early stage of understanding and addressing the challenges of scaling up PSCs with respect to the myriad device stacks and effective schemes for module interconnection. However, the rapid development towards scaling up at a relevant performance level (efficiency and stability) coupled with the low-cost manufacturing capability has already attracted substantial industrial interest worldwide ( Table 2 ). The challenges for PSC scaling outline clear research needs that are informed by industry through the potential supply chain for PSCs to ensure that highly scalable choices are made at the same time that the efficiency and stability are improved. If these issues can be addressed, the potential for PSCs, compared with other PV technologies, to have an impact on global energy production at the terawatt scale is unrivalled.

Abstract
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites with mixed organic cations and/or halides have attracted increasing attention due to their superior optoelectronic properties, which are tailorable for different applications. To obtain a deeper understanding of materials properties, single crystals are regarded as the best platform among various building blocks for fundamental study. Here, we synthesized a series of perovskite single crystals with mixed organic cations (APbI 3 , A = CH 3 NH 3 + , MA + ; or CH(NH 2 ) 2 + , FA + ) along the compositional space, and conducted a systematic investigation to correlate the carrier behavior with the organic cations. The single crystals were synthesized
via
inverse temperature crystallization assisted by hydroiodic acid, where the quality of the crystals could be judiciously controlled by the thermodynamic process. It is found that the substitution of 15% MA +
in FAPbI 3
single crystals stabilizes the phase with the best charge transport characteristics. Both photodetector and
J – V
measurements suggested that FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 3
single crystal exhibits suppressed ion migration compared with the counterpart FA 0.15 MA 0.85 PbI 3
single crystal. These results represent an important step to highlight the role of organic cations in hybrid perovskite materials, which will further benefit fundamental understanding of materials and device optimization.

We have investigated GaAs-based
p - i - n
quantum dot solar cells (QDSCs) with 10 up to 20 stacked layers of self-assembled InAs quantum dots (QDs) grown by atomic hydrogen-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. The net average lattice strain was minimized by using the strain-compensation technique, in which GaNAs dilute nitrides were used as spacer layers. The filtered short-circuit current density beyond GaAs bandedge was
2.47   mA / cm 2
for strain-compensated QDSC with 20 stacks of InAs QD layers, which was four times higher than that for strained QDSC with identical cell structure.

Recently, low-dimensional semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) incorporated in the active region of a
p - i - n
junction solar cell (SC) have attracted intense research as a possible means of exploiting the sub-bandgap photons to generate an additional photocurrent beyond that corresponding to the band-to-band transition in a conventional single-junction SC. 1
In quantum dot solar cells (QDSCs), the QDs should be uniform in size and periodically distributed in all three dimensions, which lead to the formation of an intermediate band or a miniband rather than a multiplicity of discrete quantized levels in order to achieve the predicted high conversion efficiencies. 2
The experimental demonstration of QDSCs requires placing a three-dimensional (3D) QD superlattice in the active region. 3
The most popular fabrication technique of QDs is to take advantage of spontaneous self-assembly or self-organization mechanism of coherent 3D islanding during growth known as Stranski–Krastanov (S-K) growth in lattice-mismatched epitaxy. However, the S-K growth in InAs/GaAs system usually results in degradation of QD structure and generation of misfit dislocations, typically after 10 layers of stacking, as a result of accumulation of internal strain beyond the critical thickness. 4,5
Previously, we reported an InP-based QDSC with 30 stacked InAs/AlGaInAs QD layers on InP (311)B substrate fabricated using the strain-compensation technique. 6
Here the compressive strain due to the QD layer was compensated by a tensile strain induced by the spacer layer 7–10
and the size dispersion improved to
12 % – 13 % ⁠ . 11
Recently, this technique has been applied to InAs/GaNAs material system fabricated on a more cost-effective GaAs substrate. 12
This work reports on the basic result of InAs/GaNAs QDSCs fabricated using the strain-compensation technique.
We fabricated four series of SCs—S1, S2, S3, and S4—on
n + -GaAs (001) substrates by atomic hydrogen-assisted molecular beam epitaxy with a radio frequency plasma as the nitrogen source. 13,14
The four samples were identical in the structure except for the
i -layer region as shown in Fig.
1 . The samples S1 and S2 were grown with 10 and 20 stacked pairs of an InAs QD layer with 2.0 ML thicknesses and a 20 nm-thick
GaN 0.01 As 0.99
strain-compensation layer (SCL), respectively. The sample S3 comprised of 20 pairs of 2.0 ML InAs QDs and 20 nm-thick GaAs spacer layers, and hence the QD structure was strained. Last, the sample S4 was a GaAs control cell with a 400 nm-thick
i -GaAs layer used as a reference. For electrical characterization, AuZn alloy was used for the front electrode and indium for the back, and a standard anti-reflection coating (ARC) using
MgF 2
was employed in
3 × 3   mm 2
sized SCs.

We measured the symmetric scans around the (004) reflection in a
ω - 2 θ
geometry in high resolution x-ray diffraction (XRD) in order to characterize the effect of strain compensation. Figure

show the XRD spectra for samples S2 and S3. The satellite peaks originating from the periodic superlattice structure can be clearly observed in each sample, and hence abrupt heterointerfaces are maintained. For S2, the zeroth-order satellite peak S(0) indicated by an arrow in the figure shows a near lattice match with GaAs substrate as shown in Fig.
2(a) . Therefore, the net average compressive strain induced by InAs QD layers is approximately compensated by 20 nm-thick
GaN 0.01 As 0.99
SCLs though not precisely balanced out in all three dimensions of QDs. 15

Figure

shows the cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) image measured for S2. A vertical alignment of the lens-shaped QDs along the growth direction is maintained from one layer to the next without degrading the structure and size uniformity. Further, we observe no strain-induced defects or dislocations from the image, which would otherwise be generated if the buildup of lattice strain exceeds the critical layer thickness during stacking. 5,10
The mean QD diameter, height, size dispersion in diameter, and in-plane density were 39.1 nm, 5.2 nm, 13.4%, and
3.6 × 10 10 / cm 2 ⁠ , respectively. As a result, the total density of QDs amounts to the order of
10 12 / cm 2 ⁠ , which would be extremely difficult to achieve by the conventional strained S-K growth.

Figures
4 (a) – (d) show the internal quantum efficiencies (IQEs) of QDSCs S1–S4, respectively. The IQE was determined from a direct measurement of the external QE under a constant photon irradiation of
10 16 / cm 2 ⁠ , then discounting for the shadowing loss and residual reflection loss arising from ARC. We also measured the photoluminescence (PL) for each sample at room temperature by using a standard lock-in technique with a cw 532 nm second harmonic generation
Nd : YVO 4
laser as an excitation source and InGaAs photodetector. The PL spectrum obtained for S2 is shown in Fig.
4(e) , which is used to identify the photoabsorption edge for each layer. First, a single PL emission peak from the ground state of InAs QDs is observed at around 1170 nm with a full width at half maximum of 65.4 meV. In addition, a shoulder peak originating from both GaNAs spacer layer and InAs wetting layer is seen at around 980 nm for S1 and S2, and 880 nm for S3, respectively. Second, the absorption edge redshifts from 1150 nm for S3 up to 1200 nm for S2, and this is because the quantum confinement is lower at the conduction band interface when GaNAs is used as the barrier instead of GaAs. 14,16

The filtered short-circuit current density
( I sc )
of sample S2 (strain-compensated, 20 stacks) beyond the GaAs bandedge of
∼ 880   nm ⁠ , which gives the contribution from QD layer, was determined to be
2.47   mA / cm 2
by taking the product of IQE and solar spectrum (AM1.5). This value was twice that of S1 (strain-compensated, 10 stacks) and four times larger than that of S3 (strained, 20 stacks), respectively. Though the obtained value is notably higher than the reported values for QDSCs, 3,10,17
the maximum IQE from the QD layers even for S2 is still limited to
∼ 5 % ⁠ , and thus a larger stack of QD layers is required to obtain higher photoabsorption. Furthermore, the fact that the degradation of QEs in the shorter wavelength is not observed after increasing the QD layer from 10 to 20 stacks suggests that the crystalline quality is maintained in our strain-compensated QDSCs as the contribution to the photocurrent generated by the
p -GaAs emitter is not affected. The dark
I - V
measurements show an improved diode factor of
n = 1.42
for S2 compared to
n = 1.62
for S3 due to the reduction in recombination loss as a result of the strain compensation. 18
To this end,
I sc
improved to
21.1   mA / cm 2
for S2 compared to
19.0   mA / cm 2
for S1 and
19.6   mA / cm 2
for S3, respectively, and
I sc = 19.7   mA / cm 2
for the control cell S4 with 400 nm-thick
i -GaAs layer as a reference. The projected conversion efficiency is 8.5% and 5.7% for strain-compensated S1 and S2 QDSC, respectively.
In summary, we have fabricated and characterized InAs/GaNAs QDSCs fabricated using the strain-compensation technique on GaAs(001) substrates. Compensating for the lattice strain induced by QDs with a spacer layer that produces the opposite strain works well to achieve an improved size uniformity, a redshift of absorption edge, and to avoid generation of defects and dislocations. The total QD density of our QDSC with 20 stacks of InAs QD is on the order of
10 12 / cm 2
and
I sc = 21.1   mA / cm 2 ⁠ . The filtered
I sc
beyond GaAs band edge of
2.47   mA / cm 2
is four times higher than that for a strained QDSC with identical cell structure.
