I. General Characteristics of Perovskites as
Catalysts
The vast majority of catalysts used in modern
chemical industry are based on mixed metal oxides.The preparation of specific tailor-made mixed oxidesable to perform complex functions is one of the maintopics of research in the field of heterogeneouscatalysis. Achieving complex catalytic reactions re-quires a polyfunctional catalyst with appropriatesolid state, surface, and morphological properties.The extensive background knowledge in solid state-surface chemistry carried out in the field of hetero-geneous catalysis may be usefully applied in thedesign of catalyst and the engineering of new highperformance materials. A wide cross-fertilizationbridges heterogeneous catalysis and materials sciencein the fields of physicochemical characterization,solid-state chemistry, and routes of synthesis.

Among the mixed metal oxides, perovskite-type
oxides remain prominent. The perovskite oxides havethe general formula ABO
3(A cation of larger size
than B). Although the most numerous and mostinteresting compounds with the perovskite structureare oxides, some carbides, nitrides, halides, andhydrides also crystallize in this structure. This reviewwill focus only on the study of oxides and theirrelevance in heterogeneous catalysis and surfacechemistry. It will not cover physical properties suchas the electric, magnetic, and optical properties of theperovskites. Comprehensive studies on these proper-ties have been summarized in our previous bookreview.
4The broad diversity of properties that these
compounds exhibit is derived from the fact thataround 90% of the metallic natural elements of thePeriodic Table are known to be stable in a perovskite-type oxide structure and also from the possibility ofsynthesizing multicomponent perovskites by partialsubstitution of cations in positions A and B, givingrise to substituted compounds with formula of

A1-xA′xB1-xB′xO3. These characteristics account for
the large variety of reactions in which they are usedas catalysts. Other important aspects of perovskitesare related to the stability of mixed oxidation states
or unusual oxidation states in the crystal structure.This is illustrated by the discovery of a metallic Cu
2+-
Cu3+mixed valence La-Ba-Cu oxide, which greatly
favored the development of perovskites showing high-temperature superconductivity.
5Besides this, be-
cause of their controllable physical and chemicalproperties these isomorphic compounds offer excel-lent models for chemists not only for catalytic reac-tions but also for establishing correlations betweenreactivity and surface and/or bulk properties.
In this review, we have attempted to avoid over-
lapping with our previous review,
4but the minimum
fundamental aspects are given to provide a soundoverview about the subject addressed. Althoughperovskite materials have not yet found applicationas commercial catalysts, their importance in effortsto correlate solid-state chemistry with catalytic prop-erties, their properties as they depend on the prepa-ration methods, and the fact that they can be tailoredfor specific catalytic needs make these oxides proto-type models for heterogeneous catalysts.
In section II, perovskite and other related struc-
tures are briefly summarized. Section III refers to theacid -base and redox properties of the perovskites,
which will facilitate an understanding of the catalyticaction of these systems. Section IV reviews thereactions in which perovskite oxides have been usedas catalysts. Emphasis is placed not only on reactionsthat have been studied in depth in recent years butalso on the relationship between catalytic perfor-mance and solid-state properties. Finally, in lastsection, based on the whole work, some prospectivelines of research are suggested.
II. Structure of Perovskites
A. Crystal Structure
The ideal perovskite-type structure is cubic with
space group Pm3m-Oh1. In the unit formula of per-
ovskite-type oxides ABO 3, A is the larger cation and
B is the smaller cation. In this structure, the B cationis 6-fold coordinated and the A cation is 12-foldcoordinated with the oxygen anions. Figure 1 depictsthe corner sharing octahedra that form the skeletonof the structure, in which the center position isoccupied by the A cation. Alternatively, this structurecan be viewed with the B cation placed in the centerof the octahedron and the A cation is in the center ofthe cube. The perovskite structure is thus a super-structure with a ReO
3-type framework built up by
the incorporation of A cations into the BO 6octahedra.
The significance and role of the ReO 3-type framework
as a host structure for deriving numerous structuresof metal oxides has been emphasized by Raveau.

In the ideal structure, where the atoms are touch-
ing one another, the B -O distance is equal to a/2
(ais the cubic unit cell parameter) while the A -O
distance is ( a/x2) and the following relationship
between the ionic radii holds: rA+rO)x2(rB+rO).
However, it was found that the cubic structure wasstill retained in ABO
3compounds, even though this
equation is not exactly obeyed. As a measure of thedeviation from the ideal situation, Goldschmidt

introduced a tolerance factor ( t), defined by the
equation:
which is applicable at room temperature to the
empirical ionic radii. Although for an ideal perovskitetis unity, this structure is also found for lower
t-values (0.75 <t<1.0). The ideal cubic perovskite
structure appears in a few cases for t-values very
close to 1 and at high temperatures. In most cases,different distortions of the perovskite structure ap-pear. The naturally occurring compound CaTiO
3was
originally thought to be cubic, but its true symmetrywas later shown to be orthorhombic.
8
The simple perovskite structure may be appropri-
ately modified by incorporating two types of B ionswith suitable different size and charge. The mostfrequent substitutions are the equiatomic proportionsof the two ions at the B-site, for which the generalformula of the perovskite is A
2BB′O6(or AB 0.5B′0.5O3).
The resulting unit cell may be viewed as doubledalong the three axes, regarding the primitive cell ofABO
3. If the charge of B and B ′is different, in the
ordered structure the oxygens are slightly shiftedtoward the more charged cation although the octa-hedral symmetry of B and B ′cations is preserved.
Deviations from the ideal structure with ortho-
rhombic, rhombohedral, tetragonal, monoclinic, andtriclinic symmetry are known, although the latterthree ones are scarce and poorly characterized.
9-11
The distorted structure may exist at room tempera-
ture, but it transforms to the cubic structure at hightemperature. This transition may occur in several
steps through intermediate distorted phases. Thesedeviations from the cubic perovskite structure mayproceed from a simple distortion of the cubic unit cell,or an enlargement of of the cubic unit cell, or acombination of both.B. Nonstoichiometry in Perovskites
Besides the ionic radii requirements, another con-
dition to be fulfilled is electroneutrality, i.e., the sumof charges of A and B equals the total charge ofoxygen anions. This is attained by means of ap-propriate charge distribution of the form A
1+B5+O3,
A2+B4+O3,o rA3+B3+O3. In addition to this, partial
substitution of A and B ions is allowed, thus yieldinga plethora of compounds while preserving the per-ovskite structure. However, deficiencies of cations atthe A- or B-sites or of oxygen anions are frequent,which results in defective perovskites. The non-stoichiometry in perovskites has been widely dis-cussed in several reviews.
12-14
Oxygen vacancies are more common than those
involving cationic vacancies. The best-known ex-ample of perovskite oxide with ordered anion vacan-cies is the browmillerite structure exhibited byCa
2Fe2O514and La 2Ni2O5.15The former composition
can be considered as an anion-deficient perovskitewith one-sixth of the oxygen ions being vacant.Oxygen vacancies are ordered in alternate (001) BO
2
planes of the cubic structure such that alternate [110]rows of oxide anions are missing. Ordering of oxygenvacancies appears more complex in O-deficient La
2-
Ni2O5perovskite. Since tetrahedral coordination of
Ni2+is unlikely, it has been suggested that oxygen
vacancies ordering in La 2Ni2O5is accommodated by
means of disordered intergrowths of octahedral andsquare-planar layers. The review by Rao et al.
12
covers these aspects with several examples. Untilnow, only a few examples with an apparent oxygenexcess are known. This can be achieved by theintroduction of cation vacancies at the A- and/orB-site. Structural features of this type of compoundcan be found in the reviews by Rao et al.

1. Oxygen Nonstoichiometry
Oxygen excess nonstoichiometry in perovskite ox-
ides is not as common as anion-deficient nonstoichi-ometry probably because introduction of interstitialoxygen in perovskite structure is thermodynamicallyunfavorable. A few systems display apparent oxygenexcess, including LaMnO
3+ì,B a 1-ìLa ìTiO 3+ì/2and
EuTiO 3+ì. The best-characterized perovskite showing
oxidative nonstoichiometry is LaMnO 3+ì. This sample,
prepared by calcination of the individual oxides inair at 1473 K, proved to have a composition ofLaMnO
3.12.16Similar ìvalues for lanthanum man-
ganite were reported by Voorhoeve et al.,17Vogel et
al.,18Taguchi et al.,19and Kamegashira et al.20
Neutron diffraction studies revealed that oxygenexcess in LaMnO
3.12is accommodated by vacancies
at the A- and B-sites with partial elimination of La(as La
2O3), the composition of the perovskite being
La0.94 0.06 Mn 0.98 0.02 O3(blank space is a cation va-
cancy). The nonstoichiometry in LaMnO 3+ìcan also
be modified by partial substitution of A and Bcations.
21-23Thus, in Sr xLa1-xMnO 3+ìperovskites
(x)0.0-0.5) Mizusaki et al.23found oxygen non-
stoichiometry in the temperature range from 873 to1273 K. For x e0.4, the plot of 3 +ìvs log P(O

teaus: one around the stoichiometric point ( ì)0.0)
and the other at low temperatures and high P(O2)a t
which 3 +ìwas saturated. The plot of 3 +ìvs log P(O2)
was rationalized in terms of a defect model, which isbased on the following assumptions: (i) Because thetrivalent cation vacancies cause a large electronicimbalance and local lattice distortion, they do notstay close to each other. (ii) with the formation ofcation vacancies, a nonbonding O2p level is formedby the oxide ions around the vacancies. This non-bonding O2p level serves as the hole-trap. Applyingthis structure, nonstoichiometry of the oxygen-deficient composition was explained by the randomdistribution of oxide-ion vacancies. However, analysisbased on the defect equilibrium did not allow theidentification of the cation vacancy site, whether itis a La site or a Mn site, or both, because the resultswere almost identical whatever the cation vacancysite. Fortunately, a detailed neutron diffraction analy-sis was conclusive, placing the cation vacanciespredominantly on the La site.
Many oxygen-deficient perovskites can be described
on the basis of complex perovskite-related super-structures of general formula A
nBnO3n-1, in which the
stacking manner depends on the size, electronicconfigurations, and coordination numbers of A andB cations.
24Although most of the 3d cations have led
to the formation of these A nBnO3n-1phases, the nickel
family has been less studied due to the difficulty instabilizing this element with two oxidation states.
Pioneering work by Crespin et al.
25revealed that the
La2Ni2O5phase, where Ni shows a 2 +formal oxida-
tion state, is monoclinic showing a brownmillerite-type structure, i.e., with one octahedral layer alter-nating with one tetrahedral layer along the baxis.
However, Rao et al.
26described this material on the
basis of a tetragonal cell, the oxygen vacancies givingrise to square-planar and octahedral coordination forNi
2+. A detailed description of the microstructure of
LaNiO 3-y(y)0.50, 0.33, 0.25, and 0.20) perovskites
was done by Sayague ´s et al.15using high-resolution
electron microscopy (HREM) and selected area elec-tron diffraction (SAED).
For the La
2Ni2O5stoichiometry, the most likely
structural model can be described as formed by anoctahedral layer alternating, in an ordered way, witha square-planar layer along the [100]
cdirection.
However, the cell symmetry is, according to Crespinet al.,
25monoclinic probably due to a tilt of the
octahedra. In La 4Ni4O11unoccupied oxygen positions
are located on the octahedral apex of the perovskitesuperstructure leading to square-planar coordinationfor the 50% of Ni
2+. Finally, oxygen nonstoichiometry
in both LaNiO 2.8and LaNiO 2.67is accommodated by
disordered intergrowth of octahedral and square-planar layers along [100]
c. According to the structural
models,15it appears that the square-planar coordina-
tion layers are coincident in each nplanes. However,
for odd members, the periodicity range is longer sincethe square-planar layers only coincide every 2 n
planes, suggesting that different thermodynamicconditions would be necessary to stabilize them.
LaCuO
3-äperovskite is stable over a remarkably
wide oxygen stoichiometry range, i.e., 0.5 gäg0.0.27The stabilization of the highly oxidized rhombohedral
LaCuO 3is only achieved under a very high oxygen
pressure of 6.5 GPa and 1670 K.28This stoichiometric
perovskite, containing 100% Cu3+, loses oxygen upon
heating under ambient oxygen pressure, yieldingseveral LaCuO
3-äoxygen deficient phases as inter-
mediates. Thus, the tetragonal, monoclinic, andorthorhombic forms of oxygen-deficient LaCuO
3-äcan
be isolated as pure phases by annealing in Ar at 573,673, and 773 K, respectively.
29It was found that the
presence of a large number of ordered oxygen vacan-cies in the bulk structure and the ability to form asurface shell of CuO
6polyhedra, with Cu3+, contain-
ing very labile oxygen ions, account for the highcatalytic activity in CO oxidation in the most oxygen-defective materials.
30
2. Cation Nonstoichiometry
An oxygen excess can also readily be achieved in
perovskites that are structurally deficient in oxygenbecause of cation nonstoichiometry. For example, ithas been shown that CaTiO
3can accept excess TiO 2
in solid solution up to 1%, and it is assumed that thisis accommodated by the formation of calcium andoxygen vacancies.
31The resulting oxygen vacancies
enhance the oxidation of the material. The minimumvalue in the equilibrium conductivity shifts to loweroxygen activities with increasing excess TiO
2in the
same way that it shifts with increasing acceptorcontents.
31,32TiO 2-rich compositions can be consid-
ered to be stoichiometric with respect to the oxygencontent, i.e., with respect to oxidation -reduction
equilibria, when they are composed of a combinationof the stoichiometric binary oxides, (1 -x)CaO +TiO
2
or Ca 1-xTiO 3-x. On the other hand, they are obviously
nonstoichiometric with respect to the cation ratio.
B-site vacancies in perovskite oxides are not so
common, although a few examples displaying thistype of defect are known. This is a consequence ofthe fact that the B-site vacancies are not thermody-namically favored because of the large charge andthe small size of the B cations. B -B interactions,
which can be regarded as a compensating factor, arefavored by the hexagonal stacking of AO
3layers.
Thus, a number of hexagonal perovskites containingB-site vacancies has been described.
12These vacan-
cies are usually ordered between h -h layers, where
the BO 6octahedra share faces, in agreement with the
Pauling’s rules for the sharing of coordination poly-hedra. According to this rule, corner-sharing is morefavorable than face-sharing polyhedra in quasi- ionic
crystals. Thus, Ba
5Ta4O15displays a five-layer se-
quence in which the octahedral site between the h -h
layers is vacant. Such an ordering gives rise toisolated clusters of four octehedra that share eachtwo opposite corners [Ta
4O15]10-.
Other perovskites exhibit A-site vacancies. This is
because the BO 3array in the perovskite structure
forms a stable network, the large A cation at 12coordinated sites can be partially missing. Oneinteresting example of A-site defective perovskite isthe Cu
0.5TaO 3, which displays a pseudocubic perov-
skite structure. Its unit cell is orthorhombic witheight formula units per cell. Tantalum atoms form a1984 Chemical Reviews, 2001, Vol. 101, No. 7 Pen ˜a and Fierro
TaO 3framework as in a cubic perovskite, while the
copper ions are ordered at the A-site. Three of themare located in the middle of the cube edges, while thefourth is statistically distributed over the three facecenters.
C. Physical Properties
Although the physical properties of perovskite-type
oxides are beyond the scope of this review, a briefaccount of those most relevant to these compoundsis summarized below. The ABO
3perovskites display
several interesting physical properties such as fer-roelectricity (BaTiO
3), ferromagnetism (SrRuO 3), weak
ferromagnetism (LaFeO 3), superconductivity (YBa 2-
Cu3O7), large thermal conductivity due to exciton
transport (LaCoO 3), insulator-to-metallic transitions
of interest for thermistor applications (LaCoO 3), a
fluorescence compatible with laser action (LaAlO 3:
Nd), and transport properties of interest for high-temperature thermoelectric power (La
2CuO 4).
Magnetic Properties. In the ideal cubic perovskite
structure, each oxygen is shared by two B3+ions,
forming a B -O-B angle of 180°. Such a configuration
is favorable for superexchange interactions betweenmagnetic B
3+cations. This exchange usually results
in antiparallel coupling of nearest-neighbor magneticmoments. When the B
3+ions are in two sublattices
(A2BB′O6) other spin arrangements are possible. If
B′is a diamagnetic ion, the B3+ions are aligned
antiferromagnetically, and the most important ex-change mechanism is believed to be a longer rangesuperexchange interaction through two oxygens ofthe type B -O-B′-O-B. The B -B separation is now
considerably longer than the 0.4 nm separation found
in the ideal perovskite. The LnFeO
3(Ln )lantha-
nide) perovskites are those that have attracted themost attention because of their possible applicationsas technological magnetic materials.
33These com-
pounds show a weak spontaneous magnetic moment,which is attributed to a slight canting of the ironmoments, which are otherwise antiferromagneticallyaligned. The iron moments align in such a way thatthe direction of easy magnetization is along the aor
caxis of the orthorhombic cell. The weak ferromag-
netic moment of 0.03 -0.07 í
B/mol led to the materi-
als being considered for memory devices. Similarly,LnMnO
3shows very interesting magnetic properties.
These manganites containing mostly Mn3+or Mn4+
ions show antiferromagnetic behavior. However, fer-
romagnetic behavior is observed in the range from25 to 35% Mn
4+. A weak magnetic interaction was
found between Mn3+ions, together with a negative
interaction between Mn4+ions and a strong positive
interaction between Mn3+and Mn4+. A similar kind
of behavior was found for the combination of Co3+and
Co4+, but the Cr and Fe compounds were found to be
antiferromagnetic.
Electrical Properties. The electrical conductivity of
perovskites also shows wide variations. Several com-pounds have been used for their dielectric properties,while others show metallic conductivity, althoughmost are semiconductors. As for other compounds,the electrical behavior in perovskites depends on theoutermost electrons, which may be localized at spe-
cific atomic sites or may be collective. Since localizedelectrons may carry a spontaneous moment, there isa strong correlation between the electrical and mag-netic properties of perovskites. Rare-earth perov-skites containing transition ions show widely differ-ing electrical properties.
9For example, LaNiO 3,
which contains nickel in the low-spin state NiIII, and
LaTiO 3exhibit collective d-electron behavior, showing
a metallic conductivity and Pauli paramagnetism. Inthe LnCrO
3(Ln )lanthanide) perovskite series,
LaCrO 3is a semiconductor. For the heavier chromites,
there seem to be two regions of conductivity. In thelow-temperature region, the activation energy in-creases along the lanthanide series (from 0.27 eV forDy to 0.37 eV for Yb), while the high-temperatureregion is characterized by a value of about 0.23 eV.The mechanism of conduction is attributed to thepresence of high mobility Cr
4+ions giving rise to
p-type extrinsic conduction. The decrease in conduc-tivity in the heavier chromites may be related to adecrease in the covalence of the Cr -O bond and an
increased covalence of the Ln-O bond.
9LaMnO 3
perovskite exhibited an abrupt change in conductivityas well as in magnetic susceptibility as a function oftemperature close to 720 K. This behavior wasexplained on the basis that the charge carriers wouldbe holes hopping among localized levels. LaCoO
3
displays an even more complex behavior.9It is a
semiconductor up to about 400 K, after which con-ductivity increases much more rapidly up to 823 K;in the region from 823 to 1200 K it passes through abroad, flat maximum, and, finally, above 1200 K itshows a metal-like behavior. At low temperatures,the Co ions are mainly in the low-spin Co
IIIstate, and
this coexists with the high-spin paramagnetic Co3+
state at higher temperatures. As the temperature is
further increased, the Co3+and CoIIIion pairs trans-
form to Co2+and CoIVpairs. Thus, the fraction of Co3+
disappears around 1200 K when only long-range
order is present, resulting in a first-order transition.Along with the spin behavior, the outer electrons alsoshow a transition from the localized to a collectivebehavior. Conductivity can be enhanced considerablyby partial substitution of the lanthanide by a divalention. Thus, for Sr
xLa1-xMnO 3the Mn ions are Mn3+
forx)0. However, an increase in xresults in the
creation of Mn4+holes, thereby increasing conductiv-
ity. For substitutions 0.2 <x<0.4 the system
becomes ferromagnetic and shows a metal -semicon-
ductor transformation. A similar type of behavior wasobserved in Sr-substituted cobaltites.
The electrical properties of perovskites have aroused
special interest since the discovery in 1986 of super-
conductivity at 40 K in cuprates.
5These cuprates are
hole superconductors, exhibiting a mixed valence ofcopper Cu
II-CuIII. Among these, the exception is Ce-
doped Nd 2CuO 4, with Tcclose to 25 K,34which
belongs to a different structural type and is anelectron superconductor. All these compounds havea common feature, the bidimensional character of thestructure, which has been shown to be an importantfactor for the existence of superconductivity at hightemperature.

Optical Properties. Compounds with the perovskite
structure have been used as model systems forspectroscopic studies in the infrared, the visible, andthe ultraviolet. Perovskite oxides (ABO
3) are particu-
larly suited since the effect of magnetic ordering ofthe transition metal ion in the B-site can be studiedin addition to that of the rare earth ion A. Becausethe difference in ordering temperature of the twotypes of ions is large there is little interaction. Theabsorption spectra either for the host ion of theperovskite structure or after incorporation of a low-concentration “probe” into a diamagnetic lattice can
be studied. In the former case of magnetically con-centrated systems, a broad spectrum is obtained,with line widths typically of 0.5 -5c m
-1, while in the
latter a sharp spectrum is obtained, with line widthsof about 0.1 cm
-1. The optical properties of many
ABO 3compounds, in which B is a transition metal
ion with an empty or partially filled d-shell, havebeen explored. For the SrTiO
3perovskite containing
an empty d-shell transition ion (Ti4+), the emission
spectrum shows luminescence which is independentof sample history and contamination and shows aband maximum at about 500 nm, with low quenchingtemperature (35 K) and a small Stokes shift (7000cm
-1). The titanate octahedra sharing corners in
SrTiO 3are favorable for energy band formation. The
broadening of the energy levels of the titanateoctahedron results in a considerably lower energy forthe first absorption transition, and the excited stateof the titanate becomes mobile. This situation hasbeen described as being due to the coexistence of freeand delocalized (self-trapped) excitons.
36A large body
of work on the optical properties of metal ions witha partially filled d-shell containing perovskites exists.Ions with the d
3configuration have been extensively
used to investigate the optical properties of perov-skites. Cr
3+spectroscopy has been studied in perov-
skites MTiO 3(M)Ca, Sr, Ba) and ABO 3(A)La,
Gd, Y; B )Al, Ga). In these systems, the Cr3+ion
may show two completely different types of emission,viz. narrow-line and spin-forbidden emission (
2Ef
4A2) and broad-band and spin-allowed emission
(4T2f4A2), the latter occurring for relatively weak
fields. The transition-metal doped titanates becameof interest after the discovery of photoelectrochemicalwater splitting by titanates.
37It appeared possible
to sensitize an SrTiO 3electrode for visible light by
doping with transition metal ions.38The optical
transitions involved were shown to be of the metal-to-metal charge-transfer type, e.g., Cr
3++Ti4+f
Cr4++Ti3+, which are responsible for the brownish
color of the composition.
D. Adsorption Properties
The identification of the nature and structure of
the exposed sites on the perovskite surfaces as wellas the possible involvement of these sites in catalyticreactions have frequently been studied by the ad-sorption of suitable probe molecules. Both the equi-librium and the kinetics of adsorption and, in somecases, the desorption of molecules from the surfacewere analyzed.1. CO and NO Adsorption
The extent of CO adsorption on LaBO 3(B)
transition metal) perovskites at 298 K was found tobe dependent upon on the electron configuration ofthe B
3+cation and was seen to reach a maximum for
Fe3+,39which mirrors the profile observed for isobutene
adsorption on the same perovskite series. In general,adsorption is fast and the kinetics can be satisfacto-rily described by the Elovich equation.
40Successive
adsorptions of CO 2-CO on LaCrO 3allowed the au-
thors to conclude that CO 2and CO adsorb onto the
site type of surface centers.41By contrast, preadsorp-
tion of O 2followed by CO adsorption revealed that
the extent of CO adsorbed at equilibrium approachedthat measured on a clean surface. This findingindicates that O
2and CO adsorb on different surface
sites.41It was also observed that CO interaction
occurs with surface oxygen and metallic ions.39,41 -44
This is an activated process because the amount of
adsorbed CO increases with the temperature ofadsorption from 298 to 773 K.
NO adsorption at 298 K on a series of LaBO
3oxides
showed maxima for Mn and Co.39The extent of NO
adsorption was found to be independent of temper-ature for LaFeO
345and LaNiO 339over a wide tem-
perature range (273 -673 K). This observation sug-
gests that the nature of the adsorption is not alteredwith temperature. For LaCrO
3,46LaMnO 3,42and
LaRhO 3,47the temperature interval where NO ad-
sorption changes moderately (below 20%) was nar-rower. NO coverage on all these oxides were foundto be of the same order of magnitude as thosemeasured for the simple oxides.
48The infrared spec-
tra of NO adsorbed on the manganite LaMnO 3
showed bands of dinitrosyls and nitrite and nitratespecies.
47This finding indicates that NO molecule
interacts either through Mn3+ions (dinitrosyls) or
through O2-ions (nitrite and nitrates) as illustrated
in the scheme:
Successive NO-CO and CO-NO adsorptions on
LaMO 3at 298 K showed an inhibiting effect of NO
on subsequent CO adsorption, and this was largerthan the inhibiting effect of CO on NO adsorption.
39
NO adsorbs more strongly than CO, in accordancewith previous observations by Yao and Shelef
48for
other perovskites. Consistent with this, comparisonof the thermodynamic parameters for the adsorptionof NO and CO on LaCrO
3revealed higher adsorption
enthalpy and lower adsorption entropy for NO thanfor CO. The almost constancy of the amounts ofadsorbed NO with temperature as well as the strengthof the NO-surface bond are arguments in favor of theuse of NO instead CO for determining metallicsites.
39,42,44,45,47However, the complex IR spectra of
chemisorbed NO39,42,45indicate that there is no
specificity for the adsorption on metal or cation sites,and, therefore, the assumption of a 1:1 stoichiometrybetween NO and B
3+sites may not give a proper
estimate of the density of surface transition-metal
1986 Chemical Reviews, 2001, Vol. 101, No. 7 Pen ˜a and Fierro
sites. Thus, the CO molecule, whose interaction with
B3+ions is weaker than with NO at temperatures
close to ambient, is recommended for evaluating B3+
cations in perovskite oxides.
2. Oxygen Adsorption
Oxygen adsorption on perovskite oxides has been
studied mainly because of the importance of thesecompounds as oxidation -reduction catalysts. The
oxygen adsorption profiles on LaMO
3(M)Cr, Mn,
Fe, Co, Ni) were reported by Kremenic et al.49These
profiles displayed maxima for Mn and Co (Figure 2)that coincide with the maxima observed by Iwamotoet al.
50for the respective single transition metal
oxides (M 2O3) and also for the catalytic activity of
oxidation of this series of perovskites.40It can also
be noted in Figure 3 that the amount of reversibleadsorbed oxygen represents a very small fraction ofthe total adsorption, in agreement with previousfindings.
51
Oxygen TPD peaks from perovskites appeared to
be rather complex. Yamazoe et al.52and Seiyama et
al.53observed two oxygen desorption peaks after
adsorption on La 1-xSrxCoO 3at 1023 K. The low-
temperature peak ( R-type) was ascribed to adsorbed
oxygen, whereas the high-temperature peak ( â-type)was attributed to lattice oxygen. The changes in
intensity of the R-type peak with xin La 1-xSrxMO 3
(M)Mn, Fe, Co) have been interpreted in terms of
the nonstoichiometry and defect structure of theseperovskites.
51,52 -56In a recent contribution, Yokoi and
Uchida57observed that the amount of O 2desorbed
and the temperature of the R-type oxygen desorption
from LaMO 3(M)Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) tended to
decrease with the increasing atomic number of thetransition metal.
57,58The strength of the force pre-
venting O 2desorption was also estimated by model
calculations using the DV-X Rcluster method.59The
calculated bond order for M -O became smaller with
the increasing atomic number of M, which suggeststhat the temperature of O
2desorption during TPD
of O 2was affected by the electronic interaction
between the adsorbed O 2and the transition metal
ion (M3+). The â-type oxygen desorption peak was
found to be more specifically associated with the Mcation, although it is also affected by Ln-site substi-tution.
As a general rule, oxygen adsorption on the per-
ovskite oxide surface is a complex process. As recentlyreported by Au et al.,
60oxygen adsortion is dominated
by a molecular form according to a fast processfollowed by a much slower, activated adsorptionkinetics, associated to formation of oxygen-chargedspecies (O
2f2O2-).
E. Specific Surface and Porosity
Many different methods have been used in the
preparation of perovskite oxides; the choice of aparticular one basically depends on the expectedapplication of these oxides. The application of per-ovskite oxides in the field of heterogeneous catalysisrequires materials with a well-developed porousnetwork. Since this review is mainly concerned withthe surface and catalytic properties of perovskites,emphasis is placed on the specific area and porosityof powdered samples. Preshaped perovskite oxides inhoneycomb type structures and highly ordered thinfilms are also briefly examined.
Classical methods of the preparation of perovskite
oxides include: (i) equimolecular oxide mixing syn-thesis and (ii) decomposition synthesis. Type i methodrequires a high calcination temperature (1300 -1500
K) for the solid state reaction to occur and oftenresults in the formation of coarse aggregation. Thegrain size of the powder obtained by this method isrelatively large and the specific area is too small,making it unsuitable for catalytic applications. An-other major drawback of this method is that thepurity of the product is not high. Type ii method,however, requires lower synthesis temperatures,usually below 1100 K; thus high purity and homo-geneity of the product are attainable. The differencesbetween methods i and ii were clearly shown byBerndt et al.
61These authors found that the solid-
state reaction of mixtures of separately precipitatedhydroxides proceeded much faster than that of physi-cal mixtures of single oxides (ceramic method).
Spray-drying, freeze-drying, and coprecipitation
methods are simple techniques for preparing ag-glomeration-free submicrometer powders, with high

purity, controlled stoichiometry, crystallinity, and
relatively narrow particle-size distribution. Thesethree methods were compared in the preparation ofsubstituted manganites of the type La
1-xMxMnO 3
(M)Sr, K, Pb, Ce, Co, Ni, Mg, Li).62The former
method yielded solids with some compositional seg-regation and specific areas below 17 m
2/g, while the
latter led to well-crystallized oxides, with specificareas smaller than 10 m
2/g. Even larger specific areas
were obtained with freeze-drying because of the lowertemperature required in the calcination step.
Some novel low-temperature preparation methods
include carbonate,
63hydroxide,64,65cyanide, and mixed
nitrate decomposition,63,64oxalate coprecipitation,
and urea homogeneous precipitation followed bythermal decomposition,
66as well as the sol -gel
processes using citric acid67poly(acrylic acid),68poly-
(ethylene glycol),69,70poly(vinyl alcohol),71malic acid,72
and stearic acid73as the media for protecting the
colloidal particles. However, the powders preparedby most of these methods still have low specific areas,usually below 10 m
2/g, except that the sol -gel
methods yield well-crystallized samples with largerspecific areas (11 -20 m
2/g) mainly because the
calcination temperatures are as low as 823 -923 K,
i.e., 200 -300 K lower than that used in the carbonate
process.63Among the sol -gel processes, the use of
stearic acid in the preparation offers the possibilityof synthesizing high purity homogeneous nanocom-posites with relatively larger specific areas at reason-
ably low processing temperatures.
74Following this
method for the preparation of LaCoO 3perovskite, the
synthesis conditions can easily be controlled, andcrystalline structures are obtained at temperaturesas low as 773 -873 K. The ultrafine perovskite
particles (20 -70 nm) are spherical, of uniform size,
and have specific areas higher than 30 m
2/g, sub-
stantially higher than that obtained by the conven-tional methods.
The hysteresis loops of the adsorption isotherms
recorded on samples prepared by freeze-drying andexplosion methods belong to the A-type according tode Boer’s classification,
75while the adsorption iso-
therms of the samples prepared by ceramic andcoprecipitation methods give type B-loops. This cleardifferentiation proves that the porous texture of thepowdered samples is strongly dependent on thepreparation method. It seems worth mentioning thatsome powdered perovskites showed stepwise adsorp-tion isotherms. Since the adsorption of different probemolecules on oxide surfaces pointed to the existenceof an energetically heterogeneous surface, it appearedthat step formation in these systems must be due tolateral interactions of adsorbed nitrogen moleculesrather than to the presence of a homogeneous sur-face.
76
Flat perovskite surfaces can readily be obtained by
epitaxial thin film growth on well-defined sub-strates.
77-81Of particular interest is the SrTiO 3
perovskite that serves as a substrate for growing
oxide superconducting films.82,83Tanaka et al.81
studied the atomic configuration and chemical prop-erties of a SrO- and TiO
2-terminated SrTiO 3(001)
surface produced by laser molecular beam epitaxy(MBE) using an atomic force microscope (AFM) with
a surface-modified tip. Both terminated surfacesdisplayed a terrace structure consisting of an atomi-cally flat plane and steps of height 0.4 nm corre-sponding to the unit cell step. When measured usinga TiO
2-coated tip, the friction force of the SrO-
terminated surface was found to be larger than thatof the TiO
2-terminated surface. This suggests that
the forced friction would be caused by the bondingenergy present at the interface, which provides amethod for measuring the chemical energy presentin oxide compounds of the nanometer order betweenthe surface and the tip of the microscope.
Chemical vapor deposition was also used for the
preparation of dense perovskite films, i.e., nonvolatilerandom access memory ferroelectrics, possessing anextremely low porosity.
84,85Other approaches con-
sisted of the epitaxial growth of a thick perovskitelayer on an ordered substrate. The epitaxial thin filmof the ordered double Sr
2FeMoO 6perovskite has been
successfully prepared on SrTiO 3(001) and (111)
substrates by pulsed laser deposition in a narrowwindow of temperature and oxygen pressure.
79The
diffraction patterns of the (111) oriented film exhib-ited the reflection peaks of a double perovskite unitcell ( a
o0.8 nm), indicating B-site ordering. The in
situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction pat-tern revealed clear 2-fold superstructure correspond-ing to the double perovskite unit cell. The surfacetopology of these films was revealed by atomic force
microscopy. The (001) oriented film showed an atomic-scale step-and-terrace structure. The step height wasabout 0.4 nm, which corresponds to single perovskiteunit cell height. This agrees with the expectation forthe Sr
2FeMoO 6: each perovskite sheet is equivalent
and includes the same number of FeO 6and MoO 6
octahedra arranged like a checkerboard. Since thedirection of the steps is almost identical in the entireregion of the sample, the structure should reflect thesurface steps of the SrTiO
3substrate, as also ob-
served for (La,Sr)MnO 3films.86On the other hand,
the (111) ordered oriented film displayed triangular-shaped grains. A spiral structure of atomic-scalesteps was observed on the grains, indicating that thegrowth mode of the film is two-dimensional spiralgrowth mediated by screw dislocation. It was ob-served that the height of each step was about 0.45nm, which corresponds to the (111) d-spacing of the
Sr
2FeMoO 6unit cell and half of this. This implies that
the growth of the (111) oriented film takes place withthe chemical formula as a growth unit and that thereexists a preferred surface termination of the B-sitecation.
The atomic layered perovskite films reported here
are excellent model surfaces to investigate chemicalreactions between adsorbed molecules at atomicscale. Atomic force microscopy becomes an extremelyuseful tool not only to investigate the topology of thesurface at very high resolution but also to developspecific adsorbed molecule-surface site locations,which opens the possibility of investigating chemicalreactions on the catalytic surfaces.
Since perovskites had demonstrated excellent per-
formance in exhaust treatment (see section IV.B), it1988 Chemical Reviews, 2001, Vol. 101, No. 7 Pen ˜a and Fierro
was believed that they could be supported on an inert
ceramic substrate such as cordierite (2Al 2O3â5SiO 2â
2MgO), as already done in the three-way catalystsused in the car engine exhaust gases. In the firstattempts
87to deposit a perovskite layer on a cor-
dierite monolith, the procedure basically includeddipping the ceramic monolith in an aqueous slurryof powdered perovskite, followed by drying and firingto bind the perovskite to the surface. It was foundthat in alumina-based monoliths the decrease incatalytic performance might partly be due to a solid-state reaction between the perovskite and the alu-mina substrate. An approach used by Mizuno et al.
88
to circumvent reaction of the active phase (La 0.8Sr0.2-
CoO 3) with a high specific area substrate consists of
precoating the cordierite with a La 2O3layer. A
maximum in activity for the combustion of propeneat 673 K was observed for 18% La
2O3incorporated,
which correlates well with the fraction of the mono-clinic La
2O3phase present. Nudel et al.89used Al 2O3
(25 m2/g) previously stabilized by impregnation with
La(NO 3)3. Subsequent impregnation with an equimo-
lecular solution of Co2+and La3+nitrates, followed
by firing at 1173 K gave rise to a complex solidcontaining ç-Al
2O3, LaAlO 3, CoAl 2O4, and LaCoO 3
phases. This example is a good illustration of the
difficulty involved in obtaining a pure perovskitephase on a reactive substrate.
Recently, Schneider et al.
90prepared La 0.84Sr0.16-
Mn 0.67Co0.33O3perovskite-coated and perovskite-
extruded monolith catalysts and tested the combus-tion of several aliphatic chlorinated hydrocarbons.The coated monolith catalysts were prepared by atwo-step procedure. First, the monolith cordieriteceramic support was impregnated with a solutioncontaining appropriate amounts of the correspondingnitrates. After air-calcination at 873 K, the impreg-nated monoliths were coated with a bulk perovskite-water suspension. Then, the dried sample was againcalcined at 873 K. The perovskite-extruded monolithswere prepared by extrusion of a mixture of precipi-tated perovskites and a cordierite precursor in mono-
lith form. A rather high specific area (57 m
2/g) was
obtained after calcination at 823 K. Honeycombmonolith perovskite catalysts were prepared by Ciam-belli et al.
91from ultradispersed powders of mixed
oxides of rare-earth metals (La-Ce or Dy-Y) andtransition metals (Ni, Fe, Mn) by mechanochemicalmethods. The honeycombs were then obtained byextrusion of plastic pastes of the perovskite powdersand additives. The best performance for methanecombustion was exhibited by La-Ni oxides-containingmonoliths that, in turn, display the highest porevolume and fraction of macropores (20% above 1 ím).
Other preshaped structures such as foams
92and
silica -alumina fibers93have been used as support of
perovskites. Podyacheva et al.92employed Ni and Ni-
Cr foam substrates to deposit a LaCrO 3perovskite
phase. In both cases, preliminary washcoating of themetal surface was required in both cases to facilitatethe anchorage of the perovskite phase. The perovskitewas the only phase detected by diffraction methodsand was stable upon calcination up to 1273 K. In arecent contribution, Klvana et al.
93prepared Ni-Co-based perovskites supported on a commercial silica -
alumina fiber blanket. The system was particularlysuitable for use in the combustion of lean natural gasmixtures. The perovskite deposit (12 -15%) was
achieved by incipient wetting of the fiber blanketwith the precursor solution, followed by fast freezingof the solution wet blanket by immersion in liquidnitrogen and vacuum-drying. These systems exhib-ited activities comparable to those of commercialfiber-supported platinum and were found to be stableat temperatures below 1000 K.
F. Thermal Stability in a Reducing Atmosphere
The thermal stability of perovskites is determined
by the cations at position A and also at position B.Arakawa et al.
94showed that the extent of H 2-
reduction of cobalt in LnCoO 3(Ln )lanthanide)
increased from Ln )La to Ln )Eu, i.e., with
decreasing ionic radius of the lanthanide element.The same reduction sequence was observed by Futaiet al.,
95although the perovskites of Gd, Tb, and Dy
were less reducible. These later authors also reporteda direct relationship between the reducibility and thesum of the energies of the Ln-O and Co-O bonds; i.e.,the ease of reduction increases with decreasingmetal -oxygen bond energy. On the other hand, the
stability in hydrogen of LaFeO
3and LaRhO 3was
found to be higher than that of the correspondingyttrium perovskites.
96
In a systematic study of the Gibbs free energy of
formation ( ¢G°) of several ferrates from the starting
metal oxides: Fe 2O3+Ln2O3f2 LnFeO 3,i nt h e
temperature range from 1150 to 1300 K, Katsura etal.
97found a linear relationship between the values
of¢G° and the Goldschmidt tolerance factor ( t). That
is,¢G° becomes more negative with increasing values
oftor increasing ionic radius of the lanthanide cation.
A similar relationship was observed for the ¢G°o f
formation of LnFeO 3oxides starting from metallic
iron, Ln 2O3, and oxygen at 1470 -1570 K.98All these
results clearly indicate that the stability of theperovskite structure increases with increasing sizeof the lanthanide ion in the temperature intervalstudied and are consistent with those of Arakawa etal.
94for LnCoO 3oxides.
Partial substitution of the A ion by another ion of
a lower oxidation state such as Sr (La 1-xSrxCoO 3) may
also induce important changes in stability. Withincreasing the values of x, the concentration of
unstable Co
4+and/or of oxygen vacancies also in-
crease, which favors the diffusion of lattice oxygenfrom the bulk to surface, as charge compensators.Thus, increasing the strontium content in the defec-tive structure of La
1-xSrxCoO 3accounts for the un-
stability of the lattice in a reducing environment.51
In contrast, the stability of the hole-doped La 0.8Th0.2-
CoO 3perovskite is higher than that of LaCoO 3
because part of the cobalt is present as Co2+.99
The thermal stability of perovskite oxides was
found to depend also on the type of cation at the Bposition. Nakamura et al.
100studied the structural
changes of a series of LaBO 3(B)V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co,
Ni) oxides induced by H 2-reduction at 1273 K as a
function of the oxygen partial pressure. Among theChemical Structures and Performance of Perovskite Oxides Chemical Reviews, 2001, Vol. 101, No. 7 1989
crystalline products produced by reduction, the dis-
mutation La 2MO 4phases were detected, with the
exception of La 2MnO 4, which is unstable at temper-
atures above 1200 K.101Other possible intermediate
reduced mixed oxides such as La 2Co2O5,L a 2Ni2O5,
and LaNiO 2phases were not observed because they
are unstable. The following order of stability in termsof the -log P
O2values can be established: LaNiO 3<
LaCoO 3<LaMnO 3<LaFeO 3<LaCrO 3LaVO 3.
This order parallels the Madellung constant exceptfor LaNiO
3and LaCoO 3, which show higher con-
stants. The origin of this discrepancy may be theexistence of stable La
2MO 4compounds for Ni and Co.
Crystal structures of titanium (SrTiO 3, BaTiO 3)102
and chromium (LaCrO 3)103perovskites exhibited a
very high stability after being exposed to a reducingatmosphere at temperatures as high as 1200 K.Other perovskites containing reducible first transi-tion row ions in their structure underwent importantcrystalline and chemical transformations after lesssevere treatments. An exhaustive account of this wasoffered in our previous review.
104For example, Cres-
pin and Hall102found that the crystal structure of
LaCoO 3is slightly altered upon quantitative H 2-
reduction of Co3+to Co2+. However, the diffraction
pattern of the perovskite in which Co3+is quantita-
tively reduced to metallic cobalt shows only thediffraction lines of La
2O3, indicating that highly
dispersed metallic Co0would remain trapped in the
La2O3phase. This was already confirmed by sintering
the metallic Co0phase upon heating at 1073 K in an
He atmosphere, then after which the diffraction linesof metallic Co particles appeared.
In a recent study on the reduction -oxidation of
LnCoO
3(Ln )La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd) perovskites,105it
was demonstrated that cobalt reduction occurs in twosteps: near 633 K (Co
3+to Co2+) and at 783 -845 K
(Co2+to Co0), the maximum of the second peak
decreasing from La to Gd. Diffraction studies re-vealed that the perovskite NdCoO
3is reduced in two
steps, first to NdCoO 2.5and then further to Co0/
Nd 2O3, and in both stages it was demonstrated that
the reoxidation with oxygen is capable of recoveringthe perovskite structure. Temperature-programmedoxidation with reduced LnCoO
1.5systems indicated
that the reoxidation of cobalt also takes place in twosteps: first by oxidation of the supported Co
0to the
spinel Co 3O4followed by a further oxidation of Co2+
to Co3+, with a simultaneous solid-state reaction with
Ln2O3, regenerating the perovskite structure. The
nature of the Ln affects the stability of the perovskiteLnCoO
3. The Goldschmidt tolerance factor ( t) for
these perovskites indicates that, considering onlygeometric factors, lanthanum, the largest lanthanideion in the series, forms the most stable perovskitestructure. This and other examples mentioned aboveshow that by reduction treatments or redox cycles,the metal in position B remains in a high degree ofdispersion on a matrix of the Ln
2O3oxide. Consider-
ing the importance of dispersed metals in heteroge-neous catalysis, the reduction or reduction -oxidation
of perovskites under controlled conditions may offera promising methodology for the preparation ofhighly active catalysts.III. Acid−Base and Redox Properties
In this section, two important properties of per-
ovskite-type oxides directly related to catalytic per-formance such as acid -base and redox are examined
briefly. Since the surface of perovskites may beprimarily related to their catalytic properties, thenature and concentration of the surface sites can beevaluated by analysis of the interactions of suitableprobe molecules and the surfaces of these oxides. Acidsites in perovskite-type oxides have been investigatedby adsorption of a basic molecule such as pyridine,whereas basic sites have been evaluated by adsorp-tion of acid molecules such as carbon dioxide. Fur-thermore, the reduction of perovskites and the oxy-gen adsorption-reaction on their surfaces play acentral role in the catalytic activity of oxygen-mediated reactions.
104,106
A. Acidity and Basicity
Acid sites in perovskite oxides have been deter-
mined by adsorption of pyridine. The infrared spectraof pyridine adsorbed on LaMnO
3and LaFeO 3at room
temperature107exhibited bands at 1595, 1490, and
1440 cm-1, due to the vibration modes of the pyridine
bonded to Lewis sites. Pyridine adsorbed on theLaCrO
3sample108showed similar bands but of lower
intensity suggesting the presence of a smaller con-centration of acid Lewis sites.
A similar spectrum to that of the unreduced samples
was recorded upon pyridine adsorption on H
2-reduced
LaBO 3oxides, exhibited similar infrared spectra
together with a weak Bro ¨nsted band at 1540 -1545
cm-1. The intensity of this later band increased
slightly upon adsorption of water at 423 K. Theincrease in Bro ¨nsted acidity can be understood by
assuming that water molecules adsorb dissociativelyon pairs of surface acid -base sites (O
2-ions). The
band at 1490 -1495 cm-1is related to the pyridine
adsorbed on coordinatively unsaturated exposed cat-ions, which constitute Lewis acid sites. The presenceof La
3+and M3+ions in these perovskites with very
different charge/radius ratios probably generates acidsites of markedly different strength. In any case, theweak intensity of the infrared bands of adsorbedpyridine and the removal of these bands upon out-gassing at 673 -873 K point to a low acidic character
of these oxides.
107
It has been observed that calcined, and specifically
H2-reduced, perovskite surfaces exposed to water
vapor enhances the hydroxyl groups concentration.103
The infrared hydroxyl groups spectra recorded uponwater adsorption at 423 K on oxidic and reducedLaCrO
3samples gave bands, in both cases at 3680
cm-1, of isolated OH groups (site I) and at 3550 cm-1
of acid OH groups (site II). The adsorption and
dissociation of water was assumed to take place onpairs of surface acid -base sites, yielding an acidic
OH and an anion vacancy placed between coordina-Bro¨nsted site: MO-H+: N(C5H5)
Lewis site: OM: N(C5H5)1990 Chemical Reviews, 2001, Vol. 101, No. 7 Pen ˜a and Fierro
tively unsaturated La3+and reduced metal ions (M2+
or M+) (site I) and a basic OH-on a coordinatively
unsaturated oxygen ion bonded to a La or M ion (siteII). As the dissociation of water takes places even onthe oxidic samples, this suggests that during theoutgassing step some O
2-vacancies are generated on
the surface, although presumably at a low concentra-tion, as above. In addition, the formation of thesevacancies is strongly enhanced by H
2treatment,
which favors water dissociation on the reducedsurface.
Many perovskite oxides exhibit basic properties
which can be used to conduct several catalytic reac-tions.
104Among the methods proposed to measure
surface basicity the adsorption of benzoic acid (Bro ¨n-
sted basicity) and more specifically CO 2adsorption -
desorption experiments109-111remain prominent. The
extent of CO 2adsorption as well as the heats of
adsorption on LaBO 3(B)Cr, Fe, Co) oxides were
studied over a wide temperature range by Tejucaet al.
112,113The CO 2coverage follows the order
LaCrO 3>LaFeO 3>LaCoO 3. Activated adsorption
was found to occur at temperatures above 420 K onLaCrO
3and LaCoO 3; however, the extent of CO 2
adsorption on LaFeO 3decreased continuously with
increasing temperature. A modelistic analysis of theequilibrium data of CO
2adsorption allowed to sat-
isfactorily describe isotherms by the Freundlichmodel of adsorption. Sets of data of CO
2adsorption
and that of other simple molecules led the authorsto propose the Freundlich equation as an additionaltool to evaluate specific areas of metal oxides andperovskites.
108
Because CO 2is a slightly acid molecule its adsorp-
tion on basic sites is strong. Upon CO 2adsorption
on BaTiO 3114and LaMO 3(M)Cr, Mn, Fe, Co,
Ni)107,108,112,113perovskites and monodentate and bi-
dentate carbonates are formed. The former carbon-ates are favored at low temperatures, and in somecases transformation of these species into bidentatecarbonates with increasing temperatures was ob-served. The broad carbonate infrared bands
provide evidence of the presence of energetically
different adsorption sites. On LaFeO
3,C O 2adsorp-
tion gives rise to infrared bands of carbonates at1600, 1325, 1218, 1050, and 840 cm
-1. The former
two bands decrease in intensity upon reductiontreatments, suggesting that they are associated withmonodentate structures.
113The opposite trend ob-
served for the band at 1050 cm-1points to the
formation of a carbonate of higher thermal stability,such as bidentate species. Finally, the band at 1218cm
-1can be associated to a very labile carbonate
since it was removed by outgassing at room temper-ature.
113
CO 2temperature-programmed desorption (TPD)
measurements were also used to evaluate surfacebasicity in perovskites. TPD profiles after CO
2ad-
sorption on LaBO 3oxides revealed two major peaksat 340 -425 K and 540 -920 K.107,108,112,113,115The peak
at 340 -425 K originates from the decomposition of
a monodentate carbonate, the least stable CO 2ad-
sorbed species. However, the CO 2desorption peak at
540-920 K probably arises from the decomposition
of bidentate and/or bridged carbonates, whose pres-ence was also revealed by infrared spectroscopy. Amechanism for the formation of this type of specieshas been advanced and consists of pair sites includinga lattice oxygen and an anion vacancy. Support tothis interpretation is provided by experiments on theadsorption of CO
2on partially reduced samples in
which the concentration of these carbonates in-creased with the extent of oxide reduction.
107,112,113
The high-temperature desorption peak after CO 2
adsorption on reduced LaCoO 344and LaNiO 3111
samples was quite different from that of the other
perovskite oxides. The intensity of the CO 2desorption
peaks showed maxima for prereduced LaCoO 3and
LaNiO 3samples at 573 K and then decreases at
higher reduction temperatures. This finding suggestsan interaction of bidentate or bridged carbonates withintermediate reduction states of cobalt and nickel,such as Co
2+and Ni2+.
Petit et al.116prepared tin-containing ASnO 3(A)
Ca, Sr, Ba) perovskites by a sol -gel method starting
from an oxide (SnO) or from chlorinated precursors(SnCl
4) and used them in the oxidative coupling of
methane. They found that 10 times more CO 2is
adsorbed on BaSnO 3ex-oxide than on BaSnO 3ex-
chloride. This difference agrees with other findingsin the literature
107-111,116,117concerning other cata-
lysts. Since the specific areas of the two catalystswere similar, the extent of CO
2adsorption can
therefore not be directly attributed to it. As shownin Figure 3, the shape of CO
2TPD profiles strongly
depends on the precursors used in the preparationof the two perovskites. Peaks below 470 K, veryintense for ex-oxide and weak for the ex-chloridesample, were assigned to weakly adsorbed CO
2.
Other peaks located in the 500 -750 K temperature
range were attributed to strongly adsorbed carbon-ates,
110whereas peaks at 860 K (ex-oxide) and 910
K (ex-chloride) corresponded to the decomposition ofbulk carbonates. CO
2, which is a poison for the
coupling reaction, is less strongly adsorbed on thecatalyst ex-chloride. Thus, chlorine appears to sta-bilize the sites that are active in the coupling reactionwith respect to the poisoning by CO
2.
B. Redox Processes
The reduction and oxygen adsorption properties of
several LaBO 3(B)first-row transition element)
perovskite oxides41,49,118conclusively demonstrated
that these parameters are directly involved in thecatalytic activity of these oxides for oxidation reac-tions. It was observed that the more easily reducibleperovskite oxides (LaNiO
3, LaCoO 3, and LaMnO 3)
resulted in better catalysts for oxidation reactionsthan the less reducible one (LaCrO
3).118Because of
the importance of this, the kinetics and mechanismsof the reduction of some perovskite oxides werebriefly examined. Attention was also paid on theoxidation rates of prereduced samples. Additionally,
Chemical Structures and Performance of Perovskite Oxides Chemical Reviews, 2001, Vol. 101, No. 7 1991
a brief account on the differences in oxygen content
of the perovskite structure brought about by reduc-tion-oxidation cycles is also given in this section.
1. Kinetics and Mechanisms
Analysis of the reduction profiles of perovskites
oxides provides useful information for interpretingthe reduction mechanism of these materials. Thesemechanisms can be studied by recording kinetic dataunder isothermal conditions. To illustrate this meth-odology, the temperature-programmed reduction (TPR)profiles of a PrCoO
3perovskite oxide are shown in
Figure 4a.119The reduction profile shows that the
overall reduction Co3+fCo0occurs in two steps: (i)
reduction of Co3+to Co2+(PrCoO 3+1/2H2fPrCoO 2.5)
at temperatures near 660 K and (ii) reduction of Co2+
to Co0(PrCoO 2.5+H2f1/2Pr2O3+Co0) at temper-
atures about 800 K.
An in-depth analysis of families of kinetic curves
of reduction, each one recorded at constant temper-ature, results extremely valuable to understand themechanisms involved in the reduction of these mixedoxides. The plot of the reduction degree ( R) versus
the time of reduction ( t) for the first step in Figure
4b shows that the reduction rate decreases continu-ously with time, indicating that the reduction of theperovskite oxide particles occurs according to thecontracting-sphere model. The reduction starts witha very fast nucleation rate, which results in thecomplete saturation of the grains by a thin layer ofthe reduced phase after which the rate is attenuateduntil the bulk reduction is completed. This mecha-nism implies a continuous drop of the rate of thereduction until the unreduced phase in the core ofthe grains has been consumed in the reaction. Thereduction process can be precisely described by theMampel’s law:
120where Ris the reduction degree (if determined by
microgravimetry, it is the ratio between the experi-mental weight change and the theoretical one for acomplete reduction); kand bare constants; n)2
corresponds to a two-dimensional growth, and n)3
to a three-dimensional growth of the reduction layer.This equation holds over the middle range of R
values.
Kinetic experiments for the deep reduction of Co
2+
to Co0in PrCoO 3(Figure 4c) within the temperature
range from 716 to 784 K showed, as expected, a fastreduction corresponding to the reduction of Co
3+to
Co2+, which is then followed by a slower reduction.
The reduction curves showed a sigmoidal shape forthe second reduction step and the extent of reductioncorresponds to the quantitative reduction of Co
2+into
metallic Co0(Co2++H2fCo0). Thus, the reduction
of Co2+to Co0is controlled by the formation and
growth of metallic reduction nuclei on the surface ofthe reduced phase in step a (nucleation model). Whenreduction starts, the rate increases because of thegrowth of nuclei already formed and the appearanceof new ones. Once the surface has become coveredby these reduction nuclei, they overlap to a certainextent. Thus, at the inflection point of the curves ofreduction both the interface of the oxidized andreduced phases and the rate of reduction begin todecrease. This process can be described by theAvrami -Erofeyev equation:
121
where n,k, and Rhave the same meaning as in eq 2,
which holds over Rvalues from 0.05 to 0.95.
For LaNiO 3perovskite, the kinetic reduction curves
were virtually the same as that of PrCoO 3.121How-
ever, for LaFeO 3and LaRhO 3the cation at the
B-position is reduced the metal, following the con-tracting-sphere model. For the substituted LaFe
x-
Ni1-xO3+äsamples, reducibility was found to depend
strongly on x122(Figure 5a). LaFeO 3+äexhibited
oxidativenonstoichiometry, with the principal reduc-tion step associated with the reduction of Fe
3+to Fe0
taking place at temperatures of about 1000 K.23
There was also a small reduction in the 500 -700 K
range due to the nonstoichiometry of the oxide(oxygen excess and Fe
4+). The oxygen excess ( ä)
0.05) was lower than that previously reported for thesame perovskite prepared at lower temperature,
23
since ädecreased with the calcination temperature.
Substitution with Ni led to a decrease in the reduc-tion temperature, which changed from 1000 K forx)1t o6 5 0Kf o r x)0( N i
2+fNi0). For the partially
substituted (0.15 exe0.75) samples, this latter peak
overlaps with the reduction of Fe3+into metallic Fe0.
Additionally, a first reduction step appeared in therange 450 -500 K (Ni
3+fNi2+).
The kinetic curves of reduction at three different
temperatures (726, 749, and 784 K) for LaFe 0.1-
Ni0.9O3122are shown in Figure 5b. For the sake of
simplicity, only kinetic curves in the temperatureregion where Ni
3+is reduced to Ni2+are included.
The sigmoidal shape of these curves indicates that

ture programmed reduction (4 K/min); (b,c) isothermalreduction in the first (1 e

the process of reduction can be reasonably described
by the shell-type contracting model, which is math-ematically described by the Mampel equation (eq 2).The maximum rate of the reduction can be ap-proached to the reciprocal of the time required toachieve a 50% reduction ( r
max∝1/t0.5). Thus, activation
energies ( Ea) were calculated by means of the Arrhe-
nius plot of ln(1/ t0.5) against 1/ T. The Eavalues found
for the temperature windows of 490 -580 K (Ni3+f
Ni2+) and 726 -784 K (Ni2+fNi0) are 103 and 111
kJ mol-1, respectively.122
It should be emphasized here that the distinction
of the two reduction mechanisms is somewhat arbi-trary because the contracting-sphere model accountsfor a rapid nucleation process and the nucleationmechanism ends according to a contracting-spheremodel. This observation is illustrated by the closesimilarity of the shape of the curves of reduction afterthe inflection point in step b in Figure 4c and in stepa in Figure 4b.
2. Reduction −Oxidation Cycles
Perovskite oxides may be reversibly reduced and
oxidized at temperatures at which sintering of thereduced or oxidized phases is absent. This is il-lustrated by LaCoO
3perovskite. For this sample,
reoxidation at 673 K of LaCoO 3previously reduced
to Co0+La2O3fully restores the perovskite structure.
However, the reduced phases Co0+La2O3heated in
an inert atmosphere (He) at 1073 K and reoxidationas above did not restore the original perovskite phase.
Instead, a Co 3O4phase was formed.102The irrevers-
ibility in the redox cycle is mainly caused by thedrastic increase in the crystal size of cobalt particlesbrought about by thermal treatment at high temper-atures. A similar increase in Ni
0metal particle size
was observed upon reduction of LaNiO 3at 703 K
followed by heating in He up to 1173 K; this provedto be greater than one order of magnitude.
121The
intermediate reduction products La nNinO2n+1(Ni2+)
and LaNiO 2(Ni+) were fully oxidized by O 2at 453
K.123This result is similar to that observed for the
reduction at 773 K of LaCoO 3to Co0+La2O3followed
by reoxidation with pure O 2at 673 K.102Under these
conditions, important amounts of separate phasesCo
3O4and La 2O3as well as LaCoO 3perovskite were
obtained. Formation of the simple oxides of largecrystal size may be avoided by carrying out reoxida-tion of the reduced phases under very mild condi-tions, e.g., at very low oxidation rate by using highlydiluted oxygen (or air) in an inert gas stream as anoxidizing agent. According to this careful operation,the perovskite structure of LaRhO
346and PrCoO 3119
samples was completely restored through reversible
reduction -oxidation cycles. In these two cases,46,119
the crystal size of the regenerated perovskite was
found to be even smaller than that seen for theoriginal samples.
These and other examples already mentioned
above (LaCoO
3102and LaNiO 3123) show that by reduc-
tion treatments or reduction -oxidation cycles, the
metal at position B is in a highly dispersed state ona matrix composed of the oxide at position A. Highlydispersed metals have also been obtained by applyingreduction -oxidation -reduction cycles to supported
metal oxide catalysts.
124,125This methodology is nicely
illustrated by the work of Kobylinski et al.124,125on
the reduction of CoO and NiO phases deposited onceramic substrates. These authors found that catalystactivation through reduction -oxidation -reduction
cycles leads to Co and Ni crystal sizes smaller thanthat obtained through a single reduction process.Since catalyst activity is associated with the metalphase dispersion, combined reduction -oxidation -
reduction cycles may represent a promising pathwayfor the development of highly dispersed metal cata-lysts.
C. Ion Mobility
1. Oxygen Transport
Some perovskite oxides are found to be good mixed-
conducting materials. Owing to their high electronicand ionic conductivity, they can be used as oxygensemipermeable membranes without electrodes orexternal circuits.
126Teraoka et al.127,128were the first
to demonstrate that the oxygen permeation fluxesthrough the LaCoO
3-based perovskites membranes
were 2 -4 orders of magnitude higher than those of
the stabilized zirconia (YSZ) at the same tempera-tures. Ceramic membranes of perovskite-relatedoxide phases La(Sr)Co(Fe)O
3-äwere used success-
fully in several external conditions.129-131The high-
est oxygen permeation fluxes are characteristic of
Figure 5. (a) Temperature-programed reduction (10 K/min)
of LaFe xNi1-xO3+äsamples; (b) kinetic curves of reduction
at different temperatures for LaFe 0.1Ni0.9O3sample.Chemical Structures and Performance of Perovskite Oxides Chemical Reviews, 2001, Vol. 101, No. 7 1993
SrCo 1-xFexO3-äsolid solutions at 0.3 gxg0.2. For
the most SrCoO 3-ä-based perovskites, oxygen perme-
ability is limited by both bulk ionic transport and rateof oxygen exchange between the oxides and the gasphase.
132,133It was found that an increase in oxygen
nonstoichiometry results in decreasing electricalconductivity and oxygen permeability. This effect wasobserved when cobalt was substituted with lowervalence cations in SrCo(M)O
3-ä(M)Ni, Cu) oxide
systems.134,135Conversely, the introduction of copper
into the cobalt sublattice of SrCo(Fe,Cu)O 3-äconsid-
erably improved the sinterability and mechanicalstrength of strontium cobaltites/ferrites.
135
As stated above, Co- or Fe-based perovskites have
mainly been investigated as mixed electronic-oxideionic conductors.
136However, these oxides are easily
reduced in a reducing atmosphere, resulting in theformation of cracks.
137Recently, Ishihara et al.138
found that LaGaO 3-based perovskite doped with a
transition metal cation at the Ga site is effective forincreasing the conductivity of the oxide ion and alsothe oxygen permeation rate. In particular, for
Sr
0.2La0.8Ga1-xNixO3, the oxygen permeation rate
increased with increasing Ni-contents and reacheda maximum at x)0.25 at all temperatures. The
oxygen permeation rate of this sample of 2.2 mL cm
-2
min-1at 1273 K is substantially higher than the
permeation rate of Sr 0.4La0.6Fe0.8Co0.2O3at the same
temperature (1.5 mL cm-2min-1),137which is con-
sidered to be a promising mixed ion conductor foroxygen separation. The improved oxygen permeationrate of the Ni-doped LaGaO
3perovskite is also
accompanied by a stable conductivity and the absenceof Ni reduction in a reducing environment.
The size of the A and B cations in the ABO
3
perovskite structure is an important factor for high
ion conductivity. Using defined potentials, Cherry etal.
139calculated the migration energies of the vacancy
jump for a range of A and B cation radii. The resultsindicated two main points. First, the calculationsexhibited a clear trend toward lower migration ener-gies with smaller A-site cations. There was anoptimum value of about 0.095 nm, below which themigration energy rose steeply. Second, there was adecrease in energy with increasing size of the Bcation, with a minimum at 0.075 nm. To assess theseresults, the relationship between the tolerance factor(t) was also established.
140The calculations suggested
that perovskites with t0.81 may lead to lower
migration energies and faster diffusion, a result withpractical consequences for oxidation catalysis and foroperating fuel cells at lower temperatures and athigher rates. Moreover, this value of the tolerancefactor ( t) would encompass several perovskite elec-
trolytes, such as PrMnO
3and GdMnO 3. These find-
ings can be rationalized in terms of lattice relaxationeffects. As the mobile oxygen approaches the saddlepoint, it must pass through the center of a triangleof cations. Calculations have shown that the repul-sive overlap interactions can be reduced by theoutward relaxation of these cations. It appears thatthe minimum in tvalues corresponds to the most
effective balance of the relaxation of the A and Bcations at the saddle point position. In other words,
the even distribution of relaxation between thecations is an important factor for the low energybarriers to oxygen ion migration.
It has been widely documented that the incorpora-
tion of dopant ions to the LaMO
3oxides is crucial for
promoting catalytic activity and high ion conduc-tivity.
140-144These oxides are commonly acceptor-
doped with low-valent cations (e.g., Sr2+), which
substitute La3+. This reduction of the effective va-
lence of A-site cations leads to the formation of acompensating population of oxygen vacancies at lowoxygen partial pressure, which in turn gives rise tothe observed high ionic conductivity.
The energy of the resulting solution reaction (La-
BO
3+MO fMxLa1-xO3-ä,M )alkaline earth
element) can be evaluated theoretically by combiningappropriate defect and lattice energy terms.
145The
results revealed that the most favorable solutionenergy and hence the highest solubility is expectedfor Sr
2+in all the LaBO 3hosts. The solution energy
was found to be a minimum at Sr2+(close to the La3+
radius of 0.106 nm). This agrees with experimental
studies demonstrating that the incorporation of Sr,and to a lesser extent Ca, results in an increase inthe oxygen diffusion coefficient and to high catalyticactivity in oxidation reactions. Theoretical calcula-tions also showed that the solution of MgO and BaOis somewhat endothermic, in keeping with the ob-served low solubility.
Information about the fundamental mechanistic
features and migration activation energies is limited.It is generally accepted that oxygen diffusion is basedon rapid transport of vacancies, which migrate by aconventional hopping mechanism, although there isno experimental evidence to support this. Thesefactors were analyzed by looking at the potentialenergy surface.
139The surface energy maps were
constructed by calculating the defect energy of themigration ion along the diffusion path and allowingrelaxation of the lattice at each position. Accordingto this calculation, the results confirmed the migra-tion of oxygen ion vacancies as the lowest energypath. The calculated migration activation energy forLaMnO
3was 0.86 eV, in agreement with the value
of 0.73 eV reported by Belzner et al.146Similarly, the
activation energy for LaCoO 3was 0.61 eV, which is
in good agreement with the experimental valuemeasured by Carter et al.
147The location of ions and
the available space in the perovskite lattice suggestthat interstitial diffusion is unlikely. This is cor-roborated by the high-energy barriers ( >1.5 eV)
calculated for the interstitial migration. Therefore,the ion diffusion in perovskite-type LaBO
3comes
from the mobility of oxygen ion vacancies.
2. Cation Transport
Despite the extensive work devoted to oxygen
transport, little efforts have been devoted to inves-tigating cation diffusion in perovskite oxides. Cationmobility plays an important role not only in theprocessing steps, but also in their operation anddegradation. Thus, it is believed that in membraneperovskites cation mobilities occur in such a way that1994 Chemical Reviews, 2001, Vol. 101, No. 7 Pen ˜a and Fierro
the high oxygen pressure side favors enrichment with
the fast moving of cations.148
For manganites, lanthanum diffusion is likely to
take place by vacancy migration between neighboringsites. The values of the activation energies for thisLa vacancy mechanism calculated by Islam
149indi-
cate a value of 3.93 eV for the cubic structure with aclear trend toward higher energies as the perovskitelattice becomes more distorted from the cubic struc-ture. This fact is associated with the Mn -O-Mn
bending and MnO
6octahedra tilting. The calculations
reveal a correlation between the shortest O -O sepa-
ration across the octahedral interstice and the acti-vation energy for La migration.
149As expected, this
activation energy increases as the O -O distance
decreases. It should be stressed that the predictedvalue for the vacancy mechanism is consistent withthe calculated activation energy of 4.70 eV forLaGaO
3150and the experimental value of 4.98 eV for
La diffusion in the solid-oxide electrolyte fuel cellinterconnect LaCrO
3perovskite.151
The calculated migration energies for Mn migra-
tion are extremely high, lying around 14 eV, althoughin this case the perovskite distortion does not alterthe energy barrier.
149Working on Sr-substituted
manganites, Sr xLa1-xMnO 3+ä, Wofenstine et al.150
calculated activation energies on the order of 4 -5e V
for bulk self-diffusion, although these authors wereunable to assign these values to a given cationdiffusion. By modeling cation transport in Ca- and
Sr-substituted manganites, in which the divalentdopant cations are compensated by electron holes(Mn
4+sites), it was found that the migration energies
decrease in the order La >Sr>Ca.149This trend is,
in principle, unexpected because the ionic radius ofLa
3+lies between that of Sr2+and Ca2+. It can be
explained assuming that electrostatic and ion polar-izibility factors, as well as steric hindrance at thesaddle point, are important.
Recently, perovskite oxides have received great
deal of attention as high-temperature proton conduc-tors with promising applications in several fields suchas hydrogen sensors, fuel cells, and electrolyzers.
152
The best studied perovskites for this purpose areA
2+B4+O3, particularly ACeO 3(A)Sr, Ba)153,154and
AZrO 3(A)Ca, Sr),155with only a few studies on
A3+B3+O3oxides.156As revealed by isotope effect (H +/
D+) analysis of perovskite oxides, the conduction
mechanism is due to proton hopping between adja-cent oxygen ions, rather than by hydroxyl ion migra-tion. Proton jump involves quantum effects (tunnel-ing) and cooperative motions of the structure (latticephonons), both leading to modulations of O -O dis-
tance. Using ab initio Harthree -Fock techniques,
Cherry et al.
139studied the proton-transfer process
and calculated energy barriers for proton conductivi-ties of less than 0.2 eV, which are 2 -3 times lower
than that observed in perovskite oxides.
153-156It
should be emphasized that these calculations yieldthe energy and geometry of the ground and barrierstate configurations. However, they provide no in-formation concerning the relaxation of the surround-ing lattice, which would accompany the proton mi-gration.IV. Heterogeneous Catalysis
A. Oxidation Reactions
1. CO Oxidation
The oxidation of CO over perovskite oxides was
taken as a probe reaction on a number of perovskiteoxides with the aim of correlating the observedactivity with electronic state of the transition metalions or the defect chemistry of these compounds.
104,157
In LnBO 3(Ln )lanthanide) perovskites, the Ln3+
ions are essentially inactive in catalysis and the
active M3+transition metal ions are located at
relatively large distances from each other (around 0.4nm), which make them excellent catalytic models forstudy the interactions of CO and O
2on single surface
sites.
The first study on the CO oxidation on perovskite
oxides was carried out by Parravano in the early50s.
158Later on, Kawai et al.115observed a disconti-
nuity in the activation energy for the oxidation of COwith O
2or N 2O on BaTiO 3ferroelectrics near the
Curie temperature ( Tc)393 K) of this catalyst. The
reaction rate is very slow in the temperature rangefrom 373 to 473 K and under steady-state conditionsis limited by the rate of the desorption of CO
2. Both
facts were taken as conclusive that the oxidationreaction proceeds via surface defects. Many otherperovskite oxides have been proposed and used in COoxidation. Looking at most of the works discussed inour previous review,
104it is apparent that CO oxida-
tion over perovskites proceeds according to a supra-facial process, in which the electronic band structurenear the Fermi level is believed to play a keyrole.
104,159Thus, for the LaBO 3(B is transition atom
from V to Ni) perovskite series, LaCoO 3proved to be
the one most active159-163and LaCrO 3among the
least active for CO oxidation.164,165
On the basis of kinetic and spectroscopic data,
Tascon et al.166proposed a simple reaction mecha-
nism for CO oxidation on LaCoO 3:
where eq 6 should be the rate-determining step.
Oxygen is adsorbed as molecular O 2-species on Co2+
ions, which subsequently dissociates yielding atomic
oxygen (O-) adsorbed on the same site. On the other
hand, CO adsorbs on surface oxide ions, leading to alabile species that interacts with adsorbed atomicoxygen, producing a carbonate structure that thendecomposes to afford adsorbed CO
2and oxygen.
LaCuO 3-ä(ä)0.05 -0.45) perovskites offer a useful
model catalyst system in which the concentration ofoxygen vacancies can be gradually changed by con-trolled annealing under high oxygen pressures attemperatures from 1073 to 1273 K.
167These defect
structures were carefully characterized using theO2(g)fO2-

Rietveld method and photoelectron spectroscopy and
were then tested in the catalytic oxidation of COunder flow conditions. Stationary-state activity dataof the LaCuO
3-äsystems, expressed as moles of CO
converted per square meter and per minute, as afunction of temperature, are shown in Figure 6.Although all the samples display measurable activityat 423 K, differences among them become apparentat higher temperatures. The orthorhombic sampleLaCuO
2.55shows the strongest activity; its monoclinic
counterpart LaCuO 2.65is less active, and the tetrago-
nal samples LaCuO 2.73and LaCuO 2.95exhibit still
lower activity. Catalytic activity in CO oxidation islargely controlled by the number of oxygen vacanciespresent in the crystal structure. The almost stoichio-metric tetragonal LaCuO
2.95perovskite, with 90%
Cu3+, exhibits a moderate activity well below that of
the most nonstoichiometric compound (LaCuO 2.55)
with only 10% Cu3+irrespective of the temperature
range considered. As has been observed in the seriesof superconducting materials of the YBa
2Cu3O7-ä
family, the oxygen vacancies seem to be responsible
for this reaction.51The thermal decomposition under
reducing conditions of the orthorhombic LaCuO 2.55
phases at temperatures significantly lower than theremaining LaCuO
3-äphases167suggests that the
activity is also related to the ease of oxygen removal,either from the adsorbed state or from the lattice, asobserved in LaCoO
3-äseries.168
A strong enhancement in the catalytic activity for
CO oxidation has recently been reported on holedoped Ln
1-xSrxNiO 3(Ln)Pr, Sm, Eu) perovskites.169
Figure 7 shows the influence of reaction temperature
on the intrinsic activity for CO oxidation. To normal-ize differences in the specific areas of the Sr
xLn1-xNiO 3
samples, activity was expressed here as intrinsic
activity, which represents the number of moles of COconverted per square meter of catalyst and unit time.As expected for the three series of perovskites,intrinsic activities increased with the reaction tem-perature. In addition, the Sr-substituted sampleswere more active than the respective undoped Ln-NiO
3counterparts. However, the effect of Sr-substi-
tution was much more marked in Pr 0.95Sr0.05NiO 3,i n
which activity was nearly 3-fold activity of theunsubstituted PrNiO
3sample. Sr-substitution had a
less marked effect in Sm 0.90Sr0.10NiO 3and even less
effect in the Eu 0.99Sr0.01NiO 3sample. Since the hole-
doped samples underwent the first reduction processat lower temperatures than the respective undoped
compounds, activity is related to the ease of oxygenremoval. The reduction temperature decreases whenthe Ni valence is enhanced using a suitable Lnpartner in the crystal lattice. The larger the Ln
3+
cation, the higher is its basic character, and the more
enhanced is the actual valence for Ni. For Pr 0.95Sr0.05-
NiO 3sample, the formal valence of Ni is +3.05, which
results in a shorter Ni -O bond, and therefore re-
duced at lower temperatures.169Thus, the lattice
oxygens are more labile and can participate moreeasily in the external redox process, as depicted byeqs 4 -7.
2. Oxidation of Hydrocarbons
The reports by Libby170and Pedersen and Libby171
in the early 70s opened the possibility of using
perovskite oxides for the oxidation of hydrocarbons.Following this, the large body of work ensued solidarguments to explain the catalytic performance ofthese materials in terms of the relative ease withwhich oxygen species can be released from thesurface. The oxidation of paraffins,
172-190olefins,49,52
aromatics,185-187and oxygenate compounds53,185,188 -193
are the most representative examples.
The combustion of methane over perovskite oxides
has been extensively investigated, particularly in
Figure 6. Temperature dependence of the intrinsic activ-
ity in the catalytic CO oxidation on LaCuO 3-äcatalysts:

and (e) La 2CuO 4.

recent years (see below). The performance of these
compounds for the combustion of other long chainhydrocarbons has also been examined. Thus, Naka-mura et al.
51and Nitadori and Misono54studied
propane combustion on Sr- or Ce-substituted LaMO 3
(M)Fe, Co) perovskites. The activity of La 1-xSrxMnO 3
varied in a parallel way to the reducibility of the
catalyst surface, the amount of reversibly adsorbedoxygen, and the rate of isotopic equilibration ofoxygen. Since all these properties are related to thesurface oxygen, it can be inferred that the catalyticactivity is controlled by the nonstoichiometric char-acter of the surface. In another contribution, Kre-menic et al.
49studied the combustion of propylene
and isobutene at 573 K on LaBO 3(B)Cr, Mn, Fe,
Co, Ni) oxides and found the rates of isobutenecombustion to be higher than those of propylene. Inboth cases, a twin peak pattern with maxima for Mnand Co was observed (Figure 8), matched with thatobtained upon oxygen adsorption on the perovskites.Finally, the close parallelism between O
2adsorption
and catalytic activity in the combustion of propyleneand i-butene suggests that these reactions occurthrough a suprafacial mechanism, in which adsorbedoxygen is the dominant species participating in thereaction.
a. Methane Combustion. Perovskite-type oxides
show particular promise for the combustion of meth-ane (or natural gas) owing to their good stability, atleast below 1300 K, and high catalytic activity. Araiet al.
172studied the catalytic combustion of methane
over LaBO 3(B)transition element) and Sr-substi-
tuted La 1-xSrxBO 3(0<x<0.4) perovskites. Particu-
larly, the Sr-substituted manganites, cobaltites, andferrites exhibited very high oxidation activities com-
parable with the activity of a Pt/Al 2O3combustion
catalyst.172High catalytic activities for methane
combustion over perovskite oxides were also reportedby McCarty and Wise.
141An interesting characteristic
of these perovskites is the possibility of varying thedimensions of the unit cell by substitution of the Aion, and thereby the covalency of the B -O bond in
the ABO
3structure. Moreover, partial substitution
at the A-site can strongly affect catalytic activity dueto stabilization of unusual oxidation states of the Bcomponent and to the simultaneous formation ofstructural defects. Structural defects are responsiblenot only for part of the catalytic activity, but also foroxygen mobility within the crystal lattice, due to thenonstoichiometry created by substituting the A-site.An overview of these aspects as well as the implica-tions in methane combustion have been compiled inour previous reviews.
4,104
In a recent contribution, Ferri and Forni55demon-
strated that the type of substitution at the A-site infamilies of La
1-xA′xBO 3(B)Co, Fe, Ni) oxides has a
strong influence on methane combustion. Substitu-tion at the A-site with a bivalent cation (A ′)Sr, Eu)
or a tetravalent cation (A ′)Ce) led to a decrease or
an increase, respectively, of methane combustionactivity. The Eu- or Sr-substitution for La leads tohigher oxidation states for Co, so that the higher theamount of Sr, the higher is the concentration of Co
4+.
However, since Co4+is unstable, then oxygen release
can take place ending in the formation of oxygenvacancies. By contrast, insertion of Ce
4+leads to a
partial reduction of the Co3+to Co2+, thus affording
a large amount of active sites for oxygen adsorptionfrom gas-phase. Consistent with these observations,O
2TPD patterns revealed a high-temperature peak,
attributed to structural lattice oxygen, and a low-temperature peak corresponding to oxygen originatedby the reduction process involving the B-site cationand the formation of anion vacancies. At low tem-peratures, methane combustion on these catalysts isa suprafacial reaction
194involving oxygen coming
from the gas phase or sitting in the oxygen vacanciesof the catalyst.
160In fact, at low temeperature meth-
ane combustion rate is of zero order with respect tothe oxygen partial pressure due to a rapid incorpora-tion of gaseous oxygen into the lattice:
where k
1is the specific rate constant and PCH4is the
methane partial pressure. However, at high-temper-ature methane reacts with the oxygen supplied bythe catalyst and coming from the bulk (intrafacialmechanism).
194On the basis of these considerations,
the overall rate of CH 4combustion throughout the
whole temperature range can be described by thesum of two parallel reactions.
where P
O2and KO2are the partial pressure and
adsorption constant for oxygen. At high tempera-

tures, the reaction rate can be expressed simply as
r)KaPCH4(KO2PO2)1/2, if the oxygen coverage is small
(1.(KO2PO2)1/2. Equation 9 will thus be:
The contribution of each oxygen species to the
overall rate can be estimated separately by plottingthe experimental rate rvsP
O1/2.57The intercepts of
the straight lines ( PO2)0) represent the contribution
of lattice oxygen, which is expected to increase withincreasing reaction temperature. These consider-ations are consistent with the simultaneous partici-pation of suprafacial and intrafacial processes duringhydrocarbon oxidations taking place at low and hightemperatures, respectively, on perovskite oxides.

Monolith perovskites prepared from ultradispersed
powders of mixed oxides of rare earths (La-Ce or Dy-Y) and transition metals (Ni, Fe, Mn) have recentlybeen used in methane combustion.
91These preshaped
structures were seen to be active and selective in thetarget reaction over a wide range of temperatures.The scale of the specific activity and apparent activa-tion energy for monoliths paralleled that found forpowder samples. The catalyst decreased the ignitiontemperature, up to 200 K for the temperature re-quired to achieve a 10% methane conversion, andenhanced the selectivity to CO
2with respect the
uncatalyzed process.
b. Oxidative Coupling of Methane. Elshof et al.195
studied the oxidative coupling of methane on a La 0.6-
Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3membrane using O 2partial pressures
between 0.01 and 1 bar. Methane was converted toC
2H6and C 2H4with selectivities of up to 70% but at
conversion levels of only about 1 -3%. An important
requirement for the reaction is that the O 2flux
should be limited by exchange kinetics, becauseotherwise reduction of the membrane would occur,with the subsequent decrease in C
2selectivity. The
same reaction was studied in a membrane reactorwith BaCe
0.8Gd0.2O3-ä,196which is a mixed oxide ion -
electron hole conductor. By passing CH 4over one side
of the membrane and O 2over the other side, reason-
able conversions of methane were obtained, withmuch greater selectivity than when both CH
4and O 2
were fed to the same side of the membrane. Thismeans that the O species released from the mem-brane at the CH
4side is more active for C 2formation
than gaseous O 2. By considering both the surface
reactions on the membrane -gas interface and the
diffusion of the different charged species in the solid,equations for the transport of oxygen through thinmixed conducting membranes were derived.
197The
calculations show that the use of highly permeableceramic membranes with a catalytically active sur-face for the coupling reaction affords one the pos-sibility of achieving much higher C
2yields than with
a packed-bed reactor. The high C 2yield can only be
attained when the oxygen flux, the CH 4flow rate,
and the intrinsic reaction rate match each other.
Other perovskite membranes display proton con-
ductivity when exposed to a H-containing atmosphereat high temperatures. Iwahara et al.
198,199discussed
the application to steam electrolysis to produce H 2gas on proton conductive MCeO 3(M )Sr, Ba)
perovskites. In particular, the Nd-doped BaCeO 3
material shows significantly higher proton conduc-tion in wet air than SrCeO
3. This oxide was used as
a solid electrolyte in a steam electrolyzer producingH
2and in a H 2/air fuel cell. In the latter case, the
resistance of the solid electrolyte was the main factorlimiting cell performance. Hamakawa et al.
200re-
ported data on CH 4coupling using SrCe 0.95Yb0.05O3-ä
(SCYO) as a solid electrolyte in an electrochemical
cell. Because there is no gaseous O 2, which is
responsible for the combustion reaction, this maylead to a much better C
2-selectivity than can be
obtained with the conventional catalytic process.Chiang et al.
201also investigated the dehydrogenative
dimerization of methane using SCYO proton-con-ducting membranes and proposed that the rate-determining step is the formation of a CH
3âradical
by proton abstraction. Comparison of the activitydata using different reactors for this reaction indi-cates that the SCYO membrane reactor affords asubstantially larger yield than the correspondingconventional catalytic reactor.
202The experimental
results clearly show that the equilibrium conversionof the dehydrogenation reaction can be dramaticallychanged by using a proton-conducting membrane inan electrochemical reactor cell.
c. Partial Oxidation of Methane. Several perovskite
oxides have been studied as catalysts for the partialoxidation of methane to syngas (CH
4+1/2O2f
CO+2H 2).105,203 -205Slagtern and Olsbye203reported
the in situ formation and high activity of metalspecies for synthesis gas production on LaBO
3(B)
Rh, Ni, Co) perovskites, where the perovskite struc-ture decomposed during the reaction. The best sys-tem, LaRhO
3, displayed high activity at 1073 K for
long times on stream (120 h), and exhibited gooddispersion of Rh particles on the La
2O3phase, while
both LaNiO 3and LaCoO 3were deactivated, probably
due to coke formation during the reaction. In theseries of Ca
0.8Sr0.2Ti1-yNiyO3, Hayakawa et al.205
reported that the catalyst with a composition of y>
0.1 shows high activity for CH 4combustion at tem-
peratures around 873 K but suddenly changes tosynthesis gas formation at 1073 K. An increase in y
results in high activity for CH
4combustion, and the
highest selectivity to synthesis gas at 1073 K isobtained with catalyst y)0.2. Under the conditions
of synthesis gas formation, the overall reaction ap-pears to occur through two consecutive processes: thefirst part of the catalyst bed catalyzes CH
4combus-
tion under the O 2-rich atmosphere, and the second
part of the bed catalyzes CH 4reforming with the H 2O
and CO 2produced in the first part, under the O 2-
deficient atmosphere. Either Ni species in the per-ovskite structure or the NiO phase originally sepa-rated from the perovskite structure during catalystpreparation is easily reduced to Ni
0under the O 2-
deficient environment at high temperature, and theNi metal thus formed in the second zone shows highactivity for synthesis gas formation.
Lago et al.

synthesis gas. Among these compounds, the Gd -
Co-O system showed exceptional performance for
synthesis gas formation (Figures 9A -C). At 1009 K,
a steady-state CH 4conversion of 73%, with selectivi-
ties of 79 and 81% for CO and H 2, respectively, was
observed for the catalyst Gd -Co-O. The less active
Nd-Co-O and Sm -Co-O catalysts afford a similar
steady-state CH 4conversion within the temperature
range studied. The catalyst La -Co-O is active for
CH 4combustion, and only traces of H 2and CO were
observed under the reaction conditions used. It wasobserved that at constant temperature the steady-state yields of H
2and CO inversely followed the order
of the ionic radii of the rare earth, considering theoxidation state +3, coordination number 8, and the
sexquioxides of structural type A for La
2O3,P r 2O3,
and Nd 2O3and type B for Sm 2O3and Gd 2O3.105Thus,
gadolinium, which has the shortest ionic radius,exhibits the highest CO and H
2yields and contrasts
with the La-containing catalyst (the largest ion), inwhich no syngas was observed.
The nature of the Ln affects the reducibility of Co
in the LnCoO
3perovskites.105The Goldschmidt toler-
ance factor tobtained for these systems indicates
that, considering only geometric factors, lanthanum,which is the largest ion in the series, forms the moststable perovskite structure. This trend is reflectedin the reduction profiles, where the LaCoO
3perov-
skite, the most stable structure, is reduced at thehigher temperature (Figure 10). Likewise, the oxida-tion profiles obtained on the H
2-reduced perovskites
showed that reoxidation of cobalt to form the per-
ovskite structure is more favorable for larger lan-thanides. This finding agrees with the thermody-
namic calculations made by Katsura et al.98for the
oxidation of iron to the rare earth perovskite between1473 and 1673 K, who showed that reoxidation toform the perovskite is favored in the order La >
Nd>Sm >Gd, with standard Gibbs energies of
-288.0, -274.6, -267.9, and -263.7 kJ mol
-1, re-
spectively. Accordingly, deactivation of these cata-lysts derived from perovskite structures appears tobe related to the reoxidation of the active metal phaseduring the syngas reaction and the subsequent solid-state reaction with the lanthanide oxide (M
2O3+
Ln2O3fLnMO 3) to regenerate the original perovs-
kite phase.
Internal reforming reaction of methane and oxygen
(or air) in a solid oxide electrolyte fuel cell wasinvestigated by Yamada et al.
206These authors
reported that large electric power as well as syngas(CO +H
2) mixtures can be obtained by using LaGaO 3
perovskite as solid electrolyte. It was found that
doping of a small amount of cobalt for electrolyte iseffective in increasing the power density and the yieldof CO and H
2. In particular, the optimized composi-
tion La 0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg 0.115Co0.085O3for the electrolyte
afforded power density and yield of CO and H 2of 242
mW cm-2and 16%, respectively, at 1073 K. Consid-
ering that the thickness of electrolyte was 0.5 mmand small Gibbs free energy change for the partialoxidation of methane into CO and H
2, power genera-
tion characteristics of the cell was even superior.Since the decrease in power density was not signifi-cant when air is used as oxidant instead of oxygen,the internal reforming fuel cell is attractive not onlyfrom the standpoint of upgrading natural gas but alsofrom separation of air.
The reforming of methane using carbon dioxide as
an oxidant agent (dry reforming) (CH
4+CO 2f
2CO +2H 2) has also been investigated on Ni-based
perovskites.207-209La1-xSrxNiO 3(x)0-0.1) and
La2-xSrxNiO 4(x)0-1.0) perovskite series displayed

different performances in the dry reforming of CH 4.98
LaNiO 3shows high activity without coke formation
while La 2NiO 4is inactive. Among the Sr-substituted
perovskites, La 0.9Sr0.1NiO 3and La 1.8Sr0.2NiO 4display
the highest activity, with coke formation on thesurface. Initially, the catalytic activity increases withtime and then reaches steady state. Such an increasein catalyst performance is associated with the trans-formation of the original perovskite into La
2O2CO 3
and SrCO 3with highly dispersed Ni metal particles
due to the H 2generated in the reaction. The en-
hanced catalytic activity of Sr-substituted perovskitecould come from dual sites: La
2O3for CO 2adsorption
and Ni0for CH 4activation.
Perovskite membranes have also been studied for
the partial oxidation of methane to syngas.210-215
Tubular La 0.2Sr0.8Fe0.6Co0.4O3-ämembranes coated on
the inside of the tube with an Rh reforming catalystwere used in syngas production.
210At 1023 K, CH 4
conversion reaches levels above 98%, with a COselectivity of about 90% and an H
2yield almost twice
the CO yield. Since this perovskite is highly activein CH
4combustion, the overall reaction might pro-
ceed in such a way that the total combustion of CH 4
occurs (CH 4+2O2fCO 2+2H 2O), followed by a
reforming reaction (2CH 4+CO 2+H2Of3CO +
5H 2) on the Rh-coated reforming catalyst. Another
group of materials investigated is based on a com-position in the Sr
4(Fe 6-xCox)O13+äregion. These com-
pounds are not simple perovskites because the B/A
ratio is larger than 1 (in the perovskite ABO 3it is
1). These are layered compounds, which combine highelectronic/ionic conductivity with an appreciable oxy-gen permeability. Dense membranes of these materi-als can be used to separate high purity oxygen fromair and also to partially oxidize CH
4to synthesis gas,
without the need of an external electrical circuit.
Mixed oxygen anion- and electron-conducting mem-
branes derived from the browmillerite structureshave also been used for the same purpose.
216This
structure has the general composition A 2B2O5and is
attractive as an oxygen anion conductor since it cansupport a large population of O
2-vacancies, as well
as a variety of substituents in the A- and B-sites. Topromote the partial oxidation reaction utilizing thesemixed conducting membranes, they were successfullyassembled in tubes.
217One side of the reactor is
exposed to air, and hence the membrane serves toseparate oxygen from the atmosphere. This oxygenis then transported as oxide ions through the mem-brane where it goes on to react with the CH
4present
on the second side of the membrane, to yield syngas(Figure 11). Using these browmillerite membranesat 1173 K, H
2/CO ratios between 1.9 and 2.0, a CO
selectivity above 96% and a CH 4conversion of about
90% can be obtained. It should also be emphasizedthat this performance was maintained by the mem-brane for continuous operation for over one year on-stream.
d. Oxydehydrogenation of Ethane. Production of
ethylene monomer via oxidative dehydrogenation ofethane (ODE: C
2H6+1/2O2fC2H4+H2O) is a
reaction of great chemical and technological rel-evance. Besides the alkaline earth, rare earth, andtransition metal oxides, with or without the use of
alkali or halides as dopants, perovskite oxides areeffective systems for the ODE reaction. Hayakawaet al.
218studied the catalytic activity of CaTi 1-xFexO3-ä
(0<x<0.4) and SrTi 1-xFexO3-ä(0<x<1.0) for the
ODE reaction and found that the latter showedhigher C
2H4selectivity than the former. Later, Yi et
al.219reported a yield of 37% to C 2H4when working
at 923 K and C 2H6:O2)1:1 (molar ratios) in the feed.
A significant advance was achieved very recently byDai et al.,
220who embedded halide ions in the lattice
of the perovskite oxide. Following this approach, thedeep oxidation of C
2H6and C 2H4and the leaching of
the halide from the lattice were minimized. Theoxygen-deficient structures SrFeO
2.81and SrFeO 2.618-
Cl0.443 were highly active for the ODE reaction,
although the latter performed much better than theformer, with a C
2H4yield of ca. 63% when working
at 953 K, a reactant molar ratio of C 2H6:O2:N2)
2:1:3.7 and at atmospheric pressure. The tempera-ture-programmed desorption of oxygen and temper-ature-programmed reduction experiments show thatthe introduction of chlorine into the SrFeO
3-älattice
would lead to the regulation of oxygen vacancies andthe Fe
4+/Fe3+ratio and hence suppression of C 2H6
and C 2H4deep oxidation.
e. Other Oxidation Reactions. Perovskites have also
been studied as model compounds in the oxidationof oxygenated compounds.
190-193Trikalitis and Pomo-
nis190reported the activity profiles for the decomposi-
tion of isopropyl alcohol on La 1-xSrxVO 3-äperovskites
at temperatures between 473 and 573 K. Among thetwo reaction products, acetone and propylene, theselectivity of the reaction for x)0 was ca. 15% for
acetone and increased linearly with the substitutionof La by Sr, reaching a value of 40% at x)1.0. The
apparent activation energy calculated for the totalconversion of i-propyl alcohol according to first-orderkinetics was close to 120 kJ mol
-1, which is similar
to that found for acetone formation while thatestimated for the propylene formation was lower by10-15 kJ mol
-1on average. The influence of elec-
tronic effects on the reaction appeared negligible,whereas the acid/base function of the catalyst playeda key role. More recently, Sumathi et al.
193have
studied the selective oxidation and dehydrogenation

Bi, Cu, Sb) perovskites in the absence and in thepresence of oxygen. Partial reduction of the catalystwas observed on-stream when the reaction wascarried in the absence of O
2or at low O 2partial
pressures. Catalytic activity was found to depend onthe reducibility of the catalyst surface, and this washigher for Cu-containing perovskites and lower forBaMO
3(B)Ti, Ce) oxides. Catalytic activity and
reducibility were correlated with metal -oxygen bond-
ing as well as with the free energy of reduction ofB-site cations
The chemical and thermal stabilities of perovskite-
type oxides have also been exploited for the oxidationof halocompounds.
221,222Kiessling et al.221reported
the complete decomposition of CH 3Cl, CH 2Cl2and
1,2-C 2H4Cl2in air over LaMO 3(M)Mn, Co) and
La0.84Sr0.16Mn 0.67Co0.33O3perovskite oxides at tem-
peratures above 800 K. Besides the main reactionproducts (carbon dioxide, water, and hydrochloricacid) chlorine-containing byproducts (C -C coupling
and cracking) were also formed in the low tempera-ture range. Depending on the reaction temperature,the residence time and the type of reactant halocom-pound, a reversible catalyst deactivation takes place.Considering the formation of chloride species on thesurface and in the bulk during reaction, it wassuggested that the formation of more highly chlori-nated byproducts takes place by insertion of chloridespecies on the catalyst surface in reactants or inter-mediates. The preferential formation of these byprod-ucts with increasing time on-stream and with resi-dence time, as well as the reaction temperature atlower conversion degrees, is consistent with a con-secutive insertion of chloride on the surface inintermediates or adsorbed halocompounds.
B. Pollution Abatement
1. NO xDecomposition
The decomposition of N 2O into its elements is one
of the best model reactions to evaluate the catalyticactivity of many materials in heterogeneous cataly-sis.
223The elementary steps involved in the N 2O
decomposition reaction can be summarized as follows:
The decomposition rate is inhibited by oxygen, and
its desorption has been found to be the rate-limitingstep of the overall reaction
224-226(eq 15). Thus, the
reaction rate would be expected to depend on thelattice parameter of the perovskite, because the M -O
bond length and bond energy should alter the M -O
ad.
This aspect and a brief account of the works con-ducted on N 2O decomposition on perovskites up to
the end of 80s were sunmmarized in our previousreview.
104
The catalytic decomposition of N 2O to nitrogen and
oxygen was investigated by Gunasekaran et al.227
over various substituted La 0.8Sr0.2MO 3-ä(M)Cr, Fe,
Mn, Co, Y) perovskite series. Among the various solidsolutions, La
0.8Sr0.2CoO 3-äshowed a maximum N 2O
conversion of 90% at 873 K. The activity of La 0.8-
Sr0.2CoO 3-äwas found to be comparable to a reference
Pd/Al 2O3catalyst at temperatures above 773 K when
feeding N 2O (in helium). However, incorporation of
O2to the feed stream (about 4% O 2) led to a decrease
in the conversion of N 2O by ca. 13% in the case of
La0.8Sr0.2CoO 3-ä, whereas it remained constant in the
Pt/Al 2O3catalyst. Complementary studies on the
reduction -oxidation properties as well as nonsto-
ichiometry and oxygen desorption capacity oversubstituted La
1-xSrxMO 3-ä(M)Mn, Fe, Co) con-
firmed the operation of a redox mechanism for N 2O
decomposition reaction.228,229In addition, the effect
of added oxygen in the reaction feed was to inhibitboth N
2O conversion and the overall reaction rate,
consistent with the established reaction mechanismin eqs 13 -17 above.
The decomposition of NO into N
2and O 2(2NO f
N2+O2) is thermodynamically favorable at temper-
atures below 1300 K. It is generally accepted thatthe decomposition of NO involves the dissociation ofNO to nitrogen and oxygen on a catalytic surface andthat nitrogen readily desorbs as N
2while oxygen is
strongly retained on the surface. Catalysts active forNO decomposition should accordingly display notonly the ability to adsorb and dissociate NO but alsothe ability to facilitate the desorption of oxygen. Abroad variety of catalytic systems such as metals,simple and mixed metal oxides, and ion-exchangedzeolites have been studied for this purpose.
230-232
Several perovskite-type oxides exhibit good perfor-
mance for the decomposition of NO at temperaturesabove 750 K
104,233 -235and are quite stable for long-
term operation at these high temperatures.236
Most of the results reported on the decomposition
of NO on perovskite oxides can be described bya reaction scheme that includes the participationof molecular and dissociative chemisorption ofNO:

(W/F) on the NO decomposition activity of La 0.8Sr0.2-
CoO 3and La 0.4Sr0.6Mn 0.8Ni0.2O3perovskites. The re-
action was practically first-order with respect to NOand was inhibited by O
2. To explain the kinetic
results in a consistent fashion, a reaction mechanismwas proposed in which the active site would be a pairof adjacent oxide ion vacancy sites near the surface.The reaction of NO molecules on the active site isassumed to occur stepwise (first-order kinetics). NOis adsorbed along with the oxygen atom that fits intothe vacancy, and an electron flows to the NO mol-ecule from a B-site cation neighboring the vacancy,giving rise to the formation of the NO
-species and
the concomitant oxidation of the B-site cation(Co
3+fCo4+;M n3+fMn4+;N i2+fNi3+). As is well-
known,241electron transfer to the antibonding orbital
of NO reduces the bond order from 2.5 to 2 andfacilitates the cleavage of the N -O bond. Once the
second NO molecule has been adsorbed, a free N
2
molecule is released into the gas phase by theinteraction of two neighboring NO
-species. The
release of oxygen is regulated by the adsorption -
desorption equilibrium, and the formation of twooxide vacancies ( 0) involves a 4-electron process:
Because of the easy redox change of B
(n+1)+/Bn+
(BdMn, Co, Ni) and the good electrical conductivity
of the solids, electron transfer is expected to occursmoothly. Support for the redox mechanism operatingin NO decomposition was provided by Bontchev etal.,
239who observed that the reaction is enhanced on
BaRu xBi1-xO3by the particular crystal structure of
these oxides, with a high percentage of hexagonallystacked units of two and/or three RuO
6octahedra.
The concentration of these units increases with theRu content, and they can be regarded as active sitesfor the NO decomposition reaction.
DV-X Rcluster molecular orbital method
242was
applied to investigate the electronic effects of theLaBO
3(B from Ti to Ni) series on the reactivity of
the adsorbed NO molecule and the oxygen producedby direct NO decomposition at the oxygen vacancy.Yokoi and Uchida
242calculated the bond orders of
N-B and O -B pairs and found that they correlate
with the maximum temperature of the O 2DTP peaks.
In addition, the ease O 2desorption was ascribed to
the higher binding energy component of the O1s core-level spectra located at 530.5 -531.5 eV. Thus it can
be assumed intuitively that the desorption site ofsuch an O1s species is the active site for the directdecomposition reaction of NO on this perovskite oxidefamily.
2. Exhaust Treatment
Perovskite oxides are excellent candidates as cata-
lysts particularly suited for exhaust gas depollutionprocesses. They can be regarded as valuable alterna-tive catalysts to supported noble metals, which areeasy to synthesize at lower cost and with greatthermal stability up to high temperatures. Thissection compiles the reduction processes of NO in thepresence of different reducing agents.Most work on the reduction of NO on perovskites
has focused on the use of CO as a reducing gasbecause of the need to control NO and CO emissionsespecially from motor vehicles. Mechanistically, theCO+NO reaction on perovskites seems to proceed
through the formation of N
2O and surface isocyanate
species.46If this possibility exists, then the perov-
skites must be tailored in such a way that the directoxidation of CO becomes an easy process as comparedwith the isocyanate route. This may be possible witha proper choice of the cations in the perovskite oxides,with orbitals of suitable energy and symmetry ableto activate the CO molecule directly so as to promotethe oxidation reaction over the formation of isocyan-ate species.
Different perovskite systems were investigated as
catalysts for the NO +CO reaction in the 90s. Among
these are La
1-xFeO 3,243LaCoO 3,244,245LaMnO 3and
LaMn 0.99Pt0.01O3246, LaMO 3and La 1-xSrxMO 3(M)
Fe, Co, Mn, Cr, Ni),247-249La1-xSrxAl1-2yCuyRuyO3,250
La0.8Sr0.2Co1-2yCuyRuyO3,251and La 2-xSrxNiO 4.252,253
On La 2-xSrxNiO 4, the transformation of NO is mono-
molecular as compared to CO oxidation, which is abimolecular reaction. The apparent activation ener-gies run parallel for both reactions, CO oxidationshowing higher values, especially in the high tem-perature region. Kinetic analysis reveals that NO ismore strongly adsorbed in samples poor in oxygen(large x) and more loosely on samples rich in that
element (small x) in the low-temperature region,
while at higher temperatures and at large x, the
excess oxygen produced acts as a poison to thereaction.
253Details on the mechanism of the CO +
NO reaction on La 1-xCexCoO 3were provided by Forni
et al.254In this system, the first step involves the
oxidation of CO by the catalyst surface, followed bythe dissociative adsorption of NO onto the catalystsurface. Finally, the adsorbed nitrogen yields N
2O,
N2, and NCO adalong three parallel paths. Thus,
oxygen exchange between NO and CO seems to occurindirectly and involves an oxygen vacancy. Addition-ally, the catalytic activity is decreased by the replace-
ment of Ce
4+by La3+in the perovskite structure,
which reduces the mobility of bulk oxygen. A differentmechanism is operative in the reducible La
2CuO 4
system:255activity increases during the reaction up
to a stabilized level while the solid is reduced withthe formation of Cu
0and La 2O3, suggesting that the
reduced copper sites are active in the CO +NO
reaction. This reduction and the resulting activationare not determined by the stoichiometry of thereaction mixture conditions because they can alsooccur under oxidative reaction conditions when NOis present in large excess with respect to CO.
Effective reduction of NO was also accomplished
by ethylene-
256and hydrogen-257reducing agents.
Harada et al.256reported the performance for the
selective reduction of NO with C 2H4over perovskites
containing Co, Mn, Fe, Cr, Al, Sn, and Ti as host Bcations in the ABO
3structure. Only the systems with
a nonredox function (Al, Sn, and Ti) displayed selec-tive catalytic reduction of NO. Over perovskitescontaining redox cations, the undesirable consump-tion of C
2H4by O 2proceeded preferentially. Ferri et2O2-+4B(n+1)+f2(0)+4Bn++O2(g) (20)2002 Chemical Reviews, 2001, Vol. 101, No. 7 Pen ˜a and Fierro
al.257used La 0.9Ce0.1MO 3(M )Mn, Fe, Co, Ni)
perovskites for NO reduction by H 2and observed
M)Co as the most active. Activity was found to
depend on both anion vacancies and Co2+ions. The
NO reduction with H 2includes reduction of the
catalyst followed by NO adsorption, which is favoredby the lower oxidation state of the B-site cation. Thisinvolves the catalyst in a redox cycle exploiting itsdefect structure. The higher activity found for cobal-tates could thus be attributed to the presence ofO-vacancies suitable for NO adsorption. However, theoxidation state of the B-ion is also important. Indeed,the La
0.9Ce0.1CoO 3+äcatalyst performed better after
pretreatment in O 2at high temperature. Under these
conditions, oxygen is accommodated in the O-vacan-cies, which then desorb, favoring NO oxidation tosurface NO
2. In addition, the formation of Co2+ions
is needed in this catalyst to achieve a better adsorp-tion and thus a faster N -O dissociation.
In the mid 70s, placing a catalyst in the exhaust
of car engines opened a new area for the applicationof catalysts for controlling gaseous emissions fromboth mobile and stationary sources. This has receivedimpetus due to the development of three-way cata-lysts (TWC) for converting HC, NO
x, and CO simul-
taneously.258The systems used for this purpose are
small particles of Pt, Pd, and Rh deposited on a ceria-alumina-coated ceramic substrate and display anumber of desirable properties such as high activity,stability, and resistance to sulfur poisoning. However,
shortage of the worldwide resources of noble-metalsand high prices limit their use for such a purpose.In addition, the presence of water vapor and carbondioxide in the exhaust stream along with the high-temperature reached sometimes due to local over-heating make the perovskite oxides (ABO
3) excellent
candidates as TWC catalysts. These systems oftenexhibit activity comparable to that of noble metalcatalysts.
104,259
Incorporating noble metals (Pt, Pd, Rh) into the
perovskite structure results in the stabilization of themetal against sintering, volatilization, or solid-statereaction with the substrate. Some enhancement inactivity of the simple perovskite can also be achievedwhen small amounts of noble metals are incorpo-rated. Sorenson et al.
260adopted this approach to use
noble metal-loaded perovskites for the simultaneousreduction of NO and the oxidation of CO and un-burned hydrocarbons. These authors found the sub-stituted multicomponent cobaltite (La
0.6Sr0.4)(Co 0.94-
Pt0.03Ru0.03)O3highly active and selective for exhaust
treatment from single cylinder engine. Selectivereduction of NO
x(>90%) was attained in excess CO
while efficient oxidation of hydrocarbons and CO wasobserved at the oxidizing side of the stoichiometricO
2:fuel ratio. As can be seen in Figure 12, the above
perovskite provides an operating window in whichthe elimination of all three pollutants was about 80%or higher.
It has been shown recently that the incorporation
of a small amount of Rh into the LaMnO
3.15perov-
skite (LaMn 0.976Rh0.024O3.15) leads to high three-way
catalytic activity in a synthetic CO +NO +C3H6
mixture.261Rh is an essential component for thereduction of NO, while Mn3+ions allow the total
oxidation of CO and C 3H6. In this work, the stoichio-
metric factor ( s))(2O 2+NO)/(CO +9C3H6) was
varied from very reducing ( s)0.46) to very oxidizing
(s)2.18) conditions with large amplitude oscillations
of the feed stream. These oscillations have only aslight influence on the catalyst performance, and thelight-off temperatures for catalyst La(MnRh)O
3.15
were quite similar under stationary and cyclingconditions. The lack of effect of the oscillating condi-tions suggests that the over-stoichiometric oxygen iseasily removed and replenished from the oxide latticeand is used under oscillating conditions to compen-sate for the variations in the composition of thereactant mixture: at 673 K this oxygen is consumedunder a stream of CO to form CO
2, whereas the La-
(MnRh)O 3.15is transformed into La(MnRh)O 3. The
over-stoichiometric oxygen can be easily recoveredunder oxygen or NO under the conditions of three-way reactions. This corresponds to the oxygen storagecapacity of the catalyst, which allows stable highperformance in rich/lean oscillating compositions.Additional experiments in the presence of 10% steamin the feed stream revealed some catalyst deactiva-tion; in particular, NO reduction was strongly inhib-ited.
261This deactivation was explained in terms of
(i) strong adsorption of water on the La(MnRh)O 3
surface which poisons active sites and (ii) participa-tion of water gas-shift (WGS) and reforming reac-tions. The type ii possibility seems very likely becausethe H
2produced by the WGS reaction does not
dissociate on the mixed oxide and hence cannot favorNO reduction. This is not the case of noble metalTWCs, which are highly active for such reactions,while at the same time maintaining the ability todissociatively adsorb hydrogen and reduce NO.
Alkaline and alkaline earth perovskites are also
highly active for the combustion of soot particulatesin diesel engine exhaust.
262,263The ignition temper-
ature with perovskite oxides decreases by more than200 K as compared to carbon particulates alone. Inthe ABO
3perovskites, partial substitution of alkali
and alkaline-earth metals at the A-site enhances thecatalytic activity in the combustion of soot particu-lates. The removal of soot is also favored by the
Figure 12. Conversions of NO x, CO, and hydrocarbons on
a multicomponent cobaltite (La 0.6Sr0.4)(Co 0.94Pt0.03Ru0.03)-

of excess oxygen on the pollutants removal.Chemical Structures and Performance of Perovskite Oxides Chemical Reviews, 2001, Vol. 101, No. 7 2003
presence of NO xin the feed stream, and the reaction
presumably takes place at the interface point wheresoot-oxide and NO gas meet.
3. Stability
The stability of a few unsubstituted (LaMnO 3,
LaCoO 3) and Pb-substituted (La 1-xPbxMnO 3) perov-
skites was studied by Yao.264It was observed that
the introduction of steam caused a drop in catalystactivity, the resulting specific activity being compa-rable to that of the single oxide (Co
3O4)a tl o w
temperature. Conversely, adding a 0.1% SO 2into the
feed stream resulted in an enhancement in activityof the Pt-substituted perovskites (only containing 300ppm Pt). This effect is, however, opposite to thegeneral tendency to decrease activity instead ofincreasing activity in the presence of SO
2. Quantita-
tive studies of the chemisorption of SO 2on several
La-containing perovskites revealed that the amountof chemisorbed SO
2required to suppress the reaction
rate by a 90% is approximately that of one monolayer.SO
2chemisorption is believed to occur on cation sites
via the formation sulfite -sulfate structures. Looking
at the interaction modes of SO 2on perovskites
surfaces, Tejuca et al.104suggested that the poisoning
effect of SO 2on ABO 3perovskites is primarily as-
sociated with its adsorption on the catalytically activeB cations (ionic radius of B
3+is smaller than that of
A3+). The interaction of SO 2at the B-site cannot be
ruled out, although such a process does not lead tocatalyst deactivation.
Chemisorbed SO
2on the perovskite surface can be
readily reduced by the CO present in the feedstream.
265,266The reaction produces elemental sulfur
(eq 21), although further reaction between S andexcess CO is expected to occur (eq 22):
It was reported that COS formation can be strongly
inhibited using the perovskite LaTiO
3, even at high
SO 2conversions. This behavior appears to be related
to the high resistance of LaTiO 3to form sulfides, with
the elemental sulfur produced by reaction 21. Thisexplanation is based on the fact that the stability ofthe oxide versus sulfide, as measured by the differ-ence between the heats of formation of simple oxidesand sulfides for different transition metals, was foundto reach a maximum for Ti.
237A few examples
showing the performance and the stability of severalperovskites in the reduction of SO
2with CO were
summarized in our previous work.4
More recently, it was demonstrated that incorpora-
tion of Pt to a substituted (LaCe)(FeCo)O 3perovskite
leads to high activity and durability.267Surface
analysis of the original sample revealed that pal-ladium is present as a mixture of Pd
4+and Pd2+;
however, the catalyst subjected to accelerated agingtests showed a single component characterized by abinding energy of Pd3d core electrons of Pd
3+species.
This unusual, high valence state of Pd in the per-ovskite structure seems to be responsible for thediffusion of oxygen ions within the crystal. As aresult, adsorption -desorption of activated oxygen is
favored, thereby affording enhanced catalyst perfor-mance. The mechanism responsible for the improve-ment of catalytic activity of the Pd-loaded (LaCe)-(FeCo)O
3perovskite is primarily associated with the
specific incorporation of Pd as a solid-solution intothe structure that controls the growth of Pd particlesunder the redox atmosphere at high temperature.
C. Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis Reactions
1. Hydrogenation of Carbon Oxides
Transition metals and metal oxide-promoted met-
als have been used for the synthesis of hydrocar-bon
268-272and oxygenated compounds57,273 -278from
syngas (CO +H2) mixtures. Regarding these reac-
tions, ¢G° values at 298 K are in most cases negative
and a large variety of products (paraffins, olefins,alcohols, ethers, esters) can be achieved under ap-propriate reaction conditions. From the analysis ofthe existing vast body of work, it can be concludedthat there is a close relationship between the natureand chemical state of the elements responsible forthe activity and the type of surface C-containingintermediates and product distributions.
279-281Ac-
cordingly, ABO 3perovskite-type oxides with reducible
B3+ions under typical reaction conditions are excel-
lent model catalysts to gain useful insight into thesurface process taking place during CO (and CO
2)
activation and carbon chain growth.
a. CO Hydrogenation. Somorjai et al.282,283studied
the influence of reduction pretreatments on theactivity of LaRhO
3at different temperatures in
syngas conversion. The reaction products were CH 3-
OH and hydrocarbons (HC) and the relative propor-tion CH
3OH/HC was found to be highly temperature-
dependent. These results were rationalized by assum-ing that two different reaction mechanisms areinvolved: CH
3OH is formed through a nondissocia-
tive adsorption of CO, whereas hydrocarbon forma-tion follows a dissociative mechanism. The changeof the CH
3OH/HC ratio with temperature is due to
competing H- and CO-insertion reactions and vari-able proportions of molecularly and dissociativelyadsorbed CO and H
2on the surface. As the methanol
is the major reaction product at temperatures below500 K, hydrogenation of adsorbed CO species pre-dominates. However, at temperatures above 620 Kthe C -O bond splits and CH
3OH formation is strongly
inhibited, while methane and other C 2+hydrocar-
bons are the major reaction products. In the middletemperature range, C -O is broken, yielding CH
x
fragments that can then recombine to form either
CH 4or other HC through hydrogenation reactions or
undergo CO insertion to yield oxygenates. Surfaceanalysis of the activated catalysts allowed theseauthors to conclude that the active catalyst containsRh
+species and a small proportion of Rh0.
Gysling et al.284and Monnier and Apai285investi-
gated the hydrogenation of CO on H 2-reduced La-
RhO 3perovskite at reaction temperatures from 493
to 623 K. These authors observed that the formationrates of HC decreased monotonically with the numberof C atoms, suggesting the participation of a commonSO2+2CO fS+2CO2 (21)
S+COfCOS (22)2004 Chemical Reviews, 2001, Vol. 101, No. 7 Pen ˜a and Fierro
mechanism for carbon chain growth. However, at
temperatures above 548 K the formation rates ofC
2+OH were found to be greater than for CH 3OH,
indicating that the mechanism is different in bothcases. The C
2+OH oxygenates are probably formed
by CO insertion into adsorbed alkyl fragments, aspreviously reported by Ichikawa and Fukushima
286
and Watson and Somorjai.282The quite similar
product distributions observed during the hydroge-nation of CO on LaRhO
3and a conventional Rh/SiO 2
catalyst at the same reaction temperatures suggeststhat the same catalytic Rh species is present in bothcatalysts. Since the Rh present on Rh/SiO
2catalysts
is considered to be Rh0under such reaction condi-
tions,284,285it may be inferred that the active rhodium
present in LaRhO 3should also be Rh0.
Noble metal perovskites of the type BaBO 3(B)
Rh, Ru, Ir, Pt) have also been used in syngasconversion.
273BaRhO 3and BaPtO 3were found to
yield selectively oxygenates, almost exclusively metha-nol (maximum selectivities of 62 and 54%, respec-tively). By contrast, the BaRuO
3perovskite showed
the lowest oxygenate selectivity. All these perovskiteswere pure crystalline phases prior to catalyst testing.The bulk oxidation state of the noble metal was theexpected M
4+, although partially reduced species
instead of, or in addition to, the M4+state were
observed. Both crystalline and amorphous BaBO 3
perovskites are unstable against syngas and itsreaction products; the B
4+ion is reduced to M0, and
the barium is converted to BaCO 3.
Copper-substituted perovskites were also used in
syngas conversion by Broussard and Wade273and
Brown-Bourzutshky et al.275These authors observed
that substitution of Mn by Cu in LaMnO 3samples
shifted the product distribution from hydrocarbonsto methanol and small amounts of C
2+oxygenates.
Later on, van Grieken et al.278used LaTi 1-xCuxO3
perovskites to analyze the effect of the substitution
degree ( x) on the activity and product distributions
during CO hydrogenation. The conversion of COstrongly depends on the Cu substitution, the highestvalues being attained in the 0.5 exe1.0 composition
range and the lowest for x)0. LaTiO
3produced
methanol, CH 4, and CO 2, with selectivities about
30%, and a substantially lower proportion of di-methyl-ether. Upon incorporation of Cu, the selectiv-ity of the alcohols increased whereas that of metha-nation decreased. It was also emphasized that areference Cu/La
2O3catalyst gave lower methanol
selectivity and substantially higher selecitvities toCO
2,C H 4,C2H6, and dimethyl-ether. The methanol
synthesis rate was found to pass through a maximumat substitution x)0.6. This rate of 9.7 10
-2gh-1
m-2is similar to the one observed by Sheffer and
King274for a 1.2% K-promoted unsupported Cu
catalyst working under similar reaction conditions.All these findings clearly indicate the importance ofcopper for both activity and selectivity toward metha-nol.
Surface analysis of used catalysts revealed that
copper becomes reduced, and that for x)1.0, and to
a lesser extent for x)0.6, the reduced Cu-phase
coexists with a minor proportion of Cu
2+ions. Thisis consistent with the presence of both CuO and La 2-
CuO 4phases in the calcined sample; only CuO is
reduced in H 2at 573 K while La 2CuO 4remains
unreduced up to 673 K:
The Auger parameter of copper in a representative
LaMn 0.5Cu0.5O3catalyst prereduced and used in CO
hydrogenation at 573 K appeared 1849.2 eV,278which
agrees with that at 1848.8 eV observed by Shefferand King
274for a K-promoted copper catalyst exposed
to a CO:H 2mixture, and by Karwaci et al.287for Cu 2O
(Cu+). This result indicates that Cu+species are
present in the used catalyst and are presumablyinvolved in the CH
3OH synthesis reaction. As copper
is stabilized in the La 2CuO 4phase, Cu+ions can be
developed on its surface under on-stream operation.The fact that Cu
+ions remain dispersed and embed-
ded in the La 2CuO 4matrix also explains the high
resistance to sintering of the resulting reduced phase,thus explaining the great stability of these catalystsfor long periods. The differences in catalytic behaviorof LaTi
1-xCuxO3and the reference Cu/La 2O3sample
were explained in terms of the structural differences.Because large Cu
0crystallite particles have been
found in the Cu/La 2O3catalyst it seems that the
formation of hydrocarbons very probably occurs onmetallic Cu. Because CO does not dissociate onCu
0,288adsorbed CO can be hydrogenated to form H x-
CO intermediates, which then dissociates into CH x
fragments, the starting precursor of the hydrocar-bons. Finally, the presence of a small proportion ofCu
+on the surface of the Cu crystals, or in close
contact with them, cannot be excluded, since thisspecies appears to be involved in the synthesis ofmethanol.
b. CO
2Hydrogenation. Hydrogenation of CO 2on
metal catalysts produces mainly CH 4, with minor
amounts of higher hydrocarbons. Alhough this is astrong H
2-consuming reaction, a few works were
focused on the use of perovskite systems for thetarget reaction. Ulla al.
289studied the catalytic
behavior for CO 2hydrogenation of La 1-xMxCoO 3
(M)Sr, Th) perovskites prereduced at different
extents. For unsubstituted LaCoO 3, the initial reac-
tion rate of the reduced perovskite depended on theextent of reduction but did not reach a maximum.The production of C
2+products decreased at higher
degrees of reduction, whereas CH 4selectivity fol-
lowed the opposite trend. However, the La 0.8Th0.2-
CoO 3sample was much more active and selective to
CH 4than its unsubstituted LaCoO 3counterpart, and
the extent of reduction does not significantly affectedthe initial rate. The behavior of La
0.6Sr0.4CoO 3was
found to depend on the reaction temperature. Below570 K, the product distribution of the unreduced andthe H
2-treated catalysts was close to that of the Th-
substituted sample. However, at higher reductiondegrees CH
4selectivity decreased and the amount of
C2+products increased with the extent of reduction.
In particular, the fully reduced catalyst gave thehighest selectivity to C
2+products.CuO +La2CuO4+H2fCu0+La2CuO4+H2O
(23)Chemical Structures and Performance of Perovskite Oxides Chemical Reviews, 2001, Vol. 101, No. 7 2005
It has been observed that the surface Co/La ratio
in the reduced catalysts correlates with the rate ofmethanation and C
2+production. This shows that Co0
is the active species on which CO 2first chemisorbs
dissociatively and then the adsorbed CO fragmentundergoes further hydrogenation, in accordance withthe mechanisms describing hydrogenation of COadsorbed on Group VIII metal surfaces.
270The rate
of CH 4formation over the H 2-reduced La 1-xMxCoO 3
samples reported by Ulla et al.289was substantially
higher than that reported by Weatherbee and Bar-tholomew
290for a silica-supported Co catalyst under
similar reaction conditions, indicating that the spe-cific activity of the metallic sites is affected by thesurrounding matrix. This led to the conclusion thatthe Co
0crystallites developed on the surface on both
Th- and Sr-substituted perovskites have a higherspecific methanation activity than Co on silica. Thematrix effect may arise from the stabilization ofhighly dispersed cobalt particles on the perovskitesurface, which in turn would be affected by the basiccharacter of the perovskite components.
2. Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis Reactions
Since Pedersen and Libby171first reported that
ACoO 3(A)lanthanide elements) oxides are more
active than some transition metals for the hydro-genolysis of cis-2-butene, many other hydrogenation
reactions have been carried out on perovskite oxides.Among these, the use of cobaltites for hydrogenolysisof various alkanes
291-293and ethylene102,294,295remain
prominent.
The hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of C 2-C5
hydrocarbons proceed according to the following
reaction scheme (except for the butene isomers):291
Reactions 1, 2, and 3 represent the hydrogenation ofalkenes, the direct hydrogenolysis of alkenes, andhydrogenolysis of alkanes, respectively. The reactionof C
2H4with H 2on LaCoO 3below 420 K yields only
the hydrogenated product C 2H6, whereas above this
reaction temperature the hydrogenolysis of C 2H4
forms CH 4in addition to the hydrogenation. The
hydrogenolysis of C 3-C5alkanes such as propane,
butane, isobutane, pentane, isopentane, and neopen-tane on LaCoO
3produces only CH 4.291,292Neither the
corresponding alkenes nor the fragmented hydrocar-bons are formed in the gas phase. The reaction orderwith respect to the hydrocarbon pressure is unity forall reactions, while the hydrogen order increases withthe number of carbon atoms involved in the reactanthydrocarbons. Thus, reaction orders of 0.0, 1.0, and2.0 were found for C
3H8,C 4H10, and C 5H12, respec-
tively. By contrast, in the reaction of alkenes withH
2, methane, and the corresponding alkanes were
produced. For example, the reaction of propene withhydrogen produces a considerable amount of meth-ane, together with propane during the initial reactionstage. The reaction of butenes with hydrogen under-
goes rapid isomerization, followed by the formationof butane and then methane. For all reactions, theratios of the butene isomers produced remain almostunchanged until the disappearance of the reactantbutenes; the cis-2-butene/ trans -2-butene, cis-2-butene/
1-butene, and trans -2-butene/1-butene ratios are 1.0,
1.8, and 1.8, respectively. Since there is no markeddifference in the observed rates of butene hydrogena-tion, the average of these rates represents that ofbutene hydrogenation.
The hydrogenolysis of alkanes has mainly been
studied for transition metal catalysts.
295The kinetic
behavior is characterized by negative orders withrespect to H
2pressure and by a wide variety of
fragmented hydrocarbons, except for the selectiveformation of C
2H6in the case of nickel catalysts.296
The proposed mechanism involves the dissociativeadsorption of alkanes, releasing an H-atom on thesurface, followed by step-by-step cleavage of C -C
bonds. It is emphasized that the hydrogenolysisreactions of alkanes on LaCoO
3are characterized not
only by the high reaction order with respect to theH
2pressure but also by the selective formation of
CH 4; neither the other fragmented nor hydrogenated
hydrocarbons are detected in the gas phase. Tracerisotopic studies in the reaction of alkanes withdeuterium showed that large amounts of methane(CHD
3and CD 4) are involved, even from the initial
stage of hydrogenolysis, whereas the fractions of the
D2-exchanged alkanes are negligibly small. These
results indicate that the adsorption of alkanes isirreversible, although the surface species thus pro-duced undergo a rapid hydrogen exchange.
Ichimura et al.
293compared the behavior of La-
CoO 3, LaFeO 3, and LaAlO 3in the hydrogenolysis of
alkanes and observed that only LaCoO 3perovskite
is active in these reactions. The reaction exhibits amaximum rate at a given temperature, which de-pends on the nature of each catalyst: ca. 420 K forLaCoO
3and LaFeO 3, and 490 K for LaAlO 3. The
distributions of D-atoms in the reactants and prod-ucts, when D
2is used instead of H 2, indicate highly
D-exchanged ethanes at 333 and 573 K. However, thedeuterium distributions among gaseous hydrogenisotopes reaches equilibrium at high temperatures,although much smaller amounts of HD and H
2are
produced at lower temperatures. These isotope dis-tributions indicate that the hydrogenation proceedsvia an ethyl radical as intermediate and the rate-determining step varies from the adsorption of hy-drogen at 333 K to the hydrogenation of the ethylradical at 573 K.
In the TPD spectra of hydrocarbons from LaCoO
3
exposed to ethane at 300 K, single peaks of C 2H2and
C2H4appear at ca. 380 K and two peaks of C 2H6at
ca. 380 and 540 K, with methane only above 450 K.Almost the same TPD spectra are obtained from thesurface exposed to C
2H4, although the fraction of
methane formed is smaller. The TPD spectra ofhydrogen from LaCoO
3shows two peaks, referred to
as the R-peak, appearing below 340 K, and the
â-peak, above this temperature. When the surface
retaining â-H was exposed to C 2H6at 298 K, the TPD
2006 Chemical Reviews, 2001, Vol. 101, No. 7 Pen ˜a and Fierro
spectra revealed the complete disappearance of the
C2H2and C 2H4peaks and a considerable enhance-
ment of the C 2H6and CH 4peaks, with no shift in
their positions. Consumption of the â-H located at
the lower temperature side of âoccurred as a
consequence of contact with C 2H6, thus suggesting
that these H-species would be responsible for thehydrogenolysis and also for the hydrogenation ofC
2H4and C 2H2. Hydrogen was desorbed from the
LaFeO 3and LaAlO 3surfaces, and its TPD spectra
consisted of R- and â-peaks similar to those observed
for LaCoO 3. However, the desorption spectra of C 2H4
and C 2H6are relatively simple; only the original
molecules are observed. The H-preadsorbed LaFeO 3
and LaAlO 3surfaces convert the subsequently ad-
sorbed C 2H4only to C 2H6. On these surfaces, â-H is
also largely consumed. As revealed by photoelectronspectroscopy, reduction of Co
3+to Co2+occurs during
the reaction, resulting in a structural change and adrop of catalytic activity. By contrast, no significantchange in La 3d spectra is observed for any of thecatalysts in comparison with that seen for La
2O3.
TPD and XPS data point to the participation of
Co3+ions for the C -C bond cleavage during the
hydrogenolysis of alkanes.293H2, CO, and C 2H4
adsorption at room temperature provide a surfacesite density of 4 10
14cm-2on LaCoO 3, which
corresponds to about 40% of the total surface ions.These results suggest that most of the exposedsurface is available for the reaction and the (110) and(102) lattice planes are likely to be exposed at thesurface because of their higher thermodynamic sta-bility than the other planes. For hydrogenolysis, thegeometric arrangement of the (110) plane substanti-ates the co-functional role in which the C -C bond is
broken on the Co
3+, whereas the nearby O2-provides
H-adatoms to the resulting monocarbon species.These synergic effects by the lattice ions are evenmore pronounced in the hydrogenolysis of longeralkanes. The distance between the adjacent Co
3+in
the (110) plane is 0.542 nm. The C-atom chain ofbutane or higher alkanes is long and flexible enough
to interact with two Co
3+in a bridge form. Although
La3+and O2-fail to adsorb alkanes dissociatively,
both ions are likely to accommodate the methyl andcarbene groups formed as a result of the bond rup-ture. Thus, such a bridged adsorption makes thenearby La
3+and O2-effective in supplying H-atoms
to the decomposed species, thus lowering the activa-tion energy.
Crespin and Hall
102investigated the surface states
of several ABO 3perovskites and found that Co3+ions
in LaCoO 3are easily reduced to Co2+, but they reduce
to the metal (Co0) and La 2O3only at temperatures
as high as 773 K.102They also observed that the final
products of the reduction (Co0+La2O3) restore its
original perovskite structure by reoxidation at 673K. Using LaCoO
3prepared in the same way, Petunchi
et al.294reported changes in catalytic activity for C 2H4
hydrogenation, with an increase in the degree ofreduction of the oxide; maximum activity at 253 Kis observed on the LaCoO
3-xcatalyst at the x)0.7
composition for the first oxidation -reduction cycle
and at x)1.2 for the second cycle. The catalystprepared by Petunchi et al.294is more reducible than
that prepared by Crespin and Hall,102since the
catalyst of the former authors is reduced to someextent at 353 K. Ulla et al.
295proposed that the active
site of LaCoO 3would be highly dispersed Co0par-
ticles on the La 2O3surface.
A CNDO-MO calculation was performed for ethane
adsorbed on a linear atomic cluster, O -M-O-M-O
(M)Co, Fe, Al), which represents one part of the
(110) plane of perovskite.291The adsorption energy
of ethane and the change in C -C bond energy were
estimated by changing the distance between the axesof ethane and the cluster lying in parallel. In the caseof [Co -O] and [Fe -O] clusters, the energetically
stable adsorption takes place when the center of themolecule is located on the metal ion, whereas for the[Al-O] cluster the favorable position of the admol-
ecules shifts to the top of the central oxygen atom.The percentage decreases in the C -C bond energy
induced by adsorption at equilibrium distances areestimated at 3.7, 1.7, and 6.4% for the [Al -O],
[Fe-O], and [Co -O] clusters, respectively; the largest
value for the [Co -O] cluster reflects the strong ability
of LaCoO
3to break the C -C bond as compared to
the other two perovskites.
D. Photocatalysis
Perovskite oxides, in particular SrTiO 3, have com-
monly been used as photocatalysts because some ofthem can decompose H
2O into H 2and O 2with no
external bias potential.297This is because the conduc-
tion band (CB) edges of some of the perovskite oxidesare more negative than the H
+/H2energy level. Since
the photocatalytic activity is related to the surfaceproperties of these perovskites, powdered materialsrather than single crystals or films were used for thispurpose.

1. Photodecomposition of Water
Wrighton et al.297reported the photoassisted split-
ting of water molecule into H 2and O 2using a
photoelectrochemical cell having a SrTiO 3single-
crystal photoanode at zero applied potential. Hydro-gen evolution was also observed in experimentsconducted upon irradiation a SrTiO
3crystal coated
with alkali and in contact with water vapor.298In
addition, there are several works addressing thephotocatalytic decomposition of water over irradia-tiated SrTiO
3powders in suspension.299-301Lehn et
al.301found that SrTiO 3powders alone were unable
to split the water molecule into its components andthat a metal coating of the substrate was an essentialingredient to make H
2evolution observable.
Concerning different doping metals, Rh/SrTiO 3
system exhibited higher activity than SrTiO 3powders
coated with other transition metals. In general, theaim of metal coating is to decrease the H
2over-
voltage of the semiconductor, which, since it isusually very high, leads to low efficiency in thephotoreduction of water. The over-voltage can bedecreased by metal deposition. A metal-depositedsemiconductor acts as a “short-circuited” photoelec-trochemical cell, where oxidation and reduction reac-tions occur at two different sites, i.e., on the semi-Chemical Structures and Performance of Perovskite Oxides Chemical Reviews, 2001, Vol. 101, No. 7 2007
conductor and on the metal islands, respectively, of
the same particle. Metal deposition also decreases therecombination of photoproduced electrons and holesby enhancing the rate of electron transfer to themetal. Surface modifications of the SrTiO
3substrate
with an oxide such as NiO have also been at-tempted.
302Thus, working with the NiO/SrTiO 3pho-
tocatalyst H 2evolution was ascribed to formation of
some NiO/Ni domains, whereas O 2evolution came
from sites located at the SrTiO 3phase. It has been
suggested that the role of the nickel phase at theinterface is to enhance the transfer of electronsbetween NiO and SrTiO
3oxides.303
In all these investigations, commercially available
SrTiO 3powders were used, which have a particle size
ofg2ím. Since there is a clear particle size-
dependence of the band structure, and consequentlythe electronic properties of the semiconductor crys-tallites,
304it became imperative to prepare ultrafine
particles of SrTiO 3. Ultrafine powders of binary
oxides are not easy to obtain because of the hightemperature required for the reaction between therefractory components. Thampi et al.
305studied the
photocatalytic activity of SrTiO 3powders prepared
by the sol -gel technique. Kudo et al.306found that
photocatalytic activity was strongly dependent uponthe calcination temperature of SrTiO
3and the opti-
mum calcination temperature is different for differentreactions.
Mitsui et al.
307found that the activity of KTaO 3for
the photocatalytic splitting of water was greatlyimproved by partially substituting Ta with a tetra-valent cation M
4+(Ti4+,Z r4+,H f4+). The formation
rate of both H 2and O 2as a function of the amount of
Ti4+substituting the Ta site of KTaO 3reached the
maximum value for a substitution degree of x)0.08.
The formation rate of H 2at that optimized composi-
tion (KTa 0.92Ti0.08O2.96) attained a value of 100 ímol
h-1g-1, which in turn proved to be higher than that
of Zr4+-o rH f4+-substituted counterparts, while the
formation rate of O 2was slightly lower than half the
H2formation rate (Figure 13). The electronic spectra
of all M4+-substituted samples revealed no change in
the band gap (ca. 3.8 eV); however, their electricconductivity decreased by substituting Ta
5+with M4+.Therefore, it seems likely that the M4+element acts
as a charge carrier annihilator, and it is expected thatthe life of photoexcited electron and hole will beimproved by decreasing charge density. Thus, theformation rate of H
2was enhanced by partially
substituting Ta5+with M4+ions. On the other hand,
carrier density would become insufficient owing tothe incorporation of M
4+ion annihilator, with the
subsequent drop in photocatalytic activity.
Very recently, Kudo and Kato308reported enhanced
activities of water splitting over NiO/NaTaO 3photo-
catalysts doped with low amounts of lanthanideoxides. Lanthanum oxide was the most effectivedopant with apparent quantum yields approaching50%. Scanning electron microscopy observations sug-gested that the effects on the catalytic properties aremainly due to the decrease in the particle size andthe characteristic step structure created by thedoping. As the particle size is decreased, the prob-ability of the surface reaction of electrons and holeswith water molecules is increased in comparison withrecombination in the bulk, resulting in an increasein the photocatalytic activity for water splitting. Thephotocatalytic activity was decreased when Eu andYb were doped into NiO/NaTaO
3. This effect may be
explained considering that the tantalate photocata-lysts has high conduction band levels.
309The Eu3+
and Yb3+can trap the photogenerated electron in the
high conduction band levels of NaTaO 3because they
can take a divalent oxidation number. Such electron
capture suppresses the supply of electrons to NiOcocatalyst, resulting in a decrease in the photocata-lytic activity.
Ion-exchangeable layered perovskites of the type
K
2La2Ti3O10are also attractive water-splitting pho-
tocatalysts.310The structure basically consists of two-
dimensional oxide sheets stacked along the caxis,
in which K+ions are located between the individual
sheets as interlayer cations to compensate for thenegative charge of the layer. The performance forwater splitting under UV irradiation of K
2La2Ti3O10
photocatalysts and their 3% Ni-loaded counterpartswas reported by Takata et al.
310The generation of
H2and O 2is observed in both cases, and this
increases almost linearly with the reaction time. ForNi-modified photocatalysts, activity becomes remark-ably enhanced, and the H
2:O2ratios approach the
stoichiometric value. A key feature of these layeredperovskites is their inability to absorb light in thevisible region because the oxides containing metalcations with a d
0electron configuration are wide gap
semiconductors. The incorporation of Pb into theselayered perovskites seems to be effective in extendingthe absorption edge into the visible region.
310The
edge of the valence band shifts to the negative sidesue to Pb incorporation probably because of thedonation of Pb6s electrons to the valence band, towhich O2p electrons contribute.
311This is illustrated
by the Pb-exchanged RbPb 2Nb 3O10photocatalyst,
which generates H 2from H 2O/CH 3OH mixtures even
under irradiation of light with a wavelength longerthan 400 nm.
Other highly donor-doped (110) layered perovskites
loaded with NiO have proved to be efficient photo-

catalysts for the water splitting under UV irradia-
tion.312,313These layered structures, with a generic
composition A mBmO3m+2(m)4, 5; A )Ca, Sr; B )
Nb, Ti), exhibited high quantum yields and stoichio-metric evolution of H
2and O 2. The high photocata-
lytic activity resulted from the specific layered struc-ture and the high concentration of donor levels ascompared with the bulk perovskite. When NiO wasincorporated into these perovskites, a significantenhancement in photocatalytic activity was observed.This improvement, which might be ascribed to therole of Ni in p -n junction between nickel and the
layered perovskite, was made possible by reductionof the Ni-loaded layered perovskite at 973 K andfurther oxidation at 473 K. The rates of H
2and O 2
production increased with the amount of Ni incor-porated up to 1 wt %. The nickel oxide, a p-typesemiconductor, and the perovskite oxide, an n-typesemiconductor, should absorb the sufficient photonsfor its band gap excitation so that the p -n junction
can operate properly. The high electron density ofthese donor-rich materials would create a narrowercharge depletion region of the semiconductor and anincreased band bending, which would allow moreefficient electron -hole separation and higher quan-
tum yields than the undoped counterparts.
2. Other Photocatalytic Reactions
Several titanates and cobaltites have been used for
the photocatalytic oxidation of CO.314,315A strong
photocatalytic effect was observed over BaTiO 3and
SrTiO 3samples, whereas no effect was detected over
the easily reducible oxide LaCoO 3. Activity was found
to depend on the preparative source of the photo-catalyst.
Photocatalytic synthesis of NH
3from N 2and H 2O
was performed over SrTiO 3and binary-wafered cata-
lysts of SrTiO 3and platinum black,316where the
copolymer of ethylene and vinyl alcohol was studiedas a binder. The yield of NH
3was larger in the case
of the binary-wafered catalyst than the semiconduc-tor powdered catalyst alone. The photosynthesis ofNH
3and its subsequent photodecomposition were
investigated over Ba and Sr-titanates.317The rate of
NH 3production from H 2O and N 2mixtures was found
to be very small on the undoped BaTiO 3and SrTiO 3
perovskites. The decomposition of water was stronglyenhanced upon NiO doping of the SrTiO
3substrate
although the yield of NH 3remained very small. On
the other hand, the amount of NH 3formation in-
creased significantly for the doubly doped RuO 2-
NiO -BaTiO 3and RuO 2-NiO -SrTiO 3samples. This
enhancement can be attributed to the increasedactivites of NiO for H
2generation and RuO 2for N 2
activation. These findings also demonstrated that thethermodynamically unfavorable reaction of NH
3for-
mation from N 2and H 2O can be produced under
band-gap irradiation of these catalysts. Finally, itshould be stressed that photodecomposition of am-monia becomes correspondingly important when thepartial pressure of NH
3in the cell is high.
E. Chemical Sensors
The development of reliable and selective solid-
state gas sensors is crucial for many industrialapplications, among which environmental monitoring
remains prominent.318A number of perovskite oxides
(ABO 3) have been used as gas sensor materials
because of their stability in thermal and chemicalatmospheres. Since the gas-sensing function of semi-conducting oxides mainly utilizes the change in theresistivity of semiconducting oxides under adsorptionof gases, it is essential to understand several physicalparameters, including the electrical conductivity, todevelop gas sensors using perovskite oxides. Mostperovskite-type LnBO
3compounds are semiconduc-
tors, although LaNiO 3and LaTiO 3display metallic
conductivity.319LaCoO 3behaves as a semiconductor
below 398 K because it mainly contains low spin CoIII,
with a random distribution of high spin Co3+.320In
the 398 <T<1210 K temperature range, conductiv-
ity increases much more rapidly with an increase inthe temperature and is metallic above 1210 K, sincethe transition from localized to itinerant e
gelectrons
occurs in the form of a first-order phase transition.321
Substantial changes occur in the conductivity of
perovskite systems upon adsorption of gases on theirsurfaces. When reducing gases (CO, CH
3OH) are
adsorbed on p-type LnMO 3(M)Mn, Cr, Co) oxides,
conductivity decreases.322This phenomenon can be
represented by the following equations:
where (ad) denotes adsorbed species and (g) denotes
a gaseous species. Since an electron is released uponadsorption, chemisorption of the reducing gasesresults in the loss of a conductivity hole throughinteraction with this free electron. These equationsmean that the catalytic reaction occurs on the surfaceof perovskite oxides.
The application of gas sensors is limited by the
stability of the perovskite phase in a reducing atmo-sphere at high temperatures. The stability of a seriesof perovskite-type oxides LaBO
3(B)V, Cr, Mn, Fe,
Co, Ni) was investigated by Nakamura et al.18at
1273 K in gas mixtures of CO 2/H2. The stability
sequence of these oxides was found to be LaCrO 3>
LaVO 3>LaFeO 3>LaMnO 3>LaCoO 3>LaNiO 3.
Obayashi et al.323employed (Ln, M)BO 3(Ln )rare
earth, M )alkaline earth metal, and B )transition
metal) to detect ethanol in exhaled air. In thepresence of ethanol vapor, the electrical conductivityof these oxides changes drastically. This was the firstexample of perovskite oxides applied as gas sensors.
The activity for methanol sensing was found to be
high for the LnCrO
3and LnFeO 3series. It is clear
that the activities of these compounds are influencedby the transition metal ions and the rare earth ions.Rao and Bhide
324have suggested that the catalytic
properties of these cobaltites would be connected tothe spin states and, particularly, to the proportionof high-spin state Co
3+. It is noteworthy that the
activity of rare earth cobaltites is the greatest forSmCoO
3, which has the highest room temperature
ratio of high-spin to low-spin cobalt ions. In Ln 1-x-
AxBO 3systems, the introduction of alkaline earthCO(g)+O2-
(ad)fCO2 (ad) +2e-(24)
CH3OH(g)+3O2-
(ad)fCO2+2H2O(ad)+6e-(25)Chemical Structures and Performance of Perovskite Oxides Chemical Reviews, 2001, Vol. 101, No. 7 2009
ions results in the creation of a mobile hole. However,
gas sensing activity may not be appreciably influ-enced by the number of holes, but rather by the depthof the trap centers of holes in these perovskiteoxides.
325If Ln and A ions are fixed, B ions play a
role in determining the gas-sensing activity. In theSm
0.5Sr0.5MO 3system,324the activity of the Sm 0.5-
Sr0.5FeO 3compound is higher than that of the Sm 0.5-
Sr0.5CoO 3homologue if the activity is compared by
the response ratio alone. However, the Sm 0.5Sr0.5CoO 3
compound shows the best tradeoff characteristicsconcerning both the response ratio and response time.
Orthoferrites can be either p- or n-type semicon-
ductors, as indicated by Seebeck coefficient measure-ments.
326,327The n-type LnFeO 3compounds exhibit
a remarkable activity for methanol-sensing above theNe´el temperature ( T
N) of these oxides.328The sensing
activity appeared in the temperature ranges in whichthese oxides show paramagnetic behaviors. For then-type LnFeO
3oxides, activity increases as the radius
of the rare earth ion (Ln) decreases, while T N
decreases with a decrease in the radius of the Ln ion.Orthochromites exhibit p-type conduction and areantiferromagnetic at the Ne ´el temperature.
329TheTN
of orthochromites is lower than the TNof orthofer-
rites. The activity of orthochromites is expected toincrease with the decrease in the radius of the rareearth ion, as in the case of orthoferrites, since T
N
decreases going from La to Sm, i.e., 282, 214, and
190 K for LaCrO 3, NdCrO 3, and SmCrO 3, respec-
tively. However, there is no correlation betweenactivity and the Ne ´el temperature.
Ultrafine SmFeO
3powders have been used for the
preparation of thick films, screen-printed on aluminasubstrates.
330The electrical response of the films
prepared from pastes of different compositions of anorganic vehicle is very sensitive to CO and NO
2in
dry and wet air. However, the electrical conductivityand its activation energy, as well as the gas responseof the films, which had similar microstructure, werestrongly dependent on the composition of the organicvehicle. Since SmFeO
3is a p-type semiconductor,
unlike the commonly used n-type in gas sensors,there is an advantage for the detection of oxidizinggases, such as NO
2, and for the preparation of sensor
arrays for environmental monitoring or automotiveapplications.
Another application of perovskite oxides to gas
sensors has been the measurement of oxygen pres-sure in combustion control systems. The require-ments for controlling the fuel -air mixture to main-
tain a fixed concentration of excess oxygen, which iscalled “lean-burn control,” have received increasingattention with a view to increasing fuel efficiency aswell as reducing pollutant components in the exhaustgases of vehicle engines. These oxygen sensors aredivided into two groups, i.e., the solid electrolyte type,such as yttria-stabilized zirconia, and the semicon-ductor type such as titania
331or Co 1-xMg xO.332Sen-
sors using yttria-stabilized zirconia have been devel-oped for use in lean-burn oxygen sensors. Thesemiconductor type sensors utilizing electrical con-ductivity changes due to oxygen adsorption or de-sorption have been the object of considerable interestbecause of their simple structure and lower cost. TiO
2
was the first oxygen sensor of the semiconductor type
used for control of the stoichiometric fuel -air mixture
in car engine systems.333However, TiO 2cannot be
used for sensing elements in the lean-burn regionbecause the temperature coefficient of resistivity istoo high, although titania has as advantage asregards chemical stability. On the other hand, lean-burn oxygen sensors using p-type semiconductingoxides, i.e., CoO
334or Co 1-xMg xO-have the advantage
in the lean-burn regions since the resistance of theseoxides in such regions is low. Arai et al.
335,336observed
that SrMg 0.4Ti0.6O3, among SrA xTi1-xO3(A)Al, Mg),
exhibits the largest change in resistance at thestoichiometric point of combustion. To obtain excel-lent lean-burn oxygen sensor it is necessary tocontinue the search for new materials with higheroxygen sensitivity and stability even at an extremelylow oxygen partial pressure.
F. Electrocatalysis
1. Oxygen Reduction
Many semiconducting Pt-doped W bronzes,337,338
LaNiO 3perovskites,339-341and Sr-substituted Ln 1-x-
SrxNiO 3perovskites341-344are known to be effective
electrocatalysts for the oxygen generation reactionin strong alkaline solutions. The Tafel slopes ofoxygen generation appear to be dependent on theelectrode material. However, a common mechanismconsisting of the electrochemical adsorption of OH
-
followed by the electrochemical desorption of OH (therate-determining step), yielding H
2O2, as an inter-
mediate, which then undergoes catalytic decomposi-tion to O
2, seems to be operative.
The reduction of oxygen in alkaline solutions has
been chosen by several authors for kinetic investiga-tions involving the evaluation of the rate-determiningstep. This reaction has been studied on both metalsand metal oxides as electrode materials. Among thelatter, RuO
2remains prominent. On this oxide, the
reaction was found to occur with the participation oflattice oxygen.
345Bockris and Ottagawa343,344exam-
ined several substituted perovskites with a view tocorrelating their electrocatalytic properties with theelectronic structure of the transition ions on theperovskite surface. These authors suggested that themost likely mechanism in the alkaline generation ofO
2involves a rate-determining Mz-OH desorption
step, where Mzis an orbital perpendicular to the
surface of the transition element (M) in LnMO 3
perovskites.
Falcon et al.346,347and Carbonio et al.348have
reported good catalytic activity for H 2O2decomposi-
tion and oxygen reduction over the perovskite systemLaFe
xNi1-xO3. The rate constant of H 2O2decomposi-
tion at 295 K i na4MK O H solution displayed a
maximum for an x)0.25 substitution. This result
correlates with the isomer shift ( ä) variations for Fe3+
and Fe4+as measured by Mossbauer spectroscopy.
The difference in the isomer shift between the twotypes of iron sites (Fe
3+and Fe4+) also reaches a
maximum for x)0.25. Since the isomer shift is a
direct measurement of the electron density surround-2010 Chemical Reviews, 2001, Vol. 101, No. 7 Pen ˜a and Fierro
ing the nucleus, it can be concluded that there is a
maximum in the difference between the electrondensities for the Fe
3+and Fe4+sites in that composi-
tion. It is likely that both the mixed oxidation statesfor Fe and/or Ni and the unusual presence of Fe
4+
sites may be factors involved in promoting the
catalytic activity. In light of the classical explanationof H
2O2decomposition catalysis as proposed by
Latimer,349this correlation could be considered rea-
sonable. Any redox couple that falls in the potentialrange between the O
2/HO 2-and HO 2-/OH-couples
can, in principle, catalyze the decomposition reaction.The presence of both strongly oxidizing and stronglyreducing species in LaFe
xNi1-xO3might accelerate
the coupled HO 2-oxidation and reduction reactions.
2. Solid Oxide Fuel Cells
Some perovskites display good performance as
cathode materials in high temperature fuel cells.Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have recently attractedconsiderable interest as highly effective systems,efficiency ranging from 50 to 65%, and environmen-tally acceptable sources of electrical energy produc-tion.
319,350 -355The most common SOFCs feed fuels are
H2, CO, CH 4, and other hydrocarbons.355Moreover,
an important advantage of SOFCs is that they canoperate at temperatures at which the reaction ratesreach values of practical interest.
356There are sig-
nificant barriers to the reduction in the operatingtemperature of the SOFCs, i.e., electrolyte ohmicresistance and electrode overpotentials.
A representative electronic conductor is the La
1-xSrx-
MnO 3type perovskites that have been extensively
used as cathodes in ZrO 2-based SOFCs.357,358These
are good electronic conductors, but the lack of oxide-ion vacancies, and therefore of oxide-ion conductionat the working temperatures, makes it necessary touse thick, porous electrodes containing an array oftriple-phase boundaries where gas, electrolyte, andelectrode meet. The cathode overpotentials, i.e., 20 -
300 mV, of such cathodes depend on their micro-structure, which may change under the high tem-peratures required by the electrocatalytic reaction.By contrast, Sr-substituted cobaltites, La
1-xSrxCoO 3,
contain oxide-ion vacancies in the bulk even in anoxidizing environment. These mixed oxide-ion andelectronic conductors afford excellent cathode per-formance with very low overpotentials, even at highcurrent density, when present as a film on theelectrolyte.
359,360Apart from these advantages, the
thermal expansion of La 1-xSrxCoO 3perovskites is
very high and the mismatch between the electrodeand the electrolyte and interconnection makes thissystem unsuitable as cathode material for a SOFCssubject to repeated thermal cycling.
For decreasing the operating temperature, devel-
opment of the active catalysts for electrode is es-sentially required in addition to the development ofelectrolyte with low resistivity. Although La
3+cations
are generally used as the A-site cations of perovskitecathodes of SOFCs, rare earth cations used for theA-site of Mn-based perovskites have a great influenceon the electrical conductivity as well as the cathodicoverpotentials. Ishihara et al.
361found that the Sr-doped PrMnO 3perovskite exhibited a low overpoten-
tial in a low-temperature range around 973 K and athermal expansion coefficient consistent with YSZ.Although the mechanism for low overpotential on theSr-doped PrMnO
3is not clear, it seems likely that
PrMnO 3exhibits a high activity for the dissociation
of oxygen molecule into oxide ions. Rare earth cationsat the A-site in Co-based perovskite cathodes also hada significant effect on the power generation charac-teristics. In particular, a high power density couldbe attained in the temperature range from 973 to1273 K by using a doped SmCoO
3for the cathode.362
Sr-doped SmCoO 3exhibited the smallest cathodic
overpotential resulting in the highest power density.Power density of the cell was maximum when Sm
0.5-
Sr0.5CoO 3was used as the cathode.
It is of great importance for the intermediate
temperature SOFCs to develop new electrolyte ma-terials, which show a high oxide ion conduction overa wide range of oxygen partial pressures. It wasreported that the LaGaO
3-based perovskite oxides
exhibit high ion conductivity,363which is comparable
to that of CeO-based oxide. In particular, LaGaO 3
doped with Sr for La and Mg for Ga (denoted asLSGM) exhibits a high oxide ion conductivity stableover a wide range of oxygen pressures.
364,365Ishihara
et al.366prepared Fe-doped LSGM electrolyte and
found an increase in the power density of the fuelcell with respect to the undoped LSMG counterpart.This can be explained by the decrease in electricalresistance loss by improving the oxide ion conductiv-ity. A maximum power density close to 700 mW cm
-2
was obtained at 1073 K on the cell using an Fe-doped
LSGM and oxygen as electrolyte and oxidant, respec-tively, which is close to the theoretical open-circuitpotential. On the other hand, the power density wasslightly smaller than that of the cell using Co-dopedLSGM as electrolyte, especially at temperaturesbelow 973 K.
367This may result from the large
activation energy for ion conduction.
Tu et al.354prepared Ln 0.4Sr0.6Co0.8Fe0.2O3-ä(Ln )
La, Pr, Nd Sm, Gd) perovskites and found semicon-
ductor-like behavior at lower temperatures and me-tallic conduction at higher temperatures. Nd
0.4Sr0.6-
Co0.8Fe0.2O3-äexhibited the highest conductivity in
the 300 -1300 K temperature range and simulta-
neously showed the best catalytic activity for oxygenreduction at intermediate temperatures (870 -1070
K). A large thermal expansion mismatch betweenthese perovskite oxides and the 8% mol Y
2O3-doped
ZrO 2(YSZ) electrolyte was reported. The transforma-
tion of the Co4+and Fe4+states to the trivalent states
causes the precipitation of Sr at higher temperatures,resulting in the reaction of Sr with ZrO
2to form
SrZrO 3. The formation of an interfacial reaction
between the YSZ and calcium-substituted chromiteanodes was also observed during electrochemicaltests under fuel cell conditions. Using energy-dispersive X-rays and photoelectron spectroscopytechniques, Sfeir et al.
353showed that under such
reducing conditions, the Ca-substituted chromiteanodes are enriched with Ca and Cr at the surface.The CaCrO
4phase is believed to exsolve from these
materials and to decompose to CaCr 2O4and CaO,Chemical Structures and Performance of Perovskite Oxides Chemical Reviews, 2001, Vol. 101, No. 7 2011
which eventually reacts with the YSZ electrolyte to
form CaZrO 3. This phase segregation is also believed
to affect the activity of these anodes toward fueloxidation.
Other mixed-valent perovskites designed to display
a thermal expansion better matched to that of theelectrolyte and interconnection and also to be goodmixed electronic and oxide-ion conductors in anoxidizing environment at 970 <T<1300 K have
been explored.
319For this purpose, Huang et al.319
used the Ni3+/Ni2+redox couple in association with
the Fe4+/Fe3+and the low-spin/intermediate-spin
Co4+/Co3+couples in the perovskite structure. The
electric conductivity of both La 1-xSrxNi1-yCoyO3and
La1-xSrxNi1-yFeyO3perovskites appears to be po-
laronic with an overlap of the Co4+/Co3+and Ni3+/
Ni2+in the former and of Fe4+/Fe3+and Ni3+/Ni2+
couples in the latter. This overlap provides two types
of polaronic conduction, p-type and n-type, with thep-type carriers moving on the Co- or Fe-atom array,and the n-type carriers moving on the Ni-atom array.The compositions La
0.8Sr0.2Ni0.2Co0.8O3and La 0.7Sr0.3-
Ni0.2Fe0.8O3have a thermal expansion coefficient
better matched to that of the electrolyte than theexpansion coefficient of La
0.8Sr0.2CoO 3, and they show
a comparable electrode resistance at temperaturesabove 970 K. In contrast to the La
1-xSrxMnO 3cath-
ode, these oxides lose oxygen reversibly at temper-atures above 870 K, which makes them mixedelectronic/oxide-ion conductors with good catalyticactivity for oxygen reduction in SOFCs.
G. Structure −Activity Relationships
Precise knowledge of the relationships between
solid-state properties and catalytic performance iscrucial for the design and tailoring of efficient cata-lysts. In the search for these relationships, theavailability of families of isostructural perovskite-type oxides characterized by a great flexibility of thecrystal to accommodate cation substitutions is ex-tremely useful. There is no doubt that the structureand composition of ABO
3model perovskites facilitate
this arduous but extremely important task. Bychanging the A cation while keeping the B cationconstant, or vice versa, a series of compounds maybe synthesized with no substantial modification of thecrystal structure, provided that the conditions for thelower limits of the ionic radii are met and that therelationship between the ionic radii and the tolerancefactor ( t) as defined by Goldschmidt
7is obeyed.
The reduction of NO is an example of an intrafacial
process. This reaction occurs through dissociativechemisorption of the NO molecule on an oxygenvacancy ( 0) present on the surface of cobaltite and
manganite perovskites:
47,154
In this reaction, the reduced and oxidized surfacesare represented by [M- 0-M] and [M-O-M], respec-
tively. Lanthanum manganites provide a suitableexample of the effect of oxygen binding energy ontheir catalytic performance for the target reaction.On the basis of a thermodynamic approach to esti-mate the binding energy of surface oxygen in a series
of manganites, Voorhoeve et al.
368observed that
increasing activity for NO decomposition coincideswith the decreasing order of the binding energy ofsurface oxygen. This finding was taken as conclusivethat the binding energy of oxygen determines thenumber of oxygen vacancies (active sites) and henceactivity.
368Another example of the influence of the
binding energy between the oxygen and the lan-thanide cation has been reported by Futai et al.
95in
LnCoO 3(Ln )La-Dy) oxides. These authors found
a correlation between the sum of the Ln-O and Co-Obinding energies, reducibility, and the catalytic activ-ity in CO oxidation. Maximum activity correspondedto EuCoO
3, which exhibited the lowest oxygen bind-
ing energy and was also the oxide that proved to bethe easiest to reduce.
A correlation with the electronic parameters of the
perovskite oxide is, however, more appropriate insuprafacial catalytic processes.
368In these reactions,
the solid surface serves as a template providingelectronic orbitals of the proper energy and symmetryfor the bonding of reagents and intermediates.Sazonov et al.
369studied the oxygen equilibration:
on LaMO 3(M, first-row transition metal from Cr
through to Ni) oxides and found the rate and activa-tion energy of the oxygen equilibration above 500 Kto be maximum for LaMnO
3and LaCoO 3, very
similar in fact to those of simple oxides of transitionmetals (M
2O3). However, the temperature depen-
dence of the rate of equilibration on LnMO 3(Ln )
La, Nd, Sm) oxides below 500 K was found to be ofan identical nature to that recorded on the corre-sponding rare earth oxides. Thus, a distinct separa-tion of the functions of the cations of the transitionand rare earth elements can be seen for theseperovskites, i.e., activity is determined by the cationsof the transition metals at high temperature and bythe rare earth ions at low temperature. These resultsare in agreement with those reported by Kremenicet al.
49for propene and isobutene oxidation at 573 K
(Figure 8). The twin-peak patterns in catalytic activ-ity profiles resemble the twin-pattern which is foundon going from d
0to d10cations in the change in the
crystal field stabilization energy caused by the changein the coordination of surface M
3+cations upon
oxygen adsorption.370These results suggest a close
relationship between the electronic configuration ofthe transition metal ion (M) and catalytic activity.
The oxidation of CO with molecular oxygen has
also been suggested as an example of suprafacialprocesses. Voorhoeve et al.,
159,368,371Shimizu,372and
Tascon and Tejuca165have shown a volcano-type
dependence between the activity for CO oxidationand the electronic configuration of the transitionmetal ion. This is illustrated in the plot of catalyticactivity, either as the reciprocal of the reactiontemperature at which the activity is 1 ímol of CO
converted per square meter of catalyst per second oras the rate of mole CO transformed per unit area andunit time (Figure 14) as a function of the occupancy16O2+18O2f216O18O (27)

of the d levels for the transition M3+ion. Catalytic
activity is also influenced by its stoichiometry. InABO
3perovskites, a simple way of varying the
oxidation state of the B3+ion is by substitution of the
A3+ion by a different one with an oxidation state
other than 3. For (La,A ′)CoO 3systems, the appear-
ance of Co4+ions by substitution with A ′)Sr
decreases the rate, whereas the presence of Co2+ions
by introduction of A ′)Ce4+enhances the rate of CO
oxidation. Variations in the valence states can be alsoachieved by partial reduction, within the homogene-ity ranges of the perovskite systems.
According to crystal field theory, the octahedral
(truncated octahedron at the surface) environmentof the M
3+ions splits into two levels: the lower one
(t2g) contains orbitals that are repulsed less by
negative point charges than are the orbitals in thehigher energy ( e
g) level. In both cases, the maximum
activity in the volcano curves is attained for anoccupation of the e
glevels of less than one electron
whereas the t2glevels remain half-filled or completely
filled. This correlation can be understood in terms ofthe kinetic data, which show that the binding of COto the surface is a critical part of the process sincethe reaction rate varies with the partial pressure ofCO. Regarding the binding of CO as a carbonyl totransition metals, binding is optimal when donationof the carbon lone pair into the d
z2metal orbital and
simultaneous back-donation of t2gelectrons to the
antibonding ð* orbital of CO are possible.373The
correlation of the rate with the occupation of 3dorbitals is therefore consistent with the kinetic dataand a mechanistic view based on molecular orbitalarguments.
V. Future Perspectives
Historically, the initial interest of perovskites in
the middle 70s was focused on their application ascatalysts for removal of exhaust gases. However, this
impetus has declined, mainly because of their lowerresistance of perovskites to poisoning by sulfurdioxide as compared with noble metals. The knowl-edge of interactions of sulfur dioxide with the surfaceof perovskite oxides still remains limited, and most
of the conclusions regarding their behavior in a sulfurdioxide environment have been extrapolated from theavailable data from single oxides. This weaknesscertainly warrants further research on the subject.
The relationship between solid-state properties and
catalytic performance is crucial for the design andtailoring of efficient catalysts. The availability offamilies of isostructural perovskite-type oxides char-acterized by a great flexibility of the crystal toaccommodate cation substitutions, or anion vacan-cies, is extremely useful. This is illustrated by theformation heat of an oxygen vacancy in severalunsubstituted and substituted manganites whichappears to be related to the binding energies of thesurface oxygen to the A-sites. The increasing orderof values of this sum was found to coincide with thedecreasing order in catalytic activity for NO decom-position. This indicates that the binding energy ofoxygen determines the number of oxygen vacancies,and therefore the number of active sites, and hencethe activity of manganites in NO decomposition.Similar correlations between performance and solid-state properties are expected for catalytic reactionsin which O vacancies are involved.
Some perovskites display good performance as
cathode materials in high temperature fuel cells(SOFC), although inherent barriers to the reductionin operating temperature of the SOFCs must beovercome, i.e., electrolyte ohmic resistance and elec-trode overpotentials. Some Sr-substituted cobaltitescan act as mixed oxide-ion and electronic conductorsand afford excellent cathode performance with verylow overpotentials, even at high current density,when present as a film on the electrolyte. Apart fromthese advantages, the thermal expansion of thoseperovskites is very high, and the mismatch betweenthe electrode and the electrolyte and interconnectionmakes this system unsuitable as cathode material fora SOFCs subject to repeated thermal cycling. Thereis obviously a need to develop new mixed oxygenanion- and electron-conducting membranes derivedfrom perovskite structures for the production of new,clean energy vectors, e.g., hydrogen, and SOFCsapplications.
An important characteristic of perovskite oxides,
mentioned in the preceding sections, is their suscep-tibility of partial substitution in both A and Bpositions. Because of the wide range of ions andvalences which this simple crystal structure canaccommodate, the perovskites lend themselves tochemical tailoring. They are relatively simple tosynthesize because the flexibility of the structure todiverse chemistry. In light of the many possibilitiesof perovskites as catalysts, it is anticipated thatfurther investigations will expand the scope of cata-lytic perspectives examined in this review and con-tribute to the development of practical processes.
