Novel scanning synchrotron cross-sectional nanobeam and conventional laboratory as well as synchrotron Laplace X-ray diffraction methods are used to characterize residual stresses in exemplary 11.5 µm-thick TiN coatings. Both real and Laplace space approaches reveal a homogeneous tensile stress state and a very pronounced compressive stress gradient in as-deposited and blasted coatings, respectively. The unique capabilities of the cross-sectional approach operating with a beam size of 100 nm in diameter allow the analysis of stress variation with sub-micrometre resolution at arbitrary depths and the correlation of the stress evolution with the local coating microstructure. Finally, advantages and disadvantages of both approaches are extensively discussed.

1. Introduction
Protective hard coatings used for high-speed cutting and machining applications in the metal working industry possess complex depth gradients of phases, microstructure and residual stresses. Those gradients can be related to the effects of varying deposition conditions, self-organization phenomena like competitive grain growth, and/or post-deposition mechanical and thermal loads caused, for example, by friction between coating and counterpart (Ohring, 2002 ; Cavaleiro & De Hosson, 2006 ). X-ray diffraction (XRD) represents a common technique to evaluate residual stress gradients
along the surface normal
in polycrystalline thin films and coatings from measured X-ray elastic strains using the
technique (Noyan & Cohen, 1987 ; Hauk, 1997 ; Birkholz, 2006 ; Faurie
et al. , 2009 ). The inclination of the diffraction vector with respect to the sample normal is given by the angle
ψ . The measured lattice spacing
and X-ray elastic strains
represent volume-average quantities which depend on the actual stress
depth profile
, X-ray
penetration depth
τ , reflection
hkl
and experiment geometry. In general,
and
can be related as follows (Dölle & Hauk, 1979 ; Genzel, 1996 ): where
D
is the coating thickness and
d 0 ( h k l )
is the unstressed lattice parameter. By varying
τ
during a diffraction experiment it is possible to evaluate
and
dependencies experimentally in the so-called Laplace space. For the quantification of the stress gradient
from experimental
as a function of
z
in real space, however, it is necessary to solve a complex inverse problem similar to inverse Laplace transformation. Since the transformation between
and
is not ambiguously defined, it is necessary to make very strong assumptions about the actual nature of the
profile in real space (Birkholz, 2006 ). Recently, a novel XRD approach based on cross-sectional nanodiffraction was introduced (Keckes
et al. , 2012 ; Bartosik
et al. , 2013 ). The new technique uses synchrotron point (or pencil) X-ray nanobeams with a diameter (or thickness) down to 100 nm or even less to scan thin films at the
cross section
in transmission or reflection geometries. The advantage of the new scanning method is that the depth gradients of microstruc­ture, residual stresses and phases can be determined directly in real space as a function of the coating depth
z . The approach opens the possibility to analyse stresses in graded thin films (Bartosik
et al. , 2013 ) and correlate them with texture, crystallite size and phase gradients. The characteriza­tion of fibre texture is trivial, including also full orien­tation distribution function calculation, especially in the case of in-plane isotropic thin films with a fibre axis oriented perpendicular to the substrate surface (Heidelbach
et al. , 1999 ; Keckes
et al. , 2012 ). In this work residual stress gradients in exemplary as-deposited and blasted nanocrystalline TiN coatings were analysed (i) using the `classical' Laplace method based on diffraction in reflection geometry and performed in laboratory and synchrotron conditions and (ii) using the recently developed cross-sectional X-ray nanodiffraction approach providing the structural information in real space. The main aim of this work is to compare the two techniques and to discuss their advantages and disadvantages.
2. Experimental
2.1. Sample preparation
For the depostion of the TiN coating with a final thickness of 11.5 µm on monocrystalline Si(100) substrates, an industrial-sized plasma-assisted chemical vapour deposition and nitriding plant was used. The central component is a hot-wall reactor featuring wall temperatures of up to 873 K. The reactor is supplied with the process gases ( TiCl 4 ,
H 2 ,
N 2 ,
Ar ) by a standard gas mixing system using mass flow controllers. The plasma is sustained by applying direct current pulses to the substrates. For the deposition, a pressure of 200 Pa was applied. The deposition was carried out in two steps. The first 5 µm of the coating were grown using a substrate temperature of 813 K, and then the temperature was set to 853 K until the final thickness was reached. After the deposition, one coated substrate was blasted using
Al 2 O 3
particles with a diameter of 50 µm, applying a pressure of
4.0 ×10 5  Pa. The morphology of the as-deposited and blasted coatings was examined using
scanning electron microscopy
(SEM).
2.2. Laboratory monochromatic XRD
As-deposited and blasted coatings were characterized using a Rigaku SmartLab five-axis X-ray diffractometer equipped with Cu  K α
radiation, parallel beam optics and a secondary graphite monochromator. The measurements were conducted in side-inclination mode, scanning TiN 200 reflections at different sample tilt angles
ψ
in the
range of 0–0.98 in reflection geometry (Fig. 1 ). By tilting the samples around the
ψ
axis it was possible to vary the X-ray
penetration depth
τ . The
range corresponds to a
τ
range of approximately 0–1.9 µm, according to (Hauk, 1997 ; Birkholz, 2006 ) when considering a
Bragg angle
θ
of about 42.6° and a TiN
mass attenuation coefficient
of
cm −1
(NIST, 2013 ) for Cu  K
radiation. The lattice spacing
as a function of
τ
was evaluated with an error smaller than 10%.

X-ray elastic strains were characterized using the
method by measuring lattice spacing
d ( h k l )
at different sample tilt angles

along the direction of the diffraction vector
. The angle
ψ
represents the angle between the sample normal
and
. By varying the angle
ψ , the X-ray
penetration depth
τ
was tuned (Hauk, 1997 ; Birkholz, 2006 ).
2.3. Synchrotron energy dispersive XRD
Both TiN samples were characterized also at the Energy Dispersive Diffraction (EDDI) beamline of Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (BESSY), Germany (Genzel
et al. , 2007 ). The diffraction experiments were carried out using a white X-ray beam in the energy range 20−100 keV with beam dimensions of
500 ×500  µm in reflection geometry (Fig. 1 ). For the data acquisition, an
N 2 -cooled LEGe detector system from Canberry with a resolution of 160 eV at 10 keV and 420 eV at 100 keV was used. The acquisition was performed in a symmetric
configuration at a constant
Bragg angle
of
= 12° using a counting time of 60 s per recorded spectrum. The measurements were used to evaluate the lattice spacing
by measuring the positions of TiN 200 reflections at an energy of about 28 keV as a function of the sample tilt angle
ψ
(Fig. 1 ) (Genzel
et al. , 2004 ). The dependence of the lattice spacing
on
τ
was determined (with an error smaller than 10%) using equation (1)
by applying a
mass attenuation coefficient
of
cm −1
(NIST, 2013 ).
2.4. Cross-sectional synchrotron X-ray nanobeam experiment
The strain mapping experiment was conducted at the nanofocus extension of the ID13 beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France (Riekel
et al. , 2010 ). A schematic description of the experimental setup is presented in Fig. 2 . A monochromatic X-ray beam of energy
E
= 13  keV was focused using a Fresnel zone plate (Gorelick
et al. , 2010 ), providing a beam of 100 nm in diameter. Alternatively, using a nanofocusing parabolic refractive X-ray lens (Schroer
et al. , 2003 ), a (pencil-like) beam with dimensions of about
0.2 ×5  µm was applied. Both types of setup were tested in order to assess the influence of the beam shape on the diffraction statistics. Owing to the nanocrystalline nature of the coatings, there were, however, no significant differences in the diffraction statistics. In the following only results from experiments performed using a point focus will be presented.
Figure 2
A schematic view of the position-resolved XRD experiment carried out in transmission diffraction geometry using a monochromatic X-ray beam of 100 nm in diameter. The TiN coating on an Si(100) substrate (with a thickness
L
= 20  µm in the beam direction) was moved along the
z
axis with a step size of 100 nm, and diffraction data were collected using a CCD detector at a distance of 102 mm from the sample. The beam was aligned parallel to the sample interface using the
φ -axis movement. The TiN 111, 200 and 220 Debye–Scherrer rings represent diffraction from TiN crystallites. For a Debye–Scherrer ring, the diffraction vectors
are located on a bold line depicted schematically in the
stereographic projection
at the top. Note that for

.
The thin sample slice (with a thickness in the beam direction of
L
= 20  µm) was aligned with the film/substrate interface oriented parallel to the beam (Fig. 2 ) by using the
φ
axis. A CCD area detector with a resolution of 2048 pixels and a pixel size of about
50 ×50  µm was positioned behind the sample with a sample–detector distance of 102 mm. In order to vertically scan the film
cross section,
the sample was moved in the beam along the
z
axis with a step width of 100 nm. For each position, the CCD detector acquired a diffraction frame with a counting time of 0.5 s per frame. The two-dimensional diffraction data were processed using the program package
Fit2D
(Hammersley
et al. , 1996 ).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Sample surface morphology
Morphologies and cross sections of as-deposited and blasted TiN coatings were analysed using SEM ( cf.
Fig. 3 ). The blasting caused an increase in the surface roughness. The SEM cross sections reveal a nanocrystalline character of the coatings.
Figure 3
Surface and cross-section morphologies of as-deposited ( a ) and blasted ( b ) TiN hard coatings reveal a nanocrystalline nature of the coatings and an increase of surface roughness of the blasted coating ( b ).
3.2. Residual stress analysis in Laplace space
For the analysis of residual stresses as a function of coating depth
z
in as-deposited and blasted coatings, it was assumed that the stresses are equibiaxial with
and
( i
= 1, 2, 3)
and can be expressed by a parameter
. Similarly, for strains, it was supposed that only in-plane
and out-of-plane
strain components are nonzero (Noyan & Cohen, 1987 ; Keckes, 2005 ; Renault
et al. , 2003 ). As-deposited and blasted TiN coatings were characterized in the laboratory and at the synchrotron source by analysing the positions of TiN 200 reflections (Fig. 4 ). The nearly linear
dependencies with positive slopes collected from the as-deposited coating indicate relatively small tensile residual stresses. The different slopes of the dependencies obtained from the as-deposited coating can be interpreted as being caused by the presence of a stress gradient and/or by the different penetration depths of X-rays in the two experiments.

Lattice parameters as a function of
for as-deposited (0b) and blasted (4b) TiN coatings characterized in the laboratory (Lab) and at the EDDI beamline (EDDI). The data were obtained by evaluating the positions of the TiN 200 reflections.
The
dependencies collected from the blasted coating in both experiments show very pronounced curvatures, which can be interpreted as being caused by the strong gradients of residual stress
(Hauk, 1997 ; Scardi & Dong, 2001 ; Birkholz, 2006 ). The X-ray elastic strains
in the coatings were evaluated from
values from Fig. 4 , where the unstressed lattice parameter
d 0
was determined from the intercepts in the
plots. The biaxial rotational symmetric in-plane residual stress in the Laplace space
was determined from
using Hooke's law as applied in the X-ray diffraction residual stress analysis according to (Genzel, 1997 ; Birkholz, 2006 )
where
represents X-ray stress factors which depend on the material texture, single-crystal elastic constants, grain interaction, the TiN 200 reflection and the orientation of the diffraction vector (Dölle, 1979 ; Houtte & Buyser, 1993 ). Since the TiN thin films were in-plane isotropic and possessed a {100} fibre texture (Fig. 5 ), the stress factors
were for simplicity calculated according to (Genzel, 1997 )
where
s 11
= 2.17 ,
s 12
= -0.38 ,
s 44
= 5.96 ×10 -6  MPa −1
and
h k l
= 200
(Kress
et al. , 1978 ). Finally, lattice spacing data obtained from laboratory and synchrotron experiments (Fig. 4 ) were used to quantify residual stresses
in as-deposited and blasted samples in the Laplace space using equations (2) –(4)
(Fig. 6 ). Since in the case of the synchrotron experiment, performed using relatively hard X-rays, the maximal
penetration depth
τ
exceeds significantly the coating thickness
D , the `information depth'
is defined in order to express the origin of the measured information (Hauk, 1997 ; Genzel, 1997 ): The results from Fig. 6
document different penetration depths accessible at different facilities. In the case of laboratory measurements performed using Cu  K
radiation, the maximal
penetration depth
is about 2 µm, and for synchrotron experiments with much harder X-rays, the maximal information depth
approaches half of the coating thickness ( ) (Genzel, 2005 ).

and
were determined by using both Lab and EDDI data, except for the three EDDI measurement points at
in the range 0–2 µm. For the non-blasted sample the stresses are relatively homogeneous across the coating.
For the as-deposited coating,
data from Fig. 6
indicate a relatively constant tensile stress state of approximately
GPa across the coating. Unfortunately, the stress depth dependence in the interval
[ D /2, D ]
is not accessible (Genzel, 2005 ). In the case of the blasted coating, both laboratory and synchrotron
data (Fig. 6 ) indicate a decrease in stress with increasing
τ . In order to obtain residual stress dependencies
in real space for the blasted coating, it was assumed that the stress depth dependence can be approximately expressed by the exponential function (Hong
et al. , 2008 ) where
a ,
b ,
c
and
d
are numerical constants. The transformation of equation (6)
into Laplace space can be expressed as (Genzel, 1997 ; Scardi & Dong, 2001 ; Birkholz, 2006 )
By fitting the numerical parameters
a ,
b ,
c
and
d
from equation (7)
to the data of the blasted sample from Fig. 6 , it was possible to evaluate residual stress profiles
in Laplace space and also
in real space (Fig. 6 ). The
dependence was determined by using both laboratory and synchrotron data (except for the three measurement points from the synchrotron experiment on the blasted sample at
τ
in the range 0–2 µm). Finally, both
and
dependencies document an (expected) exponential decrease of the compressive residual stresses as a function of
z
in the blasted TiN.
3.3. Residual stress analysis in real space
Two-dimensional diffraction patterns obtained from the scanning X-ray nanodiffraction experiment (Fig. 2 ) were used to evaluate lattice spacing as a function of the diffraction vector
orientation and the coating depth. At first the Debye–Scherrer rings were integrated using the software
Fit2D
in order to analyse the positions of the TiN 200 reflection collected at different azimuthal angles
δ . In Fig. 7 , the depth development of the reflection positions
for
and 90° is presented. In the case of the as-deposited (unblasted) sample, Figs. 7 ( a ) and 7 ( c ) document that the peak positions do not change significantly across the entire coating thickness, which can be interpreted as an absence of a pronounced stress gradient. For the blasted sample, however, the peak positions move towards higher diffraction angles for
δ
= 90° (Fig. 7 d ) and smaller diffraction angles for
δ
= 0° (Fig. 7 b ) for coating depths in the range of about 0–2 µm. This is caused by a pronounced in-plane (near surface) compressive stress which induces a coating contraction in the in-plane direction, that is, a decrease of lattice spacing of crystallographic planes oriented with their normals parallel to the interface. However, the same stress causes an increase of lattice spacing of crystallographic planes oriented with their normals an angle
θ
with respect to the sample normal. The weak
increase ( cf.
Fig. 7 b ) and
decrease ( cf.
Fig. 7 d ) at depths of about 0.5 µm indicate the presence of a weak stress relaxation, which will be discussed further. Different broadening of the TiN 200 reflections for
δ
= 0° and
δ
= 90° indicate an anisotropic grain morphology (with needle-like crystallite shapes) and/or anisotropic strains of second and third order (Fig. 7 ). The abrupt changes in the peak width at depths of about 5.5 µm were caused by the change in the deposition temperature, which resulted in the growth of larger crystallites with fewer defects at a depth of about 0–5.5 µm.
Figure 7
TiN 200 reflections collected at different depths from as-deposited ( a ), ( c ) and blasted ( b ), ( d ) coatings depicted for two diffraction vector orientations
δ
= 0° ( ) and
δ
= 90° ( cf.
Fig. 2 ). The diffraction peak width varation across the depth is caused (i) by the blasting for depths of 0–2 µm in ( b ), ( d ) and (ii) by the deposition temperature change at about 5.5 µm depth in both samples.
In order to analyse the depth variation of crystallographic texture in the samples, intensities along TiN Debye–Scherrer rings
were evaluated. The three dimensional
data were transformed into
dependencies using a simple transformation from Heidelbach
et al.
(1999 ) linking
δ
and
ψ
angles ( cf.
Fig. 2 ): Since the coatings were in-plane isotropic (Fig. 5 ), the three-dimensional data collected from the blasted sample (Fig. 8 ) indicate the presence of a {100} fibre texture, in agreement with the laboratory measurements from Fig. 5 , where texture intensity changes slightly as a function of the coating depth
z . In principle, the three-dimensional data can be used to reconstruct the orientation distribution function for every
z
position [as done by Keckes
et al.
(2012 )]; this is, however, out of the scope of this work.
Figure 8
Depth variation of intensities along TiN ( a ) 200 and ( b ) 111 Debye–Scherrer rings in the blasted sample. In agreement with the data from Fig. 5 , the relatively strong intensities at
ψ
= 10 and 90° for TiN 200 and
° for TiN 111 document the presence of a {100} fibre texture whose intensity changes as a function of the depth. The increase in the texture sharpness at depths of about 0–5.5 µm was caused by the temperature increase during the deposition.
In order to analyse residual stresses in both coatings, three-dimensional dependencies of the lattice parameter
were evaluated from the positions of the TiN 200 reflections (Fig. 9 ). The results indicate that, in the as-deposited coating, the lattice parameter does not change significantly as a function of
δ
at distinct depths
z . In other words the slope
is relatively small. In the case of the blasted coating, however, the slope
is very pronounced for
, which indicates pronounced stresses in the blasted coating surface.
Figure 9
The variations of the lattice spacing
(evaluated from TiN 200 reflections) as a function of the coating depth and the angle
δ
indicate a relatively homogeneous stress state in the as-deposited coating ( a ) and pronounced residual stresses in the blasted coating surface ( b ).
The three-dimensional
dependencies (Fig. 9 ) cannot, however, be automatically used to evaluate residual stresses
in the coatings. As a result of the sample cutting, the residual stresses in the lamellae [with an intentionally selected small thickness of only 20 µm (Fig. 2 )] were partly relaxed and are not equibiaxial anymore, and therefore
as well as
. Generally, when for simplicity assuming only a biaxial stress state with negligible
,
and
, it can be shown that for the measured
lattice parameters and where
a 0 ( z )
are unstressed lattice parameters. For X-ray elastic constants
S 1 ( h k l )
and
, the following equations apply in the case of a {100} fibre texture (Genzel, 1997 ): For small Bragg angles
θ , the term
goes to zero, and therefore equations (9)
and (10)
can be simplified significantly. Moreover equation (10)
can be converted as follows: The term
from equation (12)
represents in this case the `measured' residual stress component (parallel to the long lamella
y
axis; Fig. 2 ), which can be evaluated easily from the distortion of Debye–Scherrer rings expressed by the term
. In the case of relatively thick lamellas, where the lamella thickness
L
is a few times the coating thickness
D ,
actually represents the depth dependence of the original equibiaxial stress component
, which was present in the coating before cutting. Therefore,
for
. For
, equation (12)
can be used to evaluate the original stresses in the coatings, with
only for samples where the stress relaxation across the coatings is constant,
i.e.
. This is the case for coatings and thin films on ductile and soft substrates. In the present specific case, of a lamella on a stiff substrate with the thickness
L
comparable to the coating thickness
D
( ), the strain components
as well as the stress component
change along the
x
axis at distinct coating depths
z , owing to the cutting. In other words, the
residual stresses relax in a considerable
volume fraction
of the lamella and cause a depth-dependent strain release. As a result,
also changes because of this relaxation, especially at the lamella borders (Fig. 10 ).
Figure 10
A FEM model documents a relaxation of
residual stresses (in GPa) in the blasted coating at the lamella
cross section
due to sample cutting ( a ). In ( b ) solid and dashed lines document the
stress magnitude along the
x
axis at different coating depths for the uncut sample and relaxed lamellae, respectively. One can observe that at the interface the relaxation is minimal, while at the surface the relaxation at the lamellae borders is very pronounced.
In order to investigate the effect of the residual stress relaxation due to sample cutting and to reconstruct the original stress state
in the blasted sample from
obtained from the nanodiffraction experiment [equation (12) ], a finite element model (FEM) was set up in the software package
ABAQUS
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abaqus). This model, in which the equibiaxial residual stress profile was applied to the coating as a predefined field, consisted of two steps. In the first step, the boundary conditions were chosen such that the coated sample behaved as if it had an infinite extension in the
x
and
y
directions. The sample was allowed to expand and curve in order to find its mechanical equilibrium. In the second step, the boundary conditions were modified so that a sample with 20 µm thickness in the
x
direction, like in the nanobeam experiment, was formed. In a first simulation, the stress profile obtained from the nanobeam experiment was applied to the uncut sample, and the relaxation after the cut was simulated. This gave a first impression of the relaxation taking place when the lamella is cut. Subsequently, the simulation was integrated in an iterative optimization procedure, altering the stress state applied as the predefined field until the stress state in the 20 µm-thick lamella matched with
obtained from the nanobeam experiment. Finally, the corrected biaxial stress distribution
was obtained from the simulation step modelling the uncut sample. The mechanical behaviour of the TiN coating was modelled using values of Young's modulus and Poisson's number of 428 GPa and 0.2 from Kress
et al.
(1978 ). In Fig. 11 , the evaluated residual stresses
obtained from the X-ray nanobeam experiment, the stresses obtained from the FEM procedure
and the stresses obtained from the Laplace technique
(Fig. 6 ) are presented for the blasted coating. Qualitatively,
,
and
indicate a relatively large magnitude of compressive residual stresses in the blasted coating near the surface and an exponential stress decrease towards the substrate. The comparison of
and
documents the intensity of the stress relaxation, which is significant especially in the coating surface, in agreement with Fig. 10 . Remarkably, the nanodiffraction data indicate a compressive stress maximum at
z
= 0.5 µm. Its presence is also visible in the raw data from Figs. 7
and 9 . This type of stress gradient has also been reported from simulations of the shot peening process (Hong
et al. , 2008 ). For the as-deposited coating, the stresses are tensile and relatively constant at about
GPa.

represents the recalculated stress profile using the FEM model. The stresses
in the as-deposited coating show a small variation across the thickness. The filled bands behind the
experimental dependencies document the measurement errors. The relatively small tensile stress increase in both samples at the depth of about 5.5 µm was caused by the temperature increase during the deposition.
In the
dependence, such local stress variation obviously cannot be resolved, which is a result of the form of equation (6)
as well as the principle of the method itself. The remarkable scattering of the first three points in the
τ
range of 0–2 µm obtained from the synchrotron experiment on the blasted sample (Fig. 6 ), however, indicates some irregular stress–depth behaviour, which could be caused by the compressive stress maximum at
z
= 0.5 µm (Fig. 11 ).
4. Discussion
The aim of this section is to discuss advantages and disadvantages of the Laplace and cross-sectional XRD approaches. Intentionally, a coating with a relatively simple stress
depth profile
was chosen in order to compare the two approaches. The main advantages of the Laplace approach are obviously the facts that no sample preparation is required and that it is possible to perform the experiments in the laboratory. The main restriction of the Laplace technique is the necessity to perform an inverse Laplace transformation of the measured
profile. For the transformation, the functional dependence of the residual stress in real space
must be pre-selected. In general, there are infinitely many
profiles in real space that would result in the same
dependence in the Laplace space and
vice versa . Moreover the often unknown depth dependences of the unstressed lattice parameter
d 0 ( h k l , z )
and/or
mass attenuation coefficient
μ , caused for example by chemical gradients, coating grain morphology and/or density variations, present also a serious problem for the
recalculation. The experimental determination of
d 0 ( h k l , z )
in nanocrystalline and/or graded thin films and coatings from X-ray elastic constants is very questionable. Practically, the Laplace technique can be used to analyse only relatively simple (monotonic) stress profiles
and is not sensitive to local stress variation. Given the nature of the method, an analysis of an oscillating or step-like stress field (Keckes
et al. , 2012 ) is practically impossible. In the case of the cross-sectional nanobeam approach, no assumptions about the existing stress profile have to be made. This novel technique allows the characterization of very complex stress gradients with step-like or even oscillating depth profiles. Moreover, this powerful approach can be used to evaluate for the first time not only stress but also representative microstructure (texture, crystallite size and defect density) and phase gradients in thin films and coatings. In this way, also the origins of stress evolution across the thickness can be studied and correlated with the deposition conditions (as in the present case) or with the thin-film thermal and/or loading history. It can be expected that this novel approach will allow the development of depth-dependent grain interaction models for thin films and coatings, whose application will be necessary in order to evaluate stresses in samples with strong texture gradients (Keckes
et al. , 2012 ). The main disadvantages of the new approach are the need for sample preparation, a synchrotron beamline providing an X-ray nanobeam and a relatively extensive data treatment, and the necessity to use a FEM model to recalculate the original stresses from the measured data in the case of thin lamellae structures, as in the present case. Currently, however, it is not necessary to perform the residual stress characterization only on thin lamellae with
. High-energy synchrotron X-ray beams and their high
brilliance
allow the measurements to be performed also on lamellae with a thickness
L
in the range of 100 µm or even more where the stress relaxation on both sides of the lamella (Fig. 10 ) is practically negligible. In future it can be expected that novel developments in focusing X-ray optics and beamline instrumentation with beam sizes in the sub-100 nm range will result in the possibility of performing even more local characterization of stress gradients. In that case, the application of pencil X-ray nanobeams for coatings and thin films with plain interfaces (Krywka
et al. , 2012 , 2013 ) will rapidly increase in importance in order to guarantee sufficient diffraction statistics, especially when looking for representative microstructure data.

Thin-film solar cells based on Methylammonium triiodideplumbate (CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 ) halide perovskites have recently shown remarkable performance. First-principle calculations show that CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
has unusual defect physics: (i) Different from common
p -type thin-film solar cell absorbers, it exhibits flexible conductivity from good
p -type, intrinsic to good
n -type depending on the growth conditions; (ii) Dominant intrinsic defects create only shallow levels, which partially explain the long electron-hole diffusion length and high open-circuit voltage in solar cell. The unusual defect properties can be attributed to the strong Pb lone-pair

orbital and I
p
orbital antibonding coupling and the high ionicity of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 .

Methylammonium triiodideplumbate (CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 )-based organometal halide perovskite has recently emerged as a promising solar photovoltaic absorber. 1–9
Recent reports have shown electron-hole diffusion lengths 8,9
as long as 1 micrometer in low-temperature solution processed halide perovskites. A planar heterojunction solar cell with a about 330 nm thick CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3−x Cl x
absorber layer has exhibited an energy conversion efficiency of over 15%. 5
More interestingly, the cell, which has the same configuration as other thin film solar cells, has shown a very high open circuit voltage (V oc ), more than 1.0 V. Considering a bandgap (E g ) of 1.5 eV, the V oc /E g
ratio is comparable to that of the best single-crystal GaAs thin film solar cell and outperforms that of the high efficiency polycrystalline thin-film solar cells such as Cu(In,Ga)Se 2
and CdTe.
The properties of defects, especially point defects, in absorbers play a critical role on determining the electron-hole diffusion length and V oc
of a solar cell. Defects that create deep levels usually act as Shockley-Read-Hall nonradiative recombination centers and are responsible for short minority carrier lifetime and thus low V oc . The long electron-hole diffusion length and high ratio of V oc /E g
indicate the unusual defect properties in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3.
On the other hand, the Shockley-Queisser limit 10
for single-junction solar cell based on an absorber with E g
of 1.5 eV should be close to 30%. To further improve the efficiency of halide perovskite-based thin-film solar cells, it is crucial to investigate thermodynamic stability of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
and the formation mechanisms of the dominant intrinsic defects.
In this Letter, we show by first-principles density-functional theory (DFT) calculation that the electrical conductivity of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
can be tuned from good
p -type to good
n -type by controlling growth conditions, i.e., the chemical potential of CH 3 NH 3 I and Pb sources. Such excellent dupability is not seen in CdTe, CuInSe 2
(CISe), and Cu 2 ZnSnS 4
(CZTS), which are intrinsically
p -type. The defects in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
with low formation energies create only shallow levels, whereas defects with deep levels have high formation energies, which explains well the long electron-hole diffusion length and high V oc . Such unusual defect properties can be attributed to the strong Pb lone-pair
s
orbital and I
p
orbital antibonding coupling and the high ionicity of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 . The narrow chemical potential region in thermodynamic stability indicates that the growth conditions must be carefully controlled to avoid the formation of secondary phases.
CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
have a cubic perovskite ABX 3
structure (space group
P m 3 ¯ m ⁠ ) at high temperature. Since the methylammonium ion, CH 3 NH 3 +
(MA) is noncentrosymmetric, the orientation of MA should be disordered to satisfy the high O h
symmetry. We find that the electronic structure and total energy of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
have very weak dependence on the orientation of MA ion due to van der Waals interactions between MA ion and three dimensional (3D) Pb-I framework. In this Letter, we have performed electronic structure calculations (band structure, density of states, and partial charge density) based on the perovskite unit cell containing 12 atoms with the orientation of MA lying along [111] direction. The defect calculations are based on a (3 × 3 × 3) supercell with the Γ point. The first-principles calculations are performed using VASP code 11
with the standard frozen-core projector augmented-wave (PAW) method. The cut-off energy for basis functions was 400 eV. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was used for exchange-correlation. Atomic positions are relaxed since all the forces on atoms are below 0.05 eV/Å. The effect of spin-orbital coupling (SOC) was previously reported in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 12
due to strong relativistic effect of Pb. However, the band gap errors of using GGA and non-SOC are cancelled with each other in occurrence. 13
Therefore, the GGA gives the experimental band gap without any underestimation and thus SOC was not considered in our calculations.
In perovskite CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 , CH 3 NH 3
and Pb donate one and two electrons, respectively, to three I ions, forming a band gap of 1.5 eV between unoccupied Pb
p
orbital and occupied I
p
orbital [see Figures
1(e)–1(h) ]. The CH 3 NH 3
molecule do not have any significant contribution around the band edge [Fig.
1(f) ] but donate one electron to Pb-I framework. It is noted that for a stable perovskite ABX 3 , the ion radius ratio (r A  + r X )/ 2 (r B  + r X ) is required to be close to 1 and thus the size of A atom is much larger than that of atom B. 14
For CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 , Pb is already a large atom and it is difficult to find single element A that is large enough to stabilize APbI 3 . Large-size organic ion CH 3 NH 3 +
can effectively stabilize this perovskite structures but do not make considerable contribution to the electronic structure of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
around the band edge. The conduction band minimum (CBM) of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
is mainly Pb
p
orbital with negligible coupling with I, indicating the ionicity of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
[Fig.
1(b) ]. The fully-occupied
s
orbital of Pb 2+
has strong antibonding coupling [Figs.
1(c) and 1(g) ] with I
p , making upper valence bands (VBs) dispersive [Fig.
1(d) ]. The band edge characters are also consistent with recent investigation. 15,16
The strong
s-p
antibonding coupling results in the small hole effective mass which is comparable with electron effective mass, making CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 -based perovskite an ideal candidate for thin-film solar cells with a
p-i-n
configuration.

In thermodynamic equilibrium growth conditions, the existence of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
should satisfy 17
μ C H 3 N H 3 + μ P b + 3 μ I = Δ H ( C H 3 N H 3 P b I 3 ) = − 5.26 eV , (1)
where
μ i
is the chemical potential of constitute element referred to its most stable phase and
Δ H ( C H 3 N H 3 P b I 3 )
is the formation enthalpy of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 . For
μ C H 3 N H 3 ⁠ , we choose body-centered-cubic phase of CH 3 NH 3
following Cs. To exclude the possible secondary phases PbI 2
and CH 3 NH 3 I (rock-salt phase), the following constraints must also be satisfied:
μ C H 3 N H 3 + μ I < Δ H ( C H 3 N H 3 I ) = − 2.87   eV , (2)
μ P b + 2 μ I < Δ H ( P b I 2 ) = − 2.11   eV . (3)
The chemical potential of Pb and I satisfying Eqs.
(1)–(3)
are shown as the red region in Figure
2 . This narrow and long chemical range indicate the growth conditions for synthesizing CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
phase in the equilibrium conditions. The narrow shape is in consistent with the low calculated dissociation energy (0.27 eV) of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
to CH 3 NH 3 I and PbI 2 , defined as E(CH 3 NH 3 I) + E(PbI 2 ) − E(CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 ), which indicates that the growth conditions should be carefully controlled to form the stoichiometric CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
perovskite phase. On the other hand, the long shape of chemical potential region provides the possible flexibility to tune the
n -type/ p -type properties during growth by controlling growth conditions, i.e., the chemical potential of CH 3 NH 3 I and Pb sources.

We have considered all the possible point defects including three vacancies (V MA , V Pb , V I ), three interstitial (MA i , Pb i , I i ), two cation substitutions (MA Pb , Pb MA ), and four antisite substitutions (MA I , Pb I , I MA , I Pb ). As the formation energies of point defects depend on the chemical potentials of the constituent element, we have chosen three representative points, A (I-rich/Pb-poor), B (moderate), C (I-poor/Pb-rich), in the chemical range shown in Figure
2
to study the defect properties. The formation energies of the considered point defects as a function of Fermi level position at chemical potentials A, B, and C are shown in Figs.
3(a)–3(c) , respectively. It is interesting to find that the conductivity of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
can be from intrinsic good
p -type, moderate to good
n -type when chemical potential is at A(I-rich/Pb-poor), B (moderate), or C (I-poor/Pb-rich). Such flexible defect properties are distinguished from conventional thin-film solar cell absorber CISe 18
and CZTS. 19
Donors in CIS and CZTS generally have much higher formation energies than acceptors. For example, the formation energies of donors Cu i
and In Cu
in CIS are more than 2 eV higher than acceptor V Cu . Thus, V Cu
dominates the conductivity of CISe. 18
In CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 , the dominant donor MA i
and dominant acceptor V Pb
have comparable formation energies. The low formation energy of V Pb
in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
is due to the energetically unfavorable
s-p
antibonding coupling, which resembles the
p-d
antibonding coupling in CISe. 18
The fully occupied antibonding state between Pb
s
and I
p
coupling does not gain electronic energy thus tends to bond break and form a vacancy. The lower formation energy of MA i
could be explained by its weak van der Waals interaction with Pb-I framework.

The transition level of a defect is the Fermi level position where the defect can donate/accept electrons. Therefore, the defect with transition level deep in the band gap will attract electron/hole and acts as Shockley-Read-Hall nonradiative recombination centers. The high performance of CIGS-based thin-film solar cell is partially attributed to its shallow dominant defects (V Cu ) with transition level only 0.03 eV above VBM. 18
In CZTS, the dominant defect (Cu Zn ) has a deeper transition level 0.10 eV above VBM, 19
which is considered as the possible reason for the low V oc
of CZTS. 20
The calculated transition levels for all considered point defects in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
are shown in Figure
4 . It is seen that the defects with low formation energies (Table
I ), such as MA i , V Pb , MA Pb , I i , V I , and V MA , have transition energies less than 0.05 eV above (below) VBM (CBM). On the other hand, all the defects that create deep levels, such as I Pb , I MA , Pb i , and Pb I , have high formation energies. Because only the defects with deep levels are responsible for non-radiative recombination, these formation energies strongly indicate that CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
should intrinsically have rather low nonradiative recombination rate, explaining the reported long electron-hole diffusion length. The shallow nature of dominant acceptors V Pb
and MA Pb
originates from antibonding state at VBM. Without Pb
s
lone-pair orbital, the VBM should be derived from I
p
orbital. The coupling between Pb lone pair
s
and I

orbital push the VBM up to a high level so that the acceptors are generally shallower than that without the strong
sp
coupling. The mechanism resembles the shallow V Cu
in CISe where the VBM is antibonding state of Cu
d
and Se
p . The shallow nature of dominant donors MA i
and V I
is due to the high ionicity of MA and Pb ions. As discussed before, the large-size MA ion helps to stabilize the perovskite structures and donate one electron to 3D Pb-I framework for charge balance. The MA i
has no covalent bonds to Pb-I framework and does not create additional gap states. As shown in Fig.
1(b) , the CBM of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
is mostly contributed from Pb
p
orbital exhibiting very weak covalence. Our previous study has shown that weak covalence generally leads to the shallow vacancy level. 21

It should be noted that the above results are calculated from pure CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
perovskite. In halide perovskite-based solar cells, the absorbers may not be pure perovskite phases. For example, secondary phases 22
may form in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 -based absorbers. The secondary phases may form defects that have low formation energies and produce deep defect states. Furthermore, the interfaces between the perovskite absorbers and contact oxides such as TiO 2
or ZnO may also form defects that produce trap states. 23,24
In conclusion, our calculations have shown that CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
exhibits unusual defect physics that are superior for solar photovoltaic applications. (i) The dominant defects are
p -type V Pb
and
n -type MA i . It is possible to control the growth condition to obtain the conductivity from good
p -type, intrinsic to good
n -type. (ii) Defects with low formation energies create only shallow levels, whereas defects with deep levels have high formation energies. (iii) The unusual defect properties were found to be due to the strong Pb lone-pair
s
orbital and I
p
orbital antibonding coupling and the high ionicity of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 . Our results suggest that careful control of the growth condition is the key to realize high efficiency thin-film solar cells based on halide perovskite absorbers.

Abstract
Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) tin-based halide perovskites have attracted intensive attention because of unique properties such as low-toxicity and low-cost processability. However, the uncontrollable crystallization of RP tin-based perovskites from solvents leads to less perfect crystal orientation and thus poor absorber layers with pinholes. Here, we propose an effective method to slow down crystallization kinetics
via
regulating the competition between intra- and intermolecular interactions in RP tin-based perovskites. Introducing an electron-rich heterocyclic thiophene rather than the traditional benzene ring into bulky spacers ( i.e. , 2-thiophenemethylammonium cation, abbreviated as TH + ) can decrease the intermolecular interaction between iodostannic sheets and spacer cations but increase intramolecular interactions in spacer cations. A weak intermolecular interaction increases the strength of electrostatic repulsion between charged colloids, and thus stabilizes colloids. Such stable colloids could retard sol–gel transition before crystal formation, offering a wider processing window for orderly crystal growth of RP tin-based perovskites. The interlayer heterocyclic spacer interaction induces a subsequently ordered self-assembly of gels to reduce morphological defects. The TH 2 FA 3 Sn 4 I 13
perovskite solar cell exhibits a two-fold improvement in power conversion efficiency compared to the control sample.

Abstract
In the past few decades, much effort was put into the development of synthetic strategies to produce nanoparticles of different sizes and morphologies and a large number of scientific contributions is dedicated to the characterization and application of metal nanoparticles. In contrast, only few studies deal with particle formation mechanisms. As a consequence, theoretical concepts that describe particle growth processes are very rare and the few existing models are hardly able to explain how synthesis parameters influence the final particle size distribution. This contribution discusses recent experimental results from which a novel growth concept based on colloidal stability is deduced. The growth concept is in contrast to nucleation models and allows a description of colloidal growth processes from a different perspective. It states that for most syntheses the minimal particle size is rather determined by colloidal than thermodynamic stability making a nucleation model irrelevant.

Materials chemistry Solar cells
Abstract Perovskite materials use earth-abundant elements, have low formation energies for deposition and are compatible with roll-to-roll and other high-volume manufacturing techniques. These features make perovskite solar cells (PSCs) suitable for terawatt-scale energy production with low production costs and low capital expenditure. Demonstrations of performance comparable to that of other thin-film photovoltaics (PVs) and improvements in laboratory-scale cell stability have recently made scale up of this PV technology an intense area of research focus. Here, we review recent progress and challenges in scaling up PSCs and related efforts to enable the terawatt-scale manufacturing and deployment of this PV technology. We discuss common device and module architectures, scalable deposition methods and progress in the scalable deposition of perovskite and charge-transport layers.

Introduction Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites have emerged as a revolutionary class of light-harvesting materials. The general perovskite formula is ABX 3 , in which A is a monovalent cation (such as methylammonium (MA + ), formamidinium (FA + ) or caesium (Cs + )), B is a divalent metallic cation (such as Pb 2+
or Sn 2+ ) and X is a halide (I − , Br −
or Cl − ). After only several years of active research, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has substantially increased to more than 22% 1 – 4 . Remarkably, this high performance was achieved with a device that was fabricated through solution processing, which has not been demonstrated for other photovoltaic (PV) technologies. This makes PSCs promising candidates for a high-performance, low-cost PV technology. Several intrinsic material properties contribute to the demonstrated high efficiency of this new PV technology, such as high absorption coefficients, long carrier diffusion lengths, flexible bandgap tuning and defect tolerance 5 – 10 . However, for practical application, PV technologies need to be more than efficient — they also need to be stable and scalable. During the past few years, we have seen remarkable progress towards future large-scale PSC manufacturing using scalable deposition. There has been a rapid improvement in the efficiency of PSCs at different size scales ( Fig. 1a ) — namely, small-area cells ( ∼ 0.1 cm 2 ), large-area cells ( ∼ 1 cm 2 ) and modules (>10 cm 2 ). The surge in performance of small-area devices is largely ascribed to the improved composition and morphology of perovskite thin films owing to innovations in solution chemistry and the fabrication process. These developments have been readily transferred to large-area devices, resulting in an increase in efficiency that has closely followed the trend of small-device development. By contrast, the efficiencies of PSC modules notably lag behind those of single-cell devices. Figure 1: Efficiency of perovskite solar cells. a

Full size image A loss in efficiency is inevitable when the solar cell or module area increases. This loss is the result of a combination of several factors, including higher series resistance, lower shunt resistance, non-uniform coating over a large area and the unavoidable dead (that is, inactive) area of bus bars and interconnections.
Figure 1b
shows the correlation between the state-of-the-art PCE and the solar cell or module area for different types of solar cells: silicon, cadmium telluride (CdTe), copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), organic PV (OPV) and a PSC. The different types of solar cells (except for the PSC) all follow an apparent inverse scaling law, with the absolute PCE value decreasing by about 0.8% when the device area increases by an order of magnitude. The current status of PSC modules falls below this predicted trend: there is a greater decrease in efficiency when the PSC area increases compared with other types of solar cells. This disparity in efficiency undoubtedly results from the minimal research efforts on the scaling of PSCs. Challenges in scaling up PSCs include developing scalable deposition strategies for the uniform coating of all device layers over large-area substrates, including the perovskite photoactive layer, electron-transport layer (ETL), hole-transport layer (HTL) and electrodes; achieving better control of film formation across the device stack at large scales by improving the precursor chemistry to better match the processing methods; and developing procedures for fabricating and integrating perovskite modules, as well as understanding the impact of device architecture on the performance of the module interconnections and the reliability and stability of module operation. Despite numerous challenges, the progress made towards scaling up PSCs is impressive. Small-area laboratory devices fabricated by scalable deposition (for example, by blade coating) have already reached PCE levels close to those fabricated by spin coating 11 – 13 . Although the PCE of perovskite modules still lags behind that of smaller devices, the rate of increase in the PCE of perovskite modules is unprecedented compared with other PV technologies 14
( Fig. 1a ). A perovskite module with a certified PCE of 16% and an area >16 cm 2
has recently been demonstrated 15 . In this Review, we focus on the key considerations for scaling PSCs and on the challenges for transitioning from the laboratory scale to the factory scale. We summarize common PSC and module architectures and then discuss efficiency losses that occur on moving from cells to modules as well as the importance of module design for achieving efficiency and stability. We compare various scalable deposition methods, including both solution-phase and vapour-phase depositions, their advantages and limitations with respect to PSC processing and the current status of the corresponding efforts to scale up PSCs. We provide an overview of recent progress in solution chemistry and processing control towards the scalable deposition of perovskite and charge-transport layers along with characterization techniques suitable for large-area perovskite absorber layers and module structures. Advances in the fabrication and characterization of large-area devices have greatly contributed to recent progress in scaling. Stability and cost are important issues to be addressed before PSCs can be commercialized. We discuss the strategies for improving the stability of PSCs and potential reliability issues facing PSC modules. Additionally, current reports on manufacturing cost analyses and life cycle assessments based on common PSC or module structures are summarized. Finally, we provide an outlook on the challenges associated with PSC scaling, with a focus on the scalability of processes and materials. Device architectures Perovskite solar cell architectures The most common device architectures for PSCs can be categorized into three types: mesoporous n–i–p, planar n–i–p and planar p–i–n ( Fig. 2a ).

Full size image The mesoporous n–i–p architecture was the first device architecture to be developed and has evolved notably from the early days of PSC research. A typical mesoporous PSC comprises an ETL scaffold with nanoscale pores. A perovskite absorber layer covers the scaffold, forming a compact capping layer and also penetrating into the scaffold, leading to an intermixed layer. The HTL and the top electrode are then sequentially deposited on the perovskite layer to complete the device stack. The mesoporous layer can facilitate charge separation and help suppress the notorious photocurrent–voltage ( J – V ) hysteresis phenomenon in PSCs 16 . A record PCE of 22.1% has been attained with a mesoporous structure 3 . The planar n–i–p architecture contains a compact ETL layer and thus does not feature the perovskite–ETL intermixed layer that is present in the mesoporous architecture. Although the planar structure is more prone to exhibiting
J – V
hysteresis, recent optimization of the ETL/perovskite interface has given rise to high-performance planar PSCs that show little hysteresis 17 – 21 . In this context, the mesoporous layer adds one more step to the fabrication process, which is perhaps unfavourable for scaling. It remains to be seen if the mesoporous scaffold is indispensable for achieving higher PCE or improved stability. It is worth noting that for certain n–i–p device architectures, the HTL layer can be eliminated by using carbon or gold electrodes 22 – 24 . The planar p–i–n architecture is generally referred to as an inverted structure because the carrier extraction layers are inverted with respect to the n–i–p structure. Devices with a p–i–n architecture are often constructed with a planar structure with a compact HTL. Perovskite solar modules As with other thin-film PV technologies, it is not practical to fabricate a single PSC on a large-area substrate because the parasitic resistance loss in the transparent conducting electrode is substantial over a long transport distance. Resistance losses can be managed by dividing a large cell into smaller sub-cells with series interconnections to form a module 25
( Fig. 2b ). The series interconnections sum the voltage available from the module. The interconnections occupy
∼ 3–10% of the module area, depending on the geometry of the interconnection layout. The interconnection area is inactive for power generation and thus is a major source of power loss in PV modules. The ratio between the photoactive area and the total area of a module is defined as the geometric fill factor (GFF) of the module. Modules with a higher GFF can generate more power for a given module size. Thus, a well-accepted practice for reporting module efficiency for conventional PV materials is to report the efficiency of a designated illumination area (or aperture area) that should include all interconnections 26
( Fig. 2c ). However, some perovskite module efficiencies are reported as the efficiencies limited to the active area, which excludes the area of the interconnections. In such cases, it is important to also report the GFF so that results can be accurately compared. For example, a module with an active-area efficiency of 15% and a GFF of 80% has an aperture efficiency of 12%. Thin-film PV modules (for example, CdTe and CIGS) are generally fabricated by first depositing the thin-film materials on one substrate and then separating individual cells by laser or mechanical scribing. There are three separation processes involved in module fabrication ( Fig. 2b ). In the first step, the bottom conducting electrode (for example, transparent conductive oxide (TCO)) is divided into parts to form isolated substrates for the individual sub-cells; in the second step, some of the active material (ETL, perovskite and HTL) is removed to construct interconnections between the sub-cells; and in the final step, the top electrodes and the edge of the module are isolated to separate the individual sub-cells and to define the outer boundaries of the module. PSCs can be processed into modules with a similar fabrication scheme. Scribing with lasers is highly desirable for industrial production, with the advantages of low cost, fast production rate and high GFF, which is associated with high precision and fine resolution. Perovskite modules fabricated through all-laser scribing have demonstrated a GFF of 94% 25 . However, perovskite materials are typically more thermally sensitive than other thin-film solar cell materials. Thus, one possible drawback of laser scribing is the potential for degradation and/or redeposition of materials near the scribe. Optimizing the sub-cell separation and module interconnection procedures for perovskite modules is important for scaling up PSCs and needs to be researched further. Another fabrication scheme for module assembly is to deposit each layer only at desired areas, thus requiring no additional scribing to form the interconnections. Such on-demand deposition can be realized through patterned printing and deposition with masks. However, patterned deposition requires pattern alignment for each layer to be deposited, and the spatial resolution is typically lower than with laser scribing. Thus, modules fabricated with this method normally exhibit a lower GFF and larger dead-area power loss. Scalable deposition methods To deposit perovskite films through solution processing, organic halides and lead halides are first dissolved in organic solvents such as
N , N -dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and γ-butyrolactone (GBL). These perovskite precursor solutions are used in both spin coating and scalable deposition methods. Spin coating is the most common method for perovskite thin-film deposition. However, it is generally limited to a scale of <10 cm, and a large portion (>90%) of the precursor ink is wasted in the process. Modules can be fabricated by spin coating on a substrate area of up to about 10 cm × 10 cm but with a considerably lower PCE than their smaller-area counterparts 27 . In spin coating, thinning and smoothing of the wet-solution films rely on the continuous centrifugal force from spinning, which is difficult to replicate in scalable deposition processes. Thus, the solution chemistry and processing conditions developed for spin coating cannot be easily applied in other scalable deposition methods. Furthering our understanding of the factors that affect thin-film formation and increasing our control of thin-film formation in different deposition processes are crucial for scaling up PSCs. Scalable solution deposition methods Scalable solution deposition methods for perovskite growth include, but are not limited to, blade coating, slot-die coating, meniscus coating, spray coating, inkjet printing, screen printing and electrodeposition. Here, we briefly compare these deposition methods as well as their use for PSC cell and module development. Blade coating . In the blade-coating deposition method, a blade is used to spread precursor solution on substrates to form wet thin films ( Fig. 3a ). The film thickness is generally controlled by several factors, including the concentration of the precursor ink, the gap between the blade and substrate, and the speed at which the blade moves across the substrate. This technique can be adapted for continuous fabrication with roll-to-roll setups, in which the blade is stationary and flexible substrates on a roller are in motion. The ink waste is substantially reduced compared with spin coating, especially in continuous roll-to-roll deposition. PSCs fabricated by blade coating have demonstrated PCEs >19% 11 , 12 . Figure 3: Common scalable solution deposition methods for the roll-to-roll fabrication of perovskite solar cells. Scalable methods for perovskite deposition include blade coating (panel

Full size image Slot-die coating . Slot-die coating ( Fig. 3b ) is similar to blade coating and uses an ink reservoir with a thin slit to apply ink over the substrate. Ink flow can be better controlled in slot-die coating, but this method normally requires larger quantities of ink to fill the ink reservoir and supply pipe and thus is generally less suitable for use in the development of new ink chemistries. As a result, slot-die coating has been less explored, and at present, the resultant PSCs have a much lower PCE than those fabricated through blade coating. However, slot-die coating shows better yield and reproducibility than blade coating when the ink is already fully developed. Thus, it has more potential to be applied in roll-to-roll fabrication in the future. It is noteworthy that both blade and slot-die coating use a moving meniscus liquid edge of precursor ink to spread the liquid film across the substrate. Some other non-conventional methods to create the meniscus edge are pulling a substrate out of a precursor ink (for example, dip coating) 28
and sheering a cover plate over the deposition substrate 29 . A recently reported soft-cover coating method also uses a meniscus edge for perovskite deposition. Before coating, a soft polymer sheet covers the coating substrate and traps the precursor ink between the layers. The meniscus liquid edge is formed and then moved as the polymer sheet is gradually peeled off. Uniform perovskite thin films of up to 51 cm 2
have been deposited using this soft-cover method 30 . Spray coating . In spray coating, a nozzle is used to disperse tiny liquid droplets onto substrates ( Fig. 3c ). Spray coating can be further classified according to the method used for generating droplets, such as pneumatic spraying (through fast gas flow), ultrasonic spraying (through ultrasonic vibration) or electrospraying (through electrical repulsion). Pneumatic spraying and ultrasonic spraying are commonly used for compact oxide layer deposition in PSCs. The perovskite layer can also be deposited by ultrasonic spraying 31 – 35 . Droplet size and placement are random in the spraying process, and several droplets need to overlap in a local area to ensure full coverage. Furthermore, new droplets can dissolve the already deposited materials, adding to the processing complexity. Keeping the substrate at an elevated temperature during spraying increases the rate of solvent evaporation and suppresses the redissolution of deposited material. The balance between solvent removal and material redissolution can be controlled by carefully tuning the solvent ratio and substrate temperature 34 . Electrospraying applies a high voltage between the spray nozzle and substrate. The droplets are smaller with electrical repulsion, and the electric field also increases the impact velocity of the droplets and the extent to which the droplets spread on substrates 36 . Inkjet printing . In inkjet printing, nozzles are used to disperse the precursor ink, with fine control of the droplet size and trajectory ( Fig. 3d ). Miniaturized nozzles and a short distance between the nozzles and substrate enable ultrafine lateral resolution, as demonstrated in digital printers. This patterning ability is suitable for printing electronics. Small-area PSCs (0.04 cm 2 ) have been fabricated using inkjet printing 37 . However, whether inkjet printing is suitable for the high-volume, large-area production of perovskite solar modules will depend on the printing speed and device structure. Screen printing . In screen printing, a patterned mesh screen is used to hold and transfer ink to the substrate ( Fig. 3e ). This method has good patterning ability with a lateral resolution of
∼ 75–100 μm (Ref.
38 ). The unwanted area of the mesh screen is blocked by the exposed photosensitive polymer emulsion, and the open holes of the mesh hold the viscous ink as a squeegee spreads ink across the screen. The ink is then transferred to the substrate to form the desired pattern. The thickness of the resulting film is determined by the mesh size and thickness of the emulsion layer. Screen printing is usually used to deposit thicker films ( ∼ 1–10 μm), and it has been used to fabricate mesoporous scaffolds and carbon back electrodes in PSCs 22 , 39 . Electrodeposition . Electrodeposition is another scalable solution deposition method to deposit thin films over a large area. There are no reports of the direct deposition of halide perovskites using electrodeposition, and it generally takes two steps to deposit perovskite thin films by electrodeposition. First, PbO 2
or PbO is electrodeposited on a conducting substrate. The lead oxide is then converted into a perovskite through reaction with organic halides 40
or reaction with HI acid to form PbI 2 , which is then converted into a perovskite 41 – 44 . The advantage of electrodeposition is the use of a non-toxic solvent (usually an aqueous solution) in the process. Table 1
summarizes different scalable deposition methods for preparing large-area perovskite thin films and their status in depositing charge-transport layers. Their roll-to-roll and patterning capabilities are also compared, together with the current state-of-the-art device performance for both single cells (aperture area ≤1 cm 2 ) and modules (aperture area ≥10 cm 2 ). Note that the certified record efficiency for a perovskite module (16.0%) is not listed here because the deposition method is not disclosed in the report 15 . A continuous fabrication line of PSCs may use multiple deposition techniques integrated together. Other deposition techniques have also been demonstrated for perovskite deposition, such as brush coating 45 , dip coating 28 , 46
and air-knife-assisted coating 47 . Table 1 Comparison of scalable solution processing methods for perovskite solar cells Full size table Vapour-phase deposition Vapour-phase deposition is common in solar cell fabrication: the deposition of CIGS and CdTe relies heavily on physical vapour deposition (PVD), and the doping of silicon is realized through chemical vapour deposition (CVD). A PVD apparatus for the large-scale fabrication of solar cells has been developed and successfully applied, and this experience and equipment have been readily translated to PSC fabrication. Perovskite thin films have been deposited with both PVD and CVD methods. PVD refers to the process in which a perovskite or its precursor is directly sublimated to form a perovskite thin film, whereas CVD refers to the process in which a lead halide is converted into a perovskite using organic halide vapours. The deposition of perovskite thin films using a PVD method was first demonstrated in 2013 (Ref.
48 ). Uniform and compact MAPbI 3 −
x Cl x
thin films were obtained by the co-evaporation of PbCl 2
and methylammonium iodide (MAI), enabling the construction of efficient planar PSCs. Ultrathin (50 nm) and large-area (5 cm × 5 cm) perovskite films, which are usually difficult to obtain by a solution method, were achieved using thermal evaporation 49 . In addition, PVD is a solvent-free method and largely independent of the substrate, making it attractive for the fabrication of perovskite–perovskite tandem devices. For example, an efficient MA 0.5 FA 0.5 Pb 0.75 Sn 0.25 I 3 /MAPbI 3
tandem device was fabricated by using solely thermal evaporation to directly deposit the MAPbI 3
sub-cell on the low-bandgap cell (MA 0.5 FA 0.5 Pb 0.75 Sn 0.25 I 3 ) 50 . The first CVD method developed for the deposition of perovskite materials involved the reaction of PbI 2
thin films with MAI vapour 51 . More CVD systems have been demonstrated with different chamber configurations and designs, environmental pressures, reaction temperatures and organic halide sources 52 – 54 . Towards the scaling of PSCs, CVD conversion has been used to deposit FAPbI 3
thin films on 5 cm × 5 cm substrates and to fabricate 12 cm 2
modules with a PCE of 9% 52 . Although vapour-phase deposition has the potential to be used to deposit perovskite thin films over large areas, these methods usually require more sophisticated vacuum equipment and longer processing times, which could potentially hinder their application for the low-cost fabrication of PSCs. Scaling up the absorber layer Nucleation and crystal-growth control The performance of PSCs depends greatly on the morphologies of the perovskite absorber layer. Scaling up PSCs requires coating perovskite thin films uniformly over large-area substrates without pinholes or other inhomogeneities. In an uncontrolled drying process, perovskite crystals tend to have preferential growth and form thin films with dendritic structures 55 , leading to poor surface coverage on the substrates and thus the formation of shunted paths in the solar cells. Strategies proposed to control nucleation and crystal growth to circumvent dendrite formation include physical approaches to promote supersaturation and chemical additives to control crystal growth ( Fig. 4 ). By applying these strategies, smooth and compact perovskite thin films that are suitable for large-area PSCs have been demonstrated. Figure 4: Strategies to control nucleation and film formation for scaling up perovskite absorber layers. a

Full size image Physical approaches to promote supersaturation . Rapid solvent removal from perovskite precursor solutions increases the supersaturation, leading to more nucleation and shorter grain growth times. A shorter growth time reduces the migration of the solute in the solution. Coupled with more nuclei, a shorter growth time suppresses the overgrowth of individual nuclei to form large dendritic structures. The rapid removal of solvent can be realized by anti-solvent extraction 16 , 56 , 57 , heating 46 , 58 , 59 , forced gas flow 47 , 60 , 61 , vacuum-assisted drying 62 – 64
or a combination of these physical approaches 65
( Fig. 4a ). Anti-solvent extraction is commonly used to achieve smooth, compact perovskite thin films. The anti-solvents need to be miscible with the solvents used to dissolve the perovskite precursors, but the perovskite itself should not be soluble in the anti-solvent. Using anti-solvents to extract solvents from the precursor solutions can lead to rapid supersaturation of the perovskite precursor film and fast precipitation of the perovskite materials. Examples of anti-solvents include toluene 16 , chlorobenzene 56 , ethyl ether 57 , ethyl acetate 66 , hexane 67
and anisole 68 . Anti-solvent extraction has been combined with spin-coating deposition by dripping the anti-solvent onto a spinning substrate covered with a perovskite precursor solution 16 . However, dripping anti-solvent during spin coating produces complex dynamics across the substrate, and more uniform results can be achieved by spraying the anti-solvent 69 . Anti-solvent spraying was used to fabricate a 16 cm 2
perovskite single cell with a PCE of 12.1% 70 . However, anti-solvent dripping and spraying have been deployed only with spin coating, and they are difficult to implement in scalable deposition. To address this challenge, anti-solvent bathing has been developed, in which the precursor film is soaked in a bath of anti-solvent for a short period of time 57 . In principle, anti-solvent bathing places no limit on the substrate size and could be incorporated in roll-to-roll continuous fabrication. Heating can also expedite solvent removal in the solution processing of perovskite thin films. For example, a hot-casting technique has been used to deposit perovskite films 58 . In this hot-casting process, a hot perovskite precursor solution (70 °C) was spin-coated on hot substrates (180 °C), forcing the solvents to rapidly evaporate. Because heating the substrate during large-area deposition is rather easy, this heating approach has been used to control the perovskite film morphology in blade coating, spray coating, dip coating and soft-cover coating 12 , 28 , 30 , 31 , 34 , 59 , 71 , 72 . For example, a pinhole-free perovskite thin film was obtained by heating the substrate close to the boiling point of the perovskite precursor solvent during blade coating 59 . Moreover, a hot dip-coating technique has been developed, in which hot substrates were dipped into a perovskite precursor solution and then drawn out, forming perovskite thin films in 2 s (Ref.
46 ). Forced gas flow and vacuum-assisted drying have also been used for rapid solvent removal. A forced gas flow was first used to induce fast crystallization during spin coating 60 . This concept was later adapted for slot-die coating, using an air blade to assist solvent drying 61 . A vacuum flash-drying method that uses a vacuum to extract solvent has also been reported. With the vacuum-assisted drying technique, large-area PSCs (>1 cm 2 ) with PCEs >20% were achieved 62 . In a further development, an apparatus was designed to simultaneously apply a low pressure and strong gas flow over the wet substrate; the combined effect of the gas flow and vacuum increased the solvent removal rate 65 . Recently, solvent systems with ultrafast evaporation rates have been reported for perovskite deposition. Methylamine (CH 3 NH 2 ) gas can considerably increase the solubility of MAI and PbI 2
in solvents by forming MAI– m CH 3 NH 2
( m
≤ 3) and PbX 2 – n CH 3 NH 2
( n
≤ 1) complexes 13 . Assisted by methylamine gas, perovskite precursors can be dissolved in normally poor perovskite solvents, such as acetonitrile. For example, in one study, methylamine gas was dissolved in acetonitrile, and this combined system was then used to dissolve a perovskite. The solvent evaporated quickly during spin coating of the perovskite precursor solution, facilitating fast crystallization of the perovskite at room temperature with an initial device reaching a PCE >18% 73 . Although this solvent system has so far been used only in spin coating, it should be applicable to large-scale deposition techniques, such as blade or slot-die coating. With an excess of methylamine gas, the MAPbI 3 –CH 3 NH 2
complex is liquid under ambient conditions 74 . The MAPbI 3 –CH 3 NH 2
liquid can be processed through solution methods and, as the excess methylamine can be rapidly removed, results in fast crystallization of the perovskite. This approach can be used to fabricate large-area devices; for example, a soft cover under high pressure was used to spread MAPbI 3 –CH 3 NH 2
liquid and to attain a uniform MAPbI 3
film over a large substrate (8 cm × 8 cm). A perovskite module fabricated with this method reached a certified aperture PCE of 12.1% ( ∼ 90% GFF) 13 . Chemical additives to control crystal growth . Nucleation and crystal growth are also strongly influenced by the chemistry of the perovskite precursors. The morphology of perovskite thin films can be tuned by varying the chemical composition or by introducing additives to the precursor solution ( Fig. 4b ). For example, perovskite thin films derived from a chloride-containing precursor (PbCl 2
+ 3MAI) showed better coverage and had a larger grain size than those obtained from a stoichiometric precursor (PbI 2
+ MAI) 75 . Other chloride additives (for example, MACl or NH 4 Cl) can also be used to prepare chloride-containing perovskite precursors, generating thin films with a morphology similar to those obtained with PbCl 2
(Refs
76 – 78 ). It is generally believed that Cl −
competes with I −
to coordinate to Pb 2+ , suppressing the formation of Pb–I–Pb plumbates and nuclei in the solution 55 , 79 . Chloride-containing additives slow nucleation and crystal-growth processes but also induce the formation of a chloride-containing intermediate phase after the solvent is removed. The film with an intermediate phase is less crystalline than a perovskite film directly deposited from a stoichiometric precursor (PbI 2
+ MAI), but it is usually less rough, with no dendrites or pinholes. The film compactness is preserved when the intermediate phase is transformed into the perovskite through the subsequent chemical reaction 80 , 81 . Chloride-containing non-stoichiometric precursors are often used in the spray, blade and slot-die coating of perovskite thin films 34 , 61 , 82 – 84 . In addition to chloride additives, other organic halides and Pb(CH 3 CO 2 ) 2
can be used as additives to induce the formation of an intermediate phase for growing uniform perovskite films 85 , 86 . A general reaction scheme for the conversion of the intermediate phase to the perovskite (MAPbI 3 ) has been proposed:

(Ref.
87 ). Hydrohalic acids (HCl, HBr and HI) are also used as additives to produce smooth perovskite thin films without anti-solvent treatment 88 – 92 . A hydrohalic acid has two roles in tuning the growth kinetics: first, the acid provides excess anions to coordinate to Pb 2+ , leading to the formation of an intermediate film after the solvent is removed 88 , and second, the acid lowers the pH of the precursor solution and breaks down small clusters and nuclei, thus suppressing nucleation and crystal growth 93 . Lewis acid–base theory defines acceptors and donors of electron pairs as Lewis acids and bases, respectively 94 . Pb(ɪɪ) halides are strong Lewis acids that readily form adducts with Lewis-basic solvents or additives. The formation of Lewis acid–base adducts in the precursor solution increases the solubility of lead halides and slows nucleation and crystal growth. By varying the basicity of the Lewis base and thus the strength of the interaction with the lead halide, the nucleation and crystal growth rates can be tuned. This approach can be used to improve the morphology of perovskite thin films. For example, the addition of DMSO or thiourea to a precursor solution of PbI 2
and MAI in DMF led to the formation of a Lewis acid–base adduct, and the morphology of the resultant thin film was greatly improved compared with the thin film obtained from the precursor solution without the Lewis-basic additive 95 . Other examples of Lewis-basic additives with the ability to modify perovskite thin-film morphologies are
N -cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidone 96 , hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) 97 , 1,8-diiodooctane 98
and thiosemicarbazide 99 . These additives have been demonstrated to improve the morphology of perovskite thin films, which would be beneficial for perovskite deposition over large-area substrates using various scalable deposition methods. Surface modification of the substrates is another way to control the perovskite film morphology. Decreasing the surface energy of the substrate decreases the heterogeneous nucleation energy of the perovskite and promotes nucleation on the substrate surface, leading to films that are more compact. A thin layer of perylene was used to modify the surface of PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate) to improve the surface coverage of the resulting perovskite thin films 100 . Self-assembled monolayer (SAM) modification of the substrate surface improves wetting of the precursors on the substrates and thus improves the uniformity of the resulting perovskite thin films 101 , 102 . In another example, a surfactant, such as poly(vinylpyrrolidone), was added to the perovskite precursors to improve the surface coverage and smoothness of MAPbI 3 −
x Cl x
thin films 103 . By contrast, non-wetting substrates were found to increase the perovskite grain size owing to larger spacing between the nuclei and easier grain-boundary migration associated with suppressed heterogeneous nucleation and a lower surface dragging force from the non-wetting substrates 104 . Two-step versus one-step deposition Perovskite thin films have also been deposited through a two-step deposition route in which a lead halide thin film is first deposited and then converted to the perovskite by reaction with organic halide salts 105 . In comparison with the direct coating of a perovskite (for example, MAPbI 3 ) precursor, two-step deposition can be used to fabricate more compact films over larger areas; it is generally easier to deposit uniform PbI 2
thin films than perovskite thin films over a large area, and in the second step, the volume expansion that accompanies the conversion of PbI 2
to the perovskite fills any pinholes in the thin films. This advantage could alleviate the complications of morphology control in one-step deposition, especially with scalable deposition processes. The two-step approach has been widely used in the slot-die 106 , electrodeposition 41 , 44
and spray coating 107 – 110
of perovskites. Large-area ( ∼ 1 cm 2 ) PSCs with 13.1% efficiency have been fabricated by two-step spray deposition 107 . Another advantage of two-step deposition is the increased processing tolerance to a humid environment. Efficient PSCs can be fabricated in humid conditions using two-step methods 111 , 112 . The results indicate that small amounts of water in the organic halide solution can assist grain growth in perovskite thin films 113 . One disadvantage of the two-step deposition method is the long and variable reaction time required to convert the lead halide into the perovskite. In early work with two-step deposition, the lead halide films were usually soaked in an organic halide solution for >10 min, and mesoporous scaffolds were required to facilitate organic halide penetration for faster reaction between the lead halide and the organic halide salt 105 . Two-step reactions on planar devices either result in incomplete reaction or require longer reaction times. The long reaction time and indispensability of the mesoporous layer have limited our ability to scale two-step deposition. However, the addition of Lewis-basic additives can increase the rate of reaction between the lead halide film and the organic halide. For example, adduct formation between PbI 2
and DMSO increased the reaction rate of PbI 2
with FAI through an intramolecular exchange mechanism: DMSO in the PbI 2 –DMSO complex readily exchanges with FAI, enabling the fast incorporation of FAI and thus rapid conversion to the perovskite 114 . This approach was used to fabricate PSCs with a record certified PCE of 22.1% and a 1 cm 2
device with a PCE of 19.7% 3 . Use of a Lewis base (for example,
N -methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) 115 , 116 , HMPA 117 , pyridine 118
or tributylphosphate 119 ) has also been shown to promote rapid and complete conversion of PbI 2
to the perovskite. Adding MAI to PbI 2
precursors pre-expands the volume of PbI 2
and suppresses the subsequent volume expansion from PbI 2
to the perovskite while also facilitating the PbI 2 –perovskite conversion 120 . All these strategies reduce the PbI 2 –perovskite reaction barrier and shorten the reaction time in two-step deposition, which may be useful in scaling two-step deposition for PSCs. Expanding processing windows It is necessary to control the precursor processing window (that is, the time required for the wet precursor film to dry to form a solid-state film) of perovskite deposition to ensure reproducible and scalable PSC fabrication. When anti-solvent extraction is used to control the morphology of perovskite thin films, there is a strict time window in which compact perovskite films can be attained by applying the anti-solvent. It is therefore crucial to match the time window of anti-solvent application to the precursor processing window. Otherwise, the solvent will evaporate during deposition over large-area substrates, and the opportunity for conducting anti-solvent extraction could easily be missed. One approach to extending the time taken for solvent evaporation is to use carefully selected mixtures of solvents. For example, a mixed solvent of GBL and DMSO takes longer to evaporate than DMF from perovskite precursor solutions, owing to the adduct formation between DMSO and PbI 2
(Ref.
16 ) ( Fig. 5a ). An even wider time window was achieved using a mixture of NMP and DMF, with an exceptionally long evaporation time of up to
∼ 8 min. The development of solvent mixtures with ultra-long evaporation times enables anti-solvent bathing after blade coating on a large-area substrate (up to 20 cm 2 ). A small-area (0.12 cm 2
aperture) device with a stable PCE of 19.05% and a module (12.6 cm 2
aperture) of PSCs with a PCE of
∼ 12% have been fabricated with blade coating and anti-solvent bathing 11 . Several solvent properties need to be considered when designing new solution chemistry: the boiling point and vapour pressure determine the evaporation rate of the solution, and the viscosity and surface tension affect the spreading of the precursor solution on substrates, with lower values favouring better wetting. Figure 5: Expanding processing windows, pulsed-light annealing and post-growth treatments for the fabrication of perovskite thin films. a
| Expanding the precursor processing window is necessary for scaling up perovskite absorber layer deposition. The processing window is the time period in which compact perovskite films can be attained by applying the anti-solvent. Dendritic structures start to form after the processing window. Processing windows can be increased by using solvent mixtures that are slower to evaporate.

Pulsed-light irradiation can be used to thermally anneal perovskite films and has led to a substantial decrease in the processing time relative to conventional heating approaches, such as the use of an oven or hot-plate. Thermal annealing can increase the crystallinity, increase the grain size and remove defects from perovskite thin films 123 .

Full size image The annealing process Thermal annealing is normally required after perovskite film deposition to increase crystallinity and grain size and to remove defects. These annealing steps are normally conducted using hot-plates and require prolonged processing times and extensive thermal energy. Annealing a perovskite layer usually takes 5–120 min. A long annealing time could negatively affect the production rate or make roll-to-roll fabrication lines impractically long. Adjusting the precursor chemistry (for example, using a MACl additive) has led to a substantial decrease in the required annealing times — from >10 min to <1 min (Ref.
11 ). Irradiation can be used to directly heat target materials, thereby reducing the processing time and the influence of heat on the underlying substrates. Therefore, irradiative heating is favourable for the roll-to-roll manufacturing of PSCs. Near-IR radiation was used to anneal a MAPbI 3 −
x Cl x
perovskite absorber and reduced the processing time from 45 min to 2.5 s without a notable loss in PV performance 121 . The processing time was further reduced to only 1.5 ms using intensive photonic flash sintering generated by xenon flash bulbs. However, this initial demonstration of an ultrafast process resulted in non-uniform films and lower PV performance 122 . The current status of intense pulsed-light sintering or annealing ( Fig. 5b ) was examined in a recent review 123 . In another example, rapid thermal annealing by halogen lamp irradiation was used on FAPbI 3
perovskite layers. FAPbI 3
has better heat resistivity than MAPbI 3 , which leads to better device reproducibility when treated with rapid thermal annealing. The optimal annealing time using the rapid thermal annealing approach was 40 s at 170 °C, a substantial decrease from the 10 min required using conventional hot-plates 124 . Post-growth treatment Film uniformity and high surface coverage of perovskite thin films are crucial to the production yield of efficient perovskite modules. Even with myriad approaches of addressing morphology and uniformity issues, perovskite deposition is still fundamentally sensitive to the processing conditions. The variation of processing conditions over a large-area substrate typically results in decreased module performance owing to local pinholes and structural defects. Eliminating such defects is therefore a requisite for large-scale fabrication. Post-growth treatments ( Fig. 5c ) that improve the reproducibility of the process and increase the process tolerance may also be key to successfully scaling PSC fabrication. An Ostwald ripening effect to heal structural defects in perovskite thin films has been demonstrated. MAPbI 3
films were treated with a dilute MABr solution ( ∼ 2 mg ml −1 ), followed by brief annealing at 150 °C (Ref.
125 ). The ripening process removed pinholes and increased the grain size and crystallinity of the perovskite thin film. Coalescence of small grains into larger grains can also be induced by annealing perovskite films in the vapour of polar solvents or organic halides. A reported DMF vapour annealing method increased the grain size and improved the electronic properties and PV performance of perovskite thin films 126 . Other polar solvents (for example, water, alcohols and DMSO) have been used for solvent annealing 127 – 129 . MAI vapour was also found to similarly induce grain growth in MAPbI 3
films 130 . A methylamine gas treatment approach can also be used to heal morphological defects in MAPbI 3
thin films 74 . Methylamine interacts with the perovskite and forms a liquid-state MAPbI 3 –CH 3 NH 2
intermediate phase that spreads smoothly on substrates. The methylamine gas treatment method can transform a poor-quality MAPbI 3
thin film with pinholes and dendritic structures into a smooth and compact thin film. Moreover, it can improve the device reproducibility of PSCs and increase the tolerance of the process to poor initial film morphology 131 . The microscopic structure of perovskite thin films can also be transformed with a pyridine (Py) gas treatment. Pyridine interacts reversibly with PbI 2
by forming a PbI 2 · x Py Lewis acid–base adduct, and the pyridine vapour recrystallizes the thin film when it is inserted and subsequently extracted from the perovskite lattice 132 . Scaling up the charge-transport layers Scalable deposition of the charge-transport layers (ETL and HTL) and the back electrode are also crucial to scaling up PSCs. The charge-transport layers should have appropriate interfacial energy alignment for charge transfer with the specific perovskite material and a suitable thickness and conductivity. Both inorganic and organic charge-transport materials have been used in PSCs. Common ETL materials in n–i–p PSCs include TiO 2 , SnO 2
and ZnO, as well as some doped oxides 133 – 135 . HTL materials in n–i–p PSCs are more diverse and include organic small molecules (for example, spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis( N , N -di- p -methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene)) 136 , polymers (for example, poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)) 137
and inorganic materials (for example, CuI and CuSCN) 138 , 139 . The ETL in p–i–n PSCs is usually composed of fullerene or one of its derivatives (for example, [6,6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) or indene–C 60
bisadduct (ICBA)) 140 , 141 . HTL materials for p–i–n PSCs include polymers (for example, PEDOT:PSS and PTAA) 104 , 140
and inorganic materials (for example, NiO x
and CuSCN) 142 , 143 . Large-area PSCs require a compact, uniform and pinhole-free charge-transport layer. Thermal stability, process complexity and energy and time consumption, which add to cost, are also important considerations for scaling. Many charge-transport materials in PSCs originate from the fields of DSSCs and OPVs. Thus, scalable deposition of these layers can benefit from knowledge gained in fabricating DSSC and OPV modules. Electron-transport layer The most common ETL in n–i–p PSCs is TiO 2 . A compact TiO 2
layer can be deposited by either spray pyrolysis or a sol–gel method on glass substrates. Vacuum-based processes, such as radio-frequency sputtering 144 , thermal oxidation of a sputtered titanium film 145
and electron-beam evaporation 146 , are also used to generate uniform and high-quality compact TiO 2
films over large areas, but these processes usually require high-temperature annealing, which is often undesirable for flexible polymer substrates. Compact TiO 2
layers have also been deposited by low-temperature techniques, including atomic layer deposition 147 , 148 , TiCl 4
chemical bath deposition 149 , hydrothermal reaction 150
and electrodeposition 151 . For example, a compact TiO 2
layer was deposited on an indium-doped tin oxide (ITO)-coated polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film using atomic layer deposition. UV irradiation was also used to selectively sinter a TiO 2
mesoporous scaffold without affecting the polymer substrate underneath. This selective irradiation sintering enabled the fabrication of PSC modules on flexible PET substrates of up to 30 cm 2
(Ref.
148 ). SnO 2
is another representative ETL material used for PSCs, and there are several reasons for replacing TiO 2
with SnO 2
in PSCs: SnO 2
has a higher open-circuit voltage ( V OC ), smaller
J – V
hysteresis and negligible photocatalytic effect, which is beneficial for the long-term stability of PSCs 134 , 152 , 153 . Despite these advantages, deploying SnO 2
in PSCs on a large scale is challenging. The optimized thickness of the SnO 2
layer in PSCs is thinner than that of TiO 2 ; thus, it is more challenging to obtain a pinhole-free layer, especially on rough fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates. When SnO 2
is processed at high temperatures, it is usually too crystalline and conductive, and therefore cannot be used as an effective ETL in PSCs. Thus, SnO 2
films are normally deposited with low-temperature sol–gel deposition, atomic layer deposition, chemical bath deposition, hydrothermal reaction, colloidal solution approach and electrodeposition processes 134 , 152 – 155 . Hole-transport layer PEDOT:PSS is widely used as the HTL in inverted PSCs. However, PEDOT is hygroscopic and absorbs water from the environment, which is detrimental to the stability of the PSC 156 . NiO x
is a popular alternative to PEDOT, and it can be deposited using scalable deposition techniques such as sol–gel, spray pyrolysis, atomic layer deposition, sputtering and electrodeposition 142 , 157 – 161 . NiO x -based HTLs are usually annealed at 300–500 °C to increase their crystallinity and conductivity. The high-temperature treatment hinders the use of NiO x -based HTLs on flexible substrates. To address this challenge, a room-temperature solution processing method was developed to deposit pre-synthesized NiO x
nanocrystals to form a high-quality compact layer, leading to flexible PSCs with a PCE of 14.5% 162 . In a similar two-step approach, NiO x
nanocrystals were prepared using the flame-spray method, which enables high-throughput synthesis ( ∼ 1 kg h −1 ) and requires no additional annealing step to form highly crystalline NiO x
nanocrystals 163 . CuSCN is also widely used as the HTL in PSCs and can be deposited by blade coating, spray coating and electrodeposition 139 , 143 , 164 . All these materials have the potential to be used in the scalable fabrication of perovskite modules. The perovskite absorber layer, ETL and HTL of a PSC can be deposited using scalable deposition methods, but most scaling studies have focused on the scalable deposition of just one or two of the functional layers. Only a few studies have demonstrated fully printable PSCs. In one example, only blade coating was used to fabricate PSCs with a structure of PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI 3 −
x Cl x
/PCBM/bis-C 60 /Ag. With this device structure, the PCE of a blade-coated PSC is comparable to the PCE of a spin-coated PSC (10.4% and 11.0%, respectively) 83 . In another example of a fully slot-die printed PSC, the molecular structure of the HTL was designed to improve the morphology of the printed HTL film. Bifluo-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis( N , N -di- p -methoxyphenyl)amine-9,9′-bifluorenylidene) is an analogue of the common HTL spiro-OMeTAD; bifluo-OMeTAD was designed to have a fully
π -conjugated structure and exhibits less crystalline aggregation, a smoother film morphology and higher substrate coverage than spiro-OMeTAD. With the bifluo-OMeTAD HTL, PSCs fabricated solely by slot-die coating exhibited a PCE of 14.7%, which is higher than their spiro-OMeTAD counterparts 165 . Although some progress has been made, more effort is clearly required to develop fully scalable deposition schemes for all device layers so that PSCs can make the transition from the laboratory to a deployable technology. Scalable deposition of the back electrode Back electrodes for PSCs are mostly deposited by thermal evaporation. Evaporation is a scalable process and has been used for producing aluminium-coated packaging foils. Sputtering has been less explored for electrode deposition in PSCs, although the process is more favourable for large-scale fabrication as it is less dependent on the vacuum level and generally has shorter processing times than evaporation. The greatest challenge is ion bombardment damage of the organic charge-transport layer, which can be mitigated by inserting an inorganic buffer layer (for example, ZnO or MoO x ) 166 , 167 . Sputtering can be used to deposit metallic films, alloys or more complex compounds, such as transparent conducting oxides (for example, ITO or aluminium-doped zinc oxide (AZO)), which are common in semi-transparent devices and tandem applications. Oxide-based back electrodes also provide stability benefits to PSCs, which are discussed in the following section. Vacuum-free processes for depositing back contacts are highly desirable to fully exploit the solution processing advantages of PSCs. The use of screen-printed silver electrodes in slot-die-coated PSCs yielded only a slightly lower PCE than cells with silver electrodes fabricated through evaporation (6.4% versus 7.9%, respectively), showing the potential of vacuum-free fabrication 84 . Silver nanowire networks (suitable for semi-transparent PSCs) can be deposited by spray coating 168 . Another example of vacuum-free deposition is the development of a flexible adhesive electrode consisting of a nickel mesh and a layer of a conductive PEDOT:PSS/acrylic adhesive 169 . The flexible electrode can be laminated and bonded to the solar cell with a conductive adhesive to transport charges. The lamination process does not affect the underlying perovskite or HTL layers, and this process can be deployed in roll-to-roll fabrication 169 . Carbon is also an excellent candidate material for PSC electrodes because it is abundant, inexpensive, chemically stable and environmentally benign. Different forms of carbon materials, including graphite, carbon soot, carbon nanotubes and graphene, have been demonstrated as back electrodes in PSCs 22 , 23 , 170 , 171 . One outstanding example is an architecture composed of mesoporous-TiO 2 /ZrO 2 /perovskite/carbon (carbon black and graphite), for which all the layers can be screen printed, thus making the device fully scalable 22 . A perovskite module with a carbon electrode has been fabricated on a 10 cm × 10 cm substrate with an active-area efficiency of more than 10% and with a GFF of
∼ 50% 172 , 173 . Subsequently, the GFF was further improved to above 60%, leading to a certified module PCE of 9.1% 174 . PSC and module stability Stability and reliability at the module level are crucial for ensuring the commercial success of perovskite PV technology. There has been substantial progress in improving the PSC stability at the cell level over the past few years ( Fig. 6a ) owing to continuous research effort and a better understanding of the degradation mechanisms. This topic has been thoroughly reviewed in several recent articles, in which more detailed information can be found 175 – 178 . In general, better PSC stability can be achieved with improvement across the device components by modifying the perovskite composition and the choice of charge-transport layers and electrode material. Recent demonstrations have shown the importance of the interfaces within the device. Further understanding of how the interfaces change over time along with associated degradation processes is needed to realize perovskite modules that have no stability issues 179 . Figure 6: Stability of perovskite solar cells and modules. a
| Over the past decade, there has been a rapid increase in the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) 178 . The average lifetime of a PSC has increased from hours in 2009 to about a year in 2017.

| The cubic structure of the formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI 3 ) perovskite is not stable and undergoes a phase transition to the non-photoactive hexagonal structure. The cubic structure of FAPbI 3
can be stabilized through tuning the perovskite structure tolerance factor (an empirical parameter used to predict stable perovskite crystal structures) by adjusting the effective radius of the A-site cation 182 .

and methylammonium iodide (MAI). The iodide-containing compounds released through perovskite decomposition react with the Ag electrode and form AgI.

Full size image Perovskite composition MAPbI 3
is prone to decomposing into PbI 2 , CH 3 NH 2
and HI upon exposure to heat or moisture 180 . FAPbI 3
has better resistance to heat and moisture, but pure FAPbI 3
is not stable in the cubic structure and tends to transform into a hexagonal structure and become non-photoactive. Alloying FA +
with smaller cations (for example, MA + , Cs +
or Rb + ) can stabilize the perovskite structure and suppress phase transition 181 – 183
( Fig. 6b ). Partially replacing I −
with Br −
(<15 mol%) has also been shown to improve stability 184 . A PSC with a FA-based mixed-cation (RbCsMAFA) perovskite showed impressive stability against heat and light soaking, retaining 95% of the initial PCE after ageing for 500 h at 85 °C with continuous illumination (AM1.5, one sun equivalent from a white light-emitting diode) under N 2
atmosphere 183 . Long-chain or bulky organic ammonium cations can passivate the perovskite surfaces and block moisture ingression 185 , 186 . A 2D−3D perovskite composed of both MA +
and butylammonium (BA + ) also exhibited a strong resistance against moisture-induced degradation, maintaining 70% of the initial PCE after 2,000 h of one-sun illumination under ambient conditions 187 . Charge-transport layers The stability of charge-transport layers and their interfaces with perovskite materials are crucial to the stability of PSCs 179 . The conventional ETL, TiO 2 , has a photocatalytic effect and can cause perovskite degradation under UV illumination. Better stability can be attained with alternative ETLs, such as SnO 2 , BaSnO 3
and chloride-treated TiO 2
nanoparticles 188 – 190 . Spiro-OMeTAD, the most commonly used HTL, can also introduce a stability issue in PSCs. Spiro-OMeTAD HTL films often have pinholes, which facilitates moisture ingression and leads to attack of the perovskite layer 165 , 191 . Lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) is often used as a dopant in spiro-OMeTAD to increase its conductivity. However, the hygroscopic LiTFSI dopant in spiro-OMeTAD films attracts water, and the Li +
ions are highly mobile and can migrate into the perovskite layer and potentially accelerate device degradation 192 . HTLs based on hydrophobic molecules and dopants have delivered improved stability 193 . Dopant-free polymer HTLs are also promising for the fabrication of stable PSCs 194 , 195 . Other potential HTLs for PSCs with long-term stability are inorganic HTLs, such as carbon nanotubes, NiO x , CuI and CuSCN, which are generally denser than their organic counterparts 138 , 196 – 198 . In one example, CuSCN was used as the HTL in a PSC, and the device achieved a lifetime of more than 1,000 h (retaining >95% of the initial PCE) under full-sun illumination at 85 °C (Ref.
198 ). Electrode materials Although the electrode materials are not in direct contact with the perovskite layer, the stability of the electrode materials is also important to the long-term operation of PSCs. Silver electrodes react with halides to form silver halides 199
( Fig. 6c ). Gold electrodes are more stable, but it has been shown that gold can diffuse into the perovskite layer and cause irreversible device degradation 200 . The degradation of the electrode materials could be more serious at the module scale than in a single cell, as the electrode material at the interconnection region is in direct contact with the perovskite, which can lead to faster corrosion. Metal oxides have better resistance against halide corrosion, and they can be used as barriers to protect the metal electrodes. Double-layer electrodes, such as Cr 2 O 3 /Cr, MoO x /Al and ZnO/Al, have shown improved stability in PSCs 156 , 201 , 202 . TCOs can also serve as back electrodes in PSCs. For example, ITO was shown to be more stable than metal electrodes in PSCs, with ITO both eliminating electrode corrosion and alleviating perovskite egression. Even with thermally unstable MAPbI 3 , devices with ITO electrodes yielded a
T 80
lifetime (the time taken to reach 80% of the initial efficiency) of 120 h at 100 °C, whereas cells based on metal electrodes failed within minutes 167 . PSCs with a porous carbon back electrode usually exhibit exceptional long-term stability (>1,000 h) under light and ambient conditions; the thick carbon electrode can effectively encapsulate the device, preventing external moisture ingress and internal perovskite egress 39 . A PSC with a carbon electrode, a glass seal and a UV-filter yielded a lifetime of 10,000 h at 55 °C (Ref.
172 ). Encapsulation In addition to continuously improving the stability of PSCs through advances in material properties, encapsulation can serve as extra protection against degradation. Encapsulation with, for example, a fluoropolymer, hydrophobic carbon electrode and/or metal oxide barrier layer has been used to improve the stability of PSCs to levels similar to those reported for devices operating under N 2
or another inert atmosphere 39 , 156 , 197 , 203 . In another example, FA 1 −

PSCs were encapsulated by two glass sheets, and the edges were sealed with commercial sealants (ethylene vinyl acetate and butyl rubber). These PSCs passed stability tests under the International Electrotechnical Commission’s damp–heat conditions (85 °C and 85% relative humidity for 1,000 h), validating other cell-level tests and demonstrating the promise of stabilizing PSCs using the encapsulation strategy 177 . Future research directions will include exploring low-cost and reliable encapsulation materials as well as developing processes to minimize the impact on modules during encapsulation. Module-related degradation Degradation at the module level is more complicated than at the single-cell level. In addition to the potential of additional processing-induced degradation pathways in the more complex production of modules, certain reliability concerns are unique to monolithically interconnected PSC modules, such as the halogen-induced degradation of module interconnections, degradation or module failure caused by partial shading and material fatigue and/or structure failure owing to ion migration. In a partially shaded module, the shaded cells are subjected to a high reverse bias, which could lead to local hot spots and inverted-bias junction damage 204 , 205
( Fig. 6d,e ). These same effects might also couple to intrinsic and extrinsic ionic conduction phenomena to change the module performance over time. Thus, it is necessary to investigate the stability of PSCs under reverse bias and in realistic module configurations. Characterization of modules When transitioning from laboratory-scale to module-level development, it is important to be able to evaluate and control the uniformity of the material properties at the film and device levels, the distribution of defects related to the material, device and operation, and the locations of shorts and shunts, as well as the interconnection properties in modules. Techniques suitable for characterizing and guiding the development of large-area perovskite thin-film solar cells and modules are discussed below. Composition, structure and properties Characterization of the composition, structure and properties of perovskites is important for developing PSC fabrication technology. The most common characterization techniques for small-area PSCs are X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV–vis spectrophotometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), optical microscopy, photoluminescence (PL) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy/UV photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS/UPS). These characterization techniques coupled with a mapping capability can be used to study the uniformity and homogeneity of perovskite thin films for large-area device and/or module development. High-speed inline optical imaging, UV–vis and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy ( Fig. 7a ) inspection technologies will be helpful for industrial fabrication, and they have been widely used for quality control in traditional PV fabrication. For example, an in situ X-ray scattering system was developed for a roll-to-roll perovskite coater. The system was used to study the formation and degradation of perovskites on flexible substrates, but it can also be used to investigate the crystalline uniformity of roll-to-roll-coated films 206 .

curves and incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) are mostly used to evaluate the performance of small-area devices. However,
J – V
and IPCE tests with spot-size illumination or a small-area electrode have been used to characterize the uniformity of large-area perovskite devices 59 , 62 , 83 . Light-beam-induced current (LBIC) mapping uses a small laser spot to scan the active area of solar cells and provides a local photocurrent generation profile of the device. LBIC mapping has been used to map an 8 cm 2
perovskite solar module; the inhomogeneous current distribution clearly revealed the non-uniformity of the perovskite films, thus indicating the need to improve the coating uniformity in future device optimization 207 . LBIC mapping is also used to investigate the degradation mechanism of PSCs under different ambient conditions 208
( Fig. 7b ). Photoemission spectroscopy and imaging Solar cells are optimized for light harvesting and subsequent carrier separation. Reversing the process, that is, applying a forward bias and injecting carriers into the device, leads to carrier recombination and photon emission. Electroluminescence (EL) is the basic working mechanism of semiconductor light-emitting diodes, and it can be used to study non-radiative recombination in PSCs and to predict the theoretical
V OC
limits of devices 209 , 210 . An EL imaging setup for a PSC is relatively simple because perovskites have a larger bandgap than silicon (the most common material used in charge-coupled device arrays), and the data acquisition speed in EL imaging is much faster than in LBIC mapping. An EL image can provide information about charge recombination at the nanoscale 211
and macroscopic charge-transport obstacles associated with non-uniformity, impurities, shunting and internal resistance 70 , 212 – 215 . EL and PL are usually used as complementary methods to reveal macroscopic defects in devices ( Fig. 6c ). Recombination centres, weak diodes and shunting regions suppress the radiative recombination of carriers; thus, they appear darker in the EL and PL images. Regions with higher contact resistance impede current injection and photon-generated carrier dissipation, resulting in weaker EL and stronger PL features in the images 175 , 178 . Lock-in thermography Lock-in thermography (LIT) is also a useful imaging tool for identifying local defects in solar cells ( Fig. 7c ). LIT can be operated in three modes, with each mode being sensitive to different types of defects. Illuminated LIT (ILIT) generates a photovoltage in solar cells with pulse illumination. When charge carriers recombine at the locations of recombination centres, weak diodes or shunting paths, heat is generated, which can be detected by an IR camera. Dark LIT (DLIT) can be operated at forward or reverse bias: DLIT fwd
detects heat at shunted spots, weak diode locations or regions with poor contact and high series resistance, whereas DLIT rev
is sensitive to shunts that conduct current at reverse bias 216 . Interconnections in modules In addition to the film and device uniformity, the interconnections are another key determinant of module operation. LIT in conjunction with EL and PL imaging is useful for identifying the shunting, shorts and high-resistance regions in individual sub-cells and interconnections in solar modules. In general, a shunted or shorted sub-cell appears darker in an EL image because the current passes through shunting points instead of the absorber layer. In this situation, a local hot spot appears at the shunting point owing to Joule heating, resulting in a brighter spot in the DLIT image. High sheet resistance or series resistance is also recognizable from DLIT images under high forward-injection conditions.
Figure 7d
shows EL and LIT images of an amorphous silicon thin-film solar module with one shorted sub-cell. The shorting location in the interconnection can be seen as a hot spot in the LIT image 217 . Module cost and life cycle assessment There are two main challenges for large-scale PV technologies: first, enabling the low-cost production of PV systems at scale and second, achieving sustainability (including ensuring resource availability and minimizing any negative environmental impact) in the case of terawatt-scale deployment 14 . Insight regarding the former has been gained through several cost model studies based on hypothesized device stacks and production workflows 218 – 220 . These studies show clear cost advantages of PSCs over other PV technologies. However, the various attempts to examine the cost competitiveness of PSCs must be viewed critically, because some of the device-stack configurations examined may not be feasible to implement at scale in the future. This points to a range of opportunities for innovations in device-stack configurations and/or materials for large-scale PSCs but also highlights the difficulty in undertaking realistic cost assessments of deployable PSCs at this nascent stage of technology development and with the present lack of certainty regarding module requirements (for example, encapsulation, weight and structure). Although there has been continued progress, the factor that remains most uncertain is the stability 218 . Life cycle assessments provide insight into the environmental impact and the sustainability of a particular PSC stack. Life cycle assessments rely on more well-established energy and CO 2
costs associated with materials production rather than direct monetary costs. The life cycle assessments of PSCs to date have looked at only a few (of the many) PSC architectures. In one study, an energy payback time of less than 0.3 years for PSCs with an n–i–p structure was calculated, which is much shorter than that of other PV technologies 221 . It is important to note the limited extent to which life cycle assessments have so far been used in comparing PSCs with other established technologies. In the context of terawatt-scale energy production and the development of a sustainable PV economy, the cost of production as well as the cost of refurbishing and/or disposing of any PV must also be considered. Challenges and outlook Although PSCs have already shown promise towards large-scale deployment, many challenges remain. Key materials and processing challenges include the fully scalable fabrication of all device layers and reliable schemes for module interconnection. These challenges are further complicated because the most ideal device architecture has not yet been identified; several architecture–materials combinations have shown high performance, with good progress in terms of stability at the cell level. In addition, the composition of perovskites has become increasingly complex for high efficiency and/or stability in laboratory-scale devices. Transferring the new material compositions to production scale requires more effort in process engineering because of changes in the material processing properties. Lowering the cost and environmental impact of the final PV modules will require further reductions in the cost and energy consumption of resource extraction, material synthesis and film processing for the different components in PSCs — especially for the noble metal electrode (gold), transparent conducting substrates (ITO or FTO), spiro-OMeTAD-based HTL and fullerene-based ETL. Some alternative materials with great potential have been proposed and demonstrated, such as double-layer MoO x /Al and Cr 2 O 3 /Cr back electrodes 201 , 222 . As perovskite technology matures, the ideal device architecture, with scalable materials, and module fabrication process will likely be identified. This will enable more reliable cost modelling and life cycle assessments of the suitability of perovskite PVs for terawatt-scale deployment. Finally, on the basis of the remarkable progress in the efficiency and stability of PSCs, it is increasingly important to consider these performance metrics in the context of scalability. We are still at an early stage of understanding and addressing the challenges of scaling up PSCs with respect to the myriad device stacks and effective schemes for module interconnection. However, the rapid development towards scaling up at a relevant performance level (efficiency and stability) coupled with the low-cost manufacturing capability has already attracted substantial industrial interest worldwide ( Table 2 ). The challenges for PSC scaling outline clear research needs that are informed by industry through the potential supply chain for PSCs to ensure that highly scalable choices are made at the same time that the efficiency and stability are improved. If these issues can be addressed, the potential for PSCs, compared with other PV technologies, to have an impact on global energy production at the terawatt scale is unrivalled.

Abstract
Lead-free halide double perovskites with enhanced stability have gained attention as a promising environmentally friendly alternative to lead-based halide perovskites. Amongst different halide double perovskites, Cs 2 AgBiBr 6
has shown attractive optoelectronic properties and stability, making it a promising candidate for stable high-efficiency optoelectronic devices. Motivated by a data mining effort, we present here the effects of different processing strategies on the microstructure and thin-film formation dynamics of Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 . We apply some of the most successfully used solvent engineering approaches from the halide perovskite research to halide double perovskites, namely antisolvent- and additive-assisted synthesis. Using
in situ
spectroscopy and diffraction, the film formation of Cs 2 AgBiBr 6
is investigated during spin coating, and the subsequent post-deposition thermal annealing. Dropping antisolvents during spin coating induces immediate supersaturation and crystallization of the wet film, whereas the time of dropping the antisolvent has implications on the film formation dynamics and the final microstructure. For additive (HBr)-assisted synthesis, we show how the addition of HBr affects colloid formation in solution and thus influences the crystallization pathway during thin-film processing. Finally, HBr additive simplifies synthesis in that it doesn't require solution and substrate preheating to obtain pinhole-free films even with higher thickness.

Abstract
Previous experimental and simulation studies of superparamagnetic colloids in a strong external field have systematically shown a nonequilibrium aggregation process in which chains of particles steadily grow in the direction of the applied external field with the average length increasing as a power law over time. Here we show, by employing Langevin dynamics simulations, the existence of a different behavior under the effects of an external magnetic field: after a transient period of chain formation, the system attains an equilibrium state. Furthermore, a thermodynamic self-assembly theory supports the simulation results and it also predicts that the average chain length in the equilibrium state depends only on a dimensionless parameter combining the volume fraction of colloids ϕ 0
and the magnetic coupling parameter Γ. The conditions under which this new behavior can be observed are discussed here.

Abstract: LAMMPS is a widely popular classical Molecular Dynamics package. It was designed for materials modeling but it is well prepared for simulations in Soft Matter. The use packages like LAMMPS has advantages and disadvantages. The main advantage is the optimization of the methods, mainly for parallel computing. The main disadvantage is that, due to the complexity of the code, it ha long learning curve. One purpose of these notes is to shorten that curve for researchers are starting to use LAMMPS to simulate soft active matter. In these notes, we first discuss some Molecular Dynamics methods implemented in LAMMPS. We present an hands-on introduction to first-time users and we finish with an advanced hands-on section, where we implement and test Active Brownian particles simulations.

Abstract The emergence of methyl-ammonium lead halide (MAPbX3) perovskites motivates the identification of unique properties giving rise to exceptional bulk transport properties, and identifying future materials with similar properties. Here, we propose that this “defect tolerance” emerges from fundamental electronic-structure properties, including the orbital character of the conduction and valence band extrema, the chargecarrier effective masses, and the static dielectric constant. We use MaterialsProject.org searches and detailed electronic-structure calculations to demonstrate these properties in other materials than MAPbX3. This framework of materials discovery may be applied more broadly, to accelerate discovery of new semiconductors based on emerging understanding of recent successes.

Introduction Many semiconductors have been studied over the last century for their possible use in photovoltaics (PVs), light-emitting diodes (LEDs), computing devices, sensors, and detectors. Of these, only a select few have achieved sufficient optoelectronic performance to transition into industrial manufacturing, and their identification and development have been slow and mostly empirical. Recently, high-throughput computation and a deeper understanding of the physics-based requirements for high performance have created the potential for an accelerated identification of functional materials with manufacturing potential. For example, materials screening criteria have been proposed to better focus the search for novel candidate PV materials; they include the optical band-gap energy[ 1 , 2 ] and abruptness of absorption onset,[ 3 , 4 ] in addition to boundary conditions of elemental abundance,[ 5 ] and manufacturing cost.[ 6 , 7 ] However, many materials have met these criteria and yet have not achieved industrially relevant conversion efficiencies (in excess of 10–15%) due to low minority-carrier lifetimes or diffusion lengths, e.g., in the case of Cu 2 ZnSn(S,Se) 4 ,[ 8 ] SnS,[ 9 ] and others.[ 10 ] Meanwhile, PV devices have emerged based on methyl-ammonium lead iodide (MAPbI 3 ) and closely related halides (herein referred to as MAPb X 3 ). MAPbI 3
is a semiconductor, which has demonstrated exceptional minority-carrier lifetimes of 280 ns (in the mixed iodide-chloride composition)[ 11 ] and diffusion lengths up to 175 µm,[ 12 ] comparable with the best single-crystal semiconductors. This, in addition to meeting the criteria above, has resulted in a dramatic realization of PV conversion efficiencies up to 20.1%[ 13 , 14 ] in 2015, from <4% in 2009.[ 15 ] This paper examines whether the dramatic success of MAPb X 3
in PVs can be used as a basis to expand design criteria to identify new potential high-performance optoelectronic materials. One of the most compelling questions engendered by MAPb X 3
as an optoelectronic material is the degree to which it is unique, and whether its success can lead to the identification of materials with improved stability and lower toxicity, yet similar high performance. Clearly, as in previous design criteria the high optical absorption coefficient is important, but also essential are the long carrier diffusion lengths observed in MAPb X 3 , enabled by high minority-carrier lifetime ( τ ) and mobility ( µ ).[ 11 , 16 , 17 ] The importance of
τ
and
µ
for device performance has been established[ 18 ] for the most highly performing PV materials, including silicon,[ 19 ] cadmium telluride,[ 20 , 21 ] copper indium gallium diselenide,[ 22 ] and gallium arsenide.[ 23 ] Oddly, these more direct transport parameters,
τ
and
µ , are not traditionally considered essential screening criteria for novel candidate PV materials. This may be partially a consequence of the difficulty in measuring and/or calculating these parameters. The direct measurement of minority carrier
τ
and
µ
requires ultrafast electronic or optical sensors to capture transients,[ 24 – 27 ] or strong steady-state signals,[ 28 , 29 ] and must be performed with PV-device-relevant illumination conditions, electrical fields, and transport directions. Calculating
τ
and
µ
from first-principles is even more challenging, given the lack of well-established and high-throughput methods to directly calculate electron-phonon interactions and/or trap capture cross-sections. Although it is possible to obtain some information about carrier mobility from effective masses, and maximum radiative lifetime from the band structure, these are known to be insufficient and can be misleading when point and structural defects limit these transport properties.[ 18 ] In this paper, we use established recombination models to identify the underlying electronic-structure parameters of MAPb X 3
that are likely to underpin the high experimentally observed
τ
and
µ , including: dielectric constant, effective mass, band bonding character, and band dispersion (i.e., band extrema relative to vacancy levels). We illustrate how these parameters can be computationally accessible using established variants of density functional theory (DFT). Using the basic properties of MAPb X 3
to define a set of search criteria, we discuss the potential to identify other novel materials with “defect-tolerant” transport properties, starting with the database at MaterialsProject.org.[ 30 ] This may yield materials with similar performance, but enhanced stability and lower toxicity.
Redefining search criteria for defect-tolerant semiconductors This section discusses the emerging explanations for high performance in MAPbI 3
and closely related materials, focusing on the unique aspects that make their performance exceptional: specifically their long non-radiative minority-carrier lifetime, even in the presence of defects. A “defect tolerant” material is expected to either (a) form relatively few intrinsic or structural defects under high-throughput, low-temperature processing conditions, and/or more importantly (b) the extrinsic, intrinsic, or structural defects that do form have a very minimal effect on
µ
and
τ . We discuss models of how a material may achieve this defect tolerance, and suggest by example that the underlying electronic-structure properties may not be unique to MAPb X 3 , but rather be shared in a broader class of compounds.
Explanations for high performance in methylammonium lead iodide and related materials Many authors have proposed explanations for the success of MAPb X 3
as a PV material. These include its large absorption coefficient, long electron and hole diffusion lengths, low exciton-binding energies, low effective masses and high mobilities, and the presence of only shallow defects in the band gap.[ 11 , 16 , 17 , 31 , 32 ] The existence of only shallow defects, and the disperse valence band, have both been tied to the presence of filled Pb 6s orbitals, deriving from the partial oxidation of Pb relative to its Pb 4+
oxidation state. This orbital character has been identified by several authors, and explains both the shallow binding energy of defects and the atypical dependence of band gap on strain or temperature in MAPbI 3 .[ 33 – 35 ] This model for explaining the defect-tolerance and shallow defects has direct analogy to those developed earlier for CuInSe 2 [ 36 ] and Cu 3 N,[ 37 ] where instead the Cu +
cation contributes 3 d
Cu antibonding states to the valence band. In addition, device-level observations support the claims that MAPbI 3
has excellent transport properties, including long carrier diffusion lengths significantly exceeding 1 µm,[ 11 ] and recently, up to 175 µm in single crystals.[ 12 , 38 ] Low non-radiative minority-carrier recombination rates are also supported by measurements of high photoluminescence quantum yield,[ 39 ] long carrier lifetimes,[ 10 ] and the high open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) demonstrated by many devices. These properties are made more exceptional by the way in which MAPbI 3
is processed: low-temperature solution processing results in equal or better performance to vacuum synthesis, which runs contrary to the higher purity, higher temperature, and more equipment-intensive fabrication strategies used to obtain high performance in conventional crystalline semiconductor materials. We substantiate these earlier reports by applying DFT to MAPbI3. In the model pioneered by Zhang,[ 36 ] as well as Lany and Zakutayev,[ 37 ] defect tolerance emerges from having bonding orbitals at the conduction band minimum (CBM), and antibonding orbitals at the valence band maximum (VBM). This band structure is markedly different than that in most semiconductors, where the valence band is composed predominantly of bonding states, whereas the conduction band is composed of wavefunctions with dominant antibonding character. The defect tolerance that emerges from such an electronic structure is easily described using atomic vacancies as examples. Namely, if predominantly antibonding orbitals occur at the VBM and bonding at the CBM, the dangling (broken) bonds that are formed upon creating the vacancy (of any kind) will likely appear as resonances inside the bands, leaving the band gap free of deep states that could act as carrier traps. As shown in Fig.
1
for the valence band of MAPbI3, this is a consequence of the position of valence atomic orbitals relative to the bonding and antibonding bands formed due to interactions. Analogous arguments are also valid for other types of intrinsic defects, such as interstitials and/or antisites, as well as for structural defects such as grain boundaries, which consist of many strained and dangling bonds. Extrinsic impurities could, however, still introduce deep traps inside the band gap depending on the position of their atomic orbitals relative to the energy bands of the host material.

p -orbital contributions. The DOS is computed using DFT, including the effects of SO interactions, with the band gap adjusted to the value reported in Ref.
42
(1.85 eV computed using the many body GW method with SO included). The MA +
cation does not introduce states at the band edge. Full size image These situations, in particular the antibonding character of the VBM, can frequently be found in metal-non-metal systems with partially oxidized cations such as binary group-III halides or group-IV chalcogenides in 1:1 stoichiometry (e.g., TlBr and SnTe). Owing to the partial oxidation of Pb, the MAPbI3 compound also exhibits similar electronic-structure features.[ 41 ] As shown in Fig.
1 , there are three types of interactions that contribute to the valence band in MAPbI 3 . The first results from the overlap of Pb(6 p )–I(5 p ) atomic orbitals leading to the creation of the deeper portion of the valence band, which is predominantly of I(5 p ) character, and the bottom part of the conduction band, which is composed mostly of Pb(6 p ) atomic orbitals. This interaction is responsible for chemical bonding as it implies charge transfer from the Pb(6 p ) to the I(5 p ) orbitals. In addition, Pb(6s)–I(5 p ) interaction leads to the creation of two bands: a deeper valence band (bonding), and the antibonding maximum of the valence band. Finally, only one of the I(5 p ) orbitals is oriented along the Pb–I bond, which is a favorable direction to interact with Pb(6 s ) and Pb(6 p ). The other two, oriented orthogonally, can only interact with the 5 p
orbitals from other iodine atoms forming the middle of the valence band as shown in Fig.
1 . As a result of these interactions, the electronic band gap is formed between the antibonding top of the valence band originating from the Pb(6 s )–I(5 p ) interactions and the antibonding CBM resulting from the Pb(6 p )–I(5 p ) interactions. Bonding-type defect-tolerance arguments can therefore only be applied to the defects that would tend to create valence band-derived states such as cation (Pb or MA) vacancies. On the other hand, if anion (iodine) vacancies form, the resulting dangling bonds will appear as resonances inside the conduction band only if the bandwidth and the dispersion of the conduction band are such that the CBM falls well below the energy of the Pb(6 p)
atomic orbitals. In the case of Pb, contrary to Sn and Ge compounds for example, this condition is more likely due to relativistic[ 43 ] SO interaction effects that increase the width of the Pb(6 p ) conduction band by ~2 eV based on our calculations. Thus, the fact that vacancy-type defects in MAPbI 3
are resonant in the bands is attributed to: (a) the presence of antibonding orbitals within the valence band that push the VBM energy up, and (b) relativistic effects which push the CBM energy down. In summary, an emerging conclusion from both experimental measurements and first-principles calculations is that MAPb X 3
benefits from an inherently defect-tolerant electronic structure.
Modeling electronic transport in the presence of defects To provide physical context for the claims above, and to translate them into electronic-structure design criteria, we focus on transport models in defective materials: in particular, models for defect-assisted
µ
and
τ . These are semiconductor models (distinct from the Langevin recombination model, which is inappropriate for MAPbI 3 ).[ 40 ] Defect-limited, monomolecular, or trap-assisted non-radiative recombination,
U SRH , is modeled by Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination statistics:
$${U_{{\text{SRH}}}} = \frac{{np - n_i^2}}{{{\tau _{0,{\text{h}}}}\left( {n + {n_1}} \right) + {\tau _{0,{\text{e}}}}\left( {p + {p_1}} \right)}},$$
((1))
where
n, p,
and
n i
are the electron, hole, and intrinsic carrier concentrations, respectively.[ 44 ] The low-injection electron and hole lifetimes
τ 0,e
and
τ 0,h , which we seek to maximize, are:
$${\tau _{0,{\text{h}}}} = \frac{1}{{{N_t}{\sigma _{{\text{t,h}}}}{v_{{\text{th,h}}}}}}{\text{and}}{\tau _{0,{\text{e}}}} = \frac{1}{{{N_t}{\sigma _{{\text{t,e}}}}{v_{{\text{th,e}}}}}},$$
((2))
where
N t
is the trap density,
σ t
is the capture cross-section for electrons or holes, and
v th
is the drift velocity of carriers. At low injection conditions, the hole and electron lifetimes tend toward
τ h
=
τ 0,h
and
τ e
=
τ 0,e , respectively; at high-injection conditions, both hole and electron lifetimes tend toward
τ h
=
τ e
=
τ 0,h
+
τ 0,e . The terms
n 1
and
p 1
reflect the occupancy of trap states, where
E t
is the energy level of the trap state and
E i
the Fermi level in the intrinsic material (near mid-gap):
((3))
From this model, three conditions are necessary to limit SRH (trap-assisted) recombination: defect energy levels far from mid-gap, as these exponentially impact lifetime; low trap density
N t ; and low capture cross-sections
σ . Operating in high-injection conditions is helpful (where photogenerated carrier concentrations greatly exceed background doping densities), especially when strongly injection-dependent defects limit lifetime.
E t
and
N t
may be calculated from first-principles; however, this calculation is computationally expensive, so we seek more fundamental electronic properties accessible by high-throughput screening. The first, and most important property is the relative static permittivity, or dielectric constant
ε r . A higher dielectric constant indicates a greater ability to screen charge, and may arise from electronic or ionic contributions, as well as the methylammonium molecular dipoles in the lattice.[ 45 ] This screening means that the capture cross-section of a charged defect will be influenced by the dielectric constant. Assuming a Coulombic model for capture cross-section, a capture event will occur when the electrostatic potential energy from a charged defect exceeds the thermal energy, kT, which occurs at a specific radius,[ 46 ] therefore:
((4))
where
q
is the elementary charge, and
ε 0
is the vacuum permittivity. MAPbI 3
has demonstrated a large static dielectric constant of 60–70 or higher,[ 16 , 47 , 48 ] due to electronic, ionic, and molecular dipole contributions from the organic cation.[ 49 ] This charge screening is very beneficial, given the inverse square dependence of carrier capture cross-section, and in turn recombination rate, on the dielectric constant. In addition, for a simple “hydrogenic” defect under Effective Mass Theory, the energy level of the defect sits deeper in the gap for lower dielectric constants,[ 44 ] i.e. the binding energy of a donor relative to the conduction band,
E C
is:
((5))
where
m * e
is the effective mass of an electron, and
ℏ
is the reduced Planck constant. Similar charge screening behavior has been used to explain the low binding energy of excitons in MAPbI 3 [ 45 ] and shallow effective mass-like states.[ 50 ] More important, however, is the energy level of non-effective-mass like traps formed by vacancies and structural defects. As discussed above, band structures containing antibonding orbitals in the VBM, bonding in the CBM, and/or high dispersion within a band can lead to shallower defects, as defect energy levels are resonant with the conduction or valence bands. A second model proposed to explain the lack of deep trap states is that MAPbI3 is more ionic than other semiconductors,[ 50 ] resulting in shallower or fewer defect states associated with dangling bonds. Analogous arguments have been made to explain defect tolerance in GaN[ 51 ] and (Cd, Zn)Te.[ 52 ] The second critical transport property is the minority-carrier mobility, which is influenced by the effective masses of free carriers and by the frequency of scattering events. The lower the effective mass, or the more disperse the band edges, the higher the mobility. However, in typical polycrystalline materials at room temperature, the mobility will not reach this intrinsic limit due to several forms of scattering. One way in which the mobility will be limited is by charged defect scattering, either at ionized impurities or grain boundaries. Again, a high dielectric constant reduces the spatial extent and the potential barrier of a charged defect, lowering its propensity to scatter free carriers. For ionized impurities, the mobility
µ H,ii
is given by:
((6))
where
r H,ii
is the Hall coefficient for ionized impurity scattering,
Z
is the charge on the ionized site,
N t
is the trap density,
b
= 24 m*kT/ℏ 2 β S 2 , and
β S
is the inverse screening length.[ 53 ] Thus, to reduce the impact of ionized impurities on mobility, it is again ideal to have a high dielectric constant, low effective mass, and low trap density. Grain boundary scattering is also reduced for larger dielectric constants, and when the defect levels associated with grain boundaries become shallower.[ 54 ] Alternatively, the mobility limit may come from phonon scattering. The phonon-limited mobility is generally smaller in softer materials, given their higher concentration of phonons at a given temperature—the bulk modulus,
B , and phonon-limited mobility
µ ph
are correlated,[ 55 ] where
A 0
is a constant:
$${\mu _{{\text{ph}}}} = {A_0}B{\left( {m*} \right)^{ - 2.5}} \cdot $$
((7))
MAPbI 3
is a relatively soft material, with a bulk modulus predicted to be 22.2 GPa for the cubic phase.[ 56 ] This may explain why its mobility, measured about 10 cm
2 /V/s,[ 40 ] is not large relative to III–V and group IV semiconductors. Claims of “high” mobilities may be relative to dyes and organic absorber materials from which much of the perovskite PV work derived. Thus, similar to the absorption coefficient of MAPbI 3 , its mobility is necessary but insufficient to explain its high performance. To compare these proposed performance criteria for PV, the ratio of the diffusion length to the absorption length in an absorber material must be maximized to produce high photocurrent in a PV device, as in this non-dimensional figure of merit[ 57 ]:
$$v = \frac{{{k_B}T}}{q}\mu \tau {\alpha ^2},$$
((8))
while historical PV screening approaches have focused on maximizing
α ; here instead we focus on
τ . Given that the mobility and absorption coefficient are good, but not exceptional for MAPbI 3 , we suggest that it is the minority-carrier lifetime of MAPbI 3
that is most strongly responsible for its exceptional performance. Finally, it is worth mentioning that beyond point and structural defects, a disordered crystal structure can limit the conversion efficiency by introducing defect states near the band edges (Urbach tail). MAPbI 3
demonstrates a very small Urbach tail energy.[ 58 ] This may be due to its low melting temperature, such that the material develops more crystalline order at lower processing temperatures (high homologous temperatures).[ 16 ] To review, we summarize the priorities for high-performance PV absorbers in Fig.
2 . While prior work has focused on screening for optical properties, we focus specifically on electronic-structure properties that have a direct impact on transport, highlighted in bold.
Toward ideal electronic structure: the importance of partially oxidized, heavy post-transition metals Materials that contain a lone 6 s 2
or 5 s 2
pair of electrons on the cation have the potential to share the high dielectric constant, low effective masses, and VB antibonding character that lead to defect tolerant transport properties. As a broad class, these are compounds formed from partially oxidized post-transition metals including In, Sn, Sb, Tl, Pb, and Bi. In the case of MAPbI 3 , the partially oxidized Pb atom in its Pb 2+
charge state lends these beneficial properties—a large, polarizable cation leads to high Born effective charge and therefore large dielectric constants,[ 35 ] as well as a conduction band with greater bandwidth due to SO coupling, while filled 6 s
orbitals lead to a disperse valence band (low effective mass)[ 32 ] and antibonding orbital character in the VBM. Other partially oxidized post-transition metals including In + , Sn 2+ , Sb 3+ , Tl + , Pb 2+ , and Bi 3+
share these properties, and are present in a wide variety of materials. This
N- 2 oxidation state is more commonly observed for compounds of Tl, Pb, and Bi, due to relativistic effects leading to tighter binding of the remaining s electrons; however, lighter cations may also be stabilized in these oxidation states. Given their many beneficial properties, these cations appear increasingly in many optoelectronic applications: PbS and lead halide perovskites in PV; TlBr, PbI 2 , and BiI 3
in x-ray detectors and scintillators[ 59 ]; Sn 2+ -based TCOs[ 60 ]; and Pb- and Bi-based ferroelectrics, photoferroelectrics,[ 61 ] piezoelectrics,[ 62 ] and thermoelectrics. For the thallous halides, analogous 6 s 2 6 p 0
orbital explanations for low effective mass, antibonding VBM states, and a high dielectric constant were offered several years before similar work on MAPb X 3 .[ 63 , 64 , 65 ]
Figure 2. Screening criteria for high-performance PV materials, focusing on the properties that enable excellent bulk transport in the presence of defects. Optical properties and scalability concerns have previously been emphasized in screening, and are important but insufficient to achieve high performance. Full size image To identify promising materials in this class, we developed a script to search through all materials in the Materials Project. org (MP) database.[ 30 ] This is implemented using the Materials Project API and the pymatgen library, to access information on calculated crystal and electronic structure for all compounds in the database.[ 66 ] This search examines approximately 27,000 non-metallic inorganic compounds with full band structures calculated, and extracts information on crystallographic point group, stability, band structure, and in particular the fractional DOS by element and orbital. To screen for the properties described above, we calculate the
s -orbital fraction in the top 1 eV of the valence band DOS. This metric is a rough filter, and may mistakenly identify materials with band-inversion, as well as many metal hydrides and Au −
compounds, wherein the anion species contributes a filled
s
orbital at the valence band edge. In Fig.
3 , we compare a random subset of the materials identified in this broad search, and note the stark differences in VBM DOS character for different classes of materials. Conventional tetrahedrally coordinated III–V and II–VI compounds all demonstrate almost exclusive
p -orbital character at the VBM, as do the majority of compounds. Other defect tolerant Cu-chalcogenide semiconductors, such as CuInSe 2 , demonstrate a large
d -orbital character in the valence band due to full 3 d
cation orbitals. Meanwhile, the inorganic I–II–VII 3
family of perovskites sit along the bottom axis, reflecting their larger
s -orbital fraction in the valence band DOS. However, they are not unique in this property. In addition, we plot a random fraction (30%) of the Materials Project Sn-cation compounds on these axes as well, separating them by those with Sn 2+
and Sn 4+
cations. The Sn 2+
cation-compounds cluster in the same region as the halide perovskites, whereas Sn 4+
compounds resemble the vast majority of semiconductors with anion
p -orbital or transition metal cation
d -orbital character.
Figure 3. Ternary plots demonstrating the partial DOS of the VBM by orbital type, for a wide range of randomly selected materials. Overlayed on the left are the conventional zincblende and wurtzite semiconductors for PV, as well as Cu-chalcogenides showing higher
d -orbital fraction, and the halide perovskites with higher s-orbital fraction. On the right, Sn-containing compounds demonstrate a distinct split along two axes, with Sn 2+
compounds demonstrating similar character to the halide perovskites. Full size image Finding good candidate semiconductors with the
N -2 oxidation state is not straightforward, for several reasons. Firstly, the use of more electronegative anions (oxygen, fluorine, and chlorine) tends to fully oxidize these cations. By pairing them with sulfur, selenium, iodine, and bromine, or by including a less electronegative cation such as an alkali metal, it is possible to stabilize the lower oxidation state. Secondly, the lone s orbitals are often stereochemically active,[ 67 ] leading to lower symmetry point groups, and a higher likelihood of indirect gaps. For example, for Sn compounds from the Materials Project database, only 29% of those with Sn 2+
are found to have direct band gaps, whereas for Sn 4+ , 47% have direct band gaps. Anisotropic crystal structures may also lead to anisotropic transport properties and surface potentials,[ 68 ] which may adversely influence device performance. Lastly, these cations may convert to the higher oxidation states inadvertantly, when exposed to oxidizers such as oxygen or moisture. In CsSnI 3
and MASnI 3 , this Sn 4+
formation results in metallic behavior with very high carrier concentrations.[ 34 , 69 ] Lastly, we note that all of the materials identified in the MaterialsProject.org search are inorganic, and we recognize the important role that the asymmetric, molecular cations such as methylammonium play in achieving large dielectric constants in these materials. Converting the inorganic materials identified herein into hybrid organic-inorganic analogues could lead to improved defect tolerance, but the presence of MA or other molecular cations is not the most important criteria in achieving defect tolerance. Thus, replacement of Pb in MAPb X 3
with transition metal cations may not yield high-performing semiconductors.
Outlook: identifying other promising materials classes with excellent transport properties By filtering the materials data drawn from the Materials Project database, we focus on several interesting classes that may share the beneficial properties identified above. Our search first identifies the class of halide perovskites (CsPbI 3 , CsSnI 3 , RbPbBr 3 , etc.); to our knowledge prior optoelectronic screening efforts have not identified these as promising materials. In the list below, we exclude Pb 2+
and Tl + -containing compounds based on toxicity; there are many promising optoelectronic materials containing these atoms. Unfortunately, the beneficial properties of Pb 2+
and Tl +
are also connected to their toxicity, as they mimic the large ionic sizes of Ca 2+
and K +
in the human body. This excludes the binary lead and thallium halides and chalcogenides such as TlBr, as well as a number of ternary chalcohalides or chalcogenides such as TlBiS 2 . In addition, this search is limited to materials existing in the MaterialsProject.org database. New materials may be discovered or designed using the present framework, for example the recently discovered Bi 2 FeCrO 6
perovskite,[ 70 ] which achieves an unusually small band gap for a complex oxide ferroelectric, and promising PV performance. We compute the electronic structure from first-principles for several classes of materials, which were identified through the broad computational survey. These classes are described below:
(i)
Binary chalcogenides and halides
(BiI 3 , Bi 2 S 3 , SbI 3 , Sb 2 S 3 , SnI 2 , InI, etc.): There are many binary iodides, sulfides, and selenides formed with
ns 2 np 0
cations, several of which have band gaps in the range of interest for PV. Those with band gaps 1.7 eV and greater, such as BiI 3 , PbI 2 , and TlBr, have been demonstrated successfully in x-ray detecting and scintillator applications, with high
µτ
products.[ 59 , 63 , 71 ]
(ii)
Binary halides, sulfides, and selenides stabilized in cubic structures such as NaCl and CsCl:
Given the anisotropic transport properties that result from stereochemically active lone pairs in materials such as SnS, more promising materials may result by stabilizing them in higher symmetry phases. Recently, it was demonstrated that SnS and SnSe may be stabilized in the NaCl structure by alloying with CaS.[ 72 ] Similarly, TlI may be stabilized in the CsCl phase by alloying,[ 73 ] suggesting a possible similar route with InI.
(iii)
Chalcohalides
(BiOI, BiSI, BiSeI, SbSI, SbSeI, BiSBr, BiSeBr, etc.): The
ns 2 np 0
chalcohalides (V–VI–VII compounds) range over visible to UV band gaps,[ 74 ] and many demonstrate ferroelectric behavior at lower temperatures as well. Both Sb- and Bi-containing varieties have demonstrated photoconductive or PV effects.[ 75 – 78 ] SbSI and SbSeI have recently been identified for their potential applications as photoferroelectrics[ 79 ]; however, those in the paraelectric phase may still demonstrate large Born effective charge, and a large static dielectric constant.
(iv)
Ternary alkali chalcogenides
(LiBiS 2 , NaBiS 2 , KBiS 2 , RbBiS 2 , CsBiS 2 , etc.): Similar to the formation of I–III–VI 2
analogues of the zincblende II–VI compounds, one may form I–III–VI 2
rocksalt compounds based on the PbS and PbSe rocksalt phases.[ 80 – 82 ] These include Pb-free chalcogenides with an octahedrally coordinated Bi 3+
cation.
(v)
Ternary halides:
(In 3 SnI 5 , InAlI 4 , etc.): In +
and Tl +
may be stabilized by several non-coordinating molecular anions such as
\({\text{AlI}}_4^ - \) .[ 83 ] In addition, multiple cations can be stabilized in their lower oxidation states together, as in Sn 2+
and In +
in the case of In 3 SnI 5 .
(vi)
In + –II–VII 3
ternary halides
(CdInBr 3 , CaInBr 3 , etc.): In +
is also stabilized in a number of In – II – VII 3
compounds, which appear to have band gaps outside of the range for PV, but which may exhibit similar defect tolerant properties.
(vii)
Bismides and antimonides
(e.g., KSnSb): Sn 2+
and other partially oxidized cations are stabilized in several bismides and antimonides, most of which have band gaps too small for PV absorbers under 1-Sun illumination.
(viii)
Octahedrally coordinated metal halides
(Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 , Rb 3 Bi 2 I 9 ,K 3 Bi 2 I 9 ,Cs 3 Sb 2 I 9 , etc.): Bi 3+
and Sb 3+
form
\({\text{II}}{{\text{I}}_{\text{2}}}{{\text{X}}_{\text{9}}}^{3 - }\)
anions that consist of edge or face-sharing octahedra, bonding with alkali metals to form a variety of materials with different band gaps, crystal structures, and ferroelectric phase transitions.[ 84 – 87 ]
(ix)
Cs-containing compounds substituting 1+ molecular cations
[e.g., (MA) 3 Bi 2 I 9 , (FA) 3 Bi 2 I 9 , etc.]: Lastly, we can identify a variety of Cs-containing materials, which could be converted to hybrid materials by the substitution of the Cs with an alkylammonium or other molecular cation.[ 86 , 88 ] A simple example is the family containing (MA) 3 Bi 2 I 9
or (FA) 3 Bi 2 I 9
(with formamidinium as the organic cation). A number of other molecular cations may be substituted as well based on size, analogous to the substitution explored in MAPb X 3 ,[ 89 , 90 ] to tune the band gap or to form lower-dimensional structures.
As an illustration, we perform first-principles (DFT) calculations on some of the above-listed materials to probe whether these materials have low effective masses and high static dielectric constants, in addition to containing cation antibonding orbitals in the VB, and compare these results with those of MAPbI 3 . These DFT results are summarized in Table
I , including the band gap ( E G ), relative valence band ( E V ) and conduction band energies ( E C ), effective masses
m*
for holes and electrons from the DOS, the band degeneracy at the CBM and VBM extrema, and the ionic dielectric constant. DFT calculations are performed with SO coupling; we compare the band extrema energies with and without SO coupling to demonstrate the relativistic effects. DFT is known to consistently under-predict the band gap, thus, we do not present the electronic component of the dielectric constant. Instead, we present only the ionic dielectric constant computed from density functional perturbation theory. In addition, the band-gap values, both the minimum and the direct gap, are given to provide an indication of the type of optical transition at the lowest energy gap. The larger the difference between the minimal and the direct gap, the weaker the absorption onset is. More information on these calculations is supplied in the Methods section.
Table I. DFT-computed band structures, band dispersion (with SO coupling), effective masses, and ionic dielectric constants for several compounds of interest, as compared with the (MA)B X 3
family of perovskites. Full size image It is important to draw attention to several conclusions from this table. Firstly, many of these materials are relatively ionic, like MAPbI 3 , making it difficult to achieve smaller band gaps (note again that the band gaps presented here are underestimated, and many will be >2 eV in reality). Secondly, anisotropic crystal structures with stereochemically active lone pairs often lead to higher hole effective masses. Thirdly, most of the materials presented here demonstrate large ionic dielectric constants, independent of whether they have a polar space group. It is clear that MAPbI 3
offers an unusual mix of ionicity, high dielectric constant, low effective masses, and a lower band gap for PV; few semiconductors can claim excellent performance across all categories. Another conclusion consistent with prior observations is that compounds formed with 6 p
block cations show a significantly larger contribution of SO coupling in the conduction band, versus those formed from the 5 p
block. While Pb and Tl compounds are not included here, the Bi compounds show a much stronger SO contribution than do the In, Sn, and Sb compounds. This may suggest that the Bi-containing compounds are most suitable for achieving similarly shallow anion vacancy levels as in MAPbI 3 . To illustrate the similarities in band structure to MAPbI 3 , the band orbital diagrams and DOS are presented in Fig.
4
for a handful of materials. As anticipated, they all demonstrate the same cation antibonding
s -orbital contributions at the VBM.
Figure 4. DOS plotted for three materials identified here, including (a) InI, (b) SbSI, and (c) BiSI. The partial DOS are separated into their atomic orbital contributions, with anions on the positive
y -axis and cations on the negative axis. The cation s states separate into bonding
σ
(lower energy) and antibonding
σ * (higher energy) orbitals. Full size image Summary In this perspective piece, we have proposed new search criteria for the discovery of semiconductors for optoelectronic applications. This strategy builds upon the recent success of methylammonium lead iodide as a PV material, which achieves excellent device efficiencies in the presence of defects. While calculating defect-limited minority-carrier mobility and lifetime is challenging, we propose that more fundamental electronic-structure properties are indicative of defect tolerance, demonstrated by models for defect-assisted recombination and scattering. These models are consistent with emerging experimental and theoretical observations of MAPb X 3 , as well as other semiconductor systems, which share defect tolerance. Most importantly, MAPb X 3
is not unique in these properties, and we identify a broad class ofsemiconductors containing partially oxidized cations, as well as several specific instances that may share these properties. To demonstrate this, we search through the MaterialsProject.org database of materials, and establish a set of criteria for future identification of promising defect-tolerant semiconductors. Many fields would benefit from the development of semiconductors of a wide range of band gaps that can achieve low non-radiative recombination rates and good transport—green LEDs, thin-film PV, and photodetectors, to name a few. We hope that this framework will provide a new direction for materials discovery in these fields, and in doing so, bring understudied semiconductors to the fore to help build the next generation of energy-generating, light-emitting, sensing, and computing devices.
Methods All DFT and related calculations are performed using VASP computer code.[ 91 ] The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional form[ 92 ] of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) to density functional theory has been employed in this work, together with the projector-augmented wave formalism.[ 93 ] Full atomic, volume, and cell shape relaxations are performed at the GGA–PBE level using the numerical setup, including
k -point sampling and various cutoffs, following Ref.
94 . For the various electronic-structure properties reported in Table
I , such as band gaps, SO interaction contributions to band edges, DOS effective masses and band degeneracies; the denser
k -point grid is used. For compatibility between different calculations, the number of
k -points per atom was kept fixed at
N atoms * N kpts
= 6000, which leads to the convergence of relevant electronic-structure properties.[ 55 ] The SO interaction is included at the level of first-order perturbation to the DFT results. Ionic dielectric tensors are computed from the interatomic force constants obtained using the density functional perturbation theory.[ 95 ] The dielectric constants reported in Table
I
are computed as one-third of the trace [Tr( ε )/3] of the dielectric tensors.

A novel signal processing scheme for the analysis of laser light scattered by small particles allows the measurement of very small collective particle motion in the presence of large diffusive motion. The technique uses a symmetric real fringe Doppler system with frequency shift. Amplitude and phase of the high pass filtered Doppler intensity signal are measured simultaneously and processed into an amplitude weighted phase structure function. An analysis of this function yields diffusion coefficient and, in a sinusoidal electric field, electrophoretic mobility. If present, a constant velocity motion, e.g., due to thermal convection, is simultaneously determined. The technique overcomes a principal limit of conventional light scattering techniques and allows the use of small fields or the measurement of small zeta potentials. Experimental results on latex systems and macroemulsions demonstrate possible improvements.

Abstract
This article reviews progress in the field of food colloids with particular emphasis on advances in novel functional ingredients and nanoscale structuring. Specific aspects of ingredient development described here are the stabilization of bubbles and foams by the protein hydrophobin, the emulsifying characteristics of Maillard-type protein–polysaccharide conjugates, the structural and functional properties of protein fibrils, and the Pickering stabilization of dispersed droplets by food-grade nanoparticles and microparticles. Building on advances in the nanoscience of biological materials, the application of structural design principles to the fabrication of edible colloids is leading to progress in the fabrication of functional dispersed systems—multilayer interfaces, multiple emulsions, and gel-like emulsions. The associated physicochemical insight is contributing to our mechanistic understanding of oral processing and textural perception of food systems and to the development of colloid-based strategies to control delivery of nutrients during food digestion within the human gastrointestinal tract.

Abstract Of the many materials and methodologies aimed at producing low-cost, efficient photovoltaic cells, inorganic–organic lead halide perovskite materials 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17
appear particularly promising for next-generation solar devices owing to their high power conversion efficiency. The highest efficiencies reported for perovskite solar cells so far have been obtained mainly with methylammonium lead halide materials 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 . Here we combine the promising—owing to its comparatively narrow bandgap—but relatively unstable formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI 3 ) with methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr 3 ) as the light-harvesting unit in a bilayer solar-cell architecture 13 . We investigated phase stability, morphology of the perovskite layer, hysteresis in current–voltage characteristics, and overall performance as a function of chemical composition. Our results show that incorporation of MAPbBr 3
into FAPbI 3
stabilizes the perovskite phase of FAPbI 3
and improves the power conversion efficiency of the solar cell to more than 18 per cent under a standard illumination of 100 milliwatts per square centimetre. These findings further emphasize the versatility and performance potential of inorganic–organic lead halide perovskite materials for photovoltaic applications.

Main An inorganic–organic lead halide perovskite is any material that crystallizes into an AMX 3
(where A is an organic ammonium cation, M is Pb or Sn, and X is a halide anion) structure. The size of cation A is critical for the formation of a close-packed perovskite structure; in particular, cation A must fit into the space composed of four adjacent corner-sharing MX 6
octahedra. Of the various inorganic–organic lead halide perovskite materials, methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI 3 ), with a bandgap of about 1.5–1.6 eV and a light absorption spectrum up to a wavelength of 800 nm, has been extensively used as a light harvester in solar cells. Several methods, including a one-step spin-coating method 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , a two-step sequential method 4 , and vapour deposition in a high-vacuum chamber 5 , have been used to prepare MAPbI 3
materials. Additionally, different device architectures such as planar 5 , 10
and mesostructured cells 1 , 7
have also been proposed. The highest power conversion efficiency 8 , 9 , 11
(PCE) so far, of 16% to 17%, was achieved for solution-processed MAPbI 3,
although 19.3% in a planar device architecture was recently obtained from a reverse-bias current–voltage ( I – V ) curve 12 . We note that a PCE measured 13 , 14 , 15
via a reverse-bias scan with the solar cells exhibiting a large-hysteresis
I – V
curve can be highly overestimated. We have already showed that chemical modification of the X site anions (for example, substitution of I with Br) of MAPbI 3
can tune the bandgaps to range between 1.5 eV and 2.3 eV by incorporating MAPbBr 3
(2.3 eV bandgap); this resulted in colour variation and PCE modulation 6 . In contrast, HC(NH 2 ) 2 PbI 3 , which contains formamidinium (FA) cations instead of methylammonium (MA) cations at the ‘A’ site of the AMX 3
perovskite structure, has a bandgap of 1.48 eV, with an absorption edge of 840 nm (refs
16 ,
17 ,
18 ). We expect that this reduced bandgap may allow absorption of photons over a broader solar spectrum. The structural and opto-electrical differences of MAPbI 3
and FAPbI 3
are likely to originate from the difference in ionic radius of the MA (1.8 Å) and FA ions (1.9–2.2 Å). In fact, the relative ionic radii of A, M and X in the AMX 3
perovskite structure have been widely used as a method of establishing the distortion of the MX 6
octahedron; in particular, a relatively smaller ion radius for X favours the formation of cubic structures 18 . However, the photovoltaic performance of FAPbI 3
has been reported to be lower than that of MAPbI 3
(refs
16 ,
17 ). In addition, the black perovskite-type polymorph (α-phase), which is stable at relatively high temperatures (above 160 °C), was observed to turn into the yellow FAPbI 3
polymorph (δ-phase) in an ambient humid atmosphere 17 . However, considering their suitable bandgap (which is lower than that in MAPbI 3 ), the performance of FAPbI 3
solar cells can be considerably improved by stabilizing the FAPbI 3
phase, improving the crystallinity, and optimizing the cell architecture. In this regard, Pellet
et al. 19
demonstrated an improved PCE using mixed cation lead iodide perovskites by gradually substituting MA with FA cations—which increases the absorption range by shifting it redwards, allowing for a higher current density—but the performance was still dominated by MAPbI 3
rather than FAPbI 3 . We have recently reported a 16.2% certified PCE obtained from the combination of MAPbI 3
and MAPbBr 3
with a bilayer architecture consisting of perovskite-infiltrated mesoporous-TiO 2
electrodes, and an extremely uniform and dense upper perovskite layer obtained by solvent engineering techniques 13 ; the absorption edge was below 770 nm. A strategy for extending the absorption range of solar light is thus to replace MAPbI 3
with FAPbI 3
in the combined composition of MAPbI 3
and MAPbBr 3 . Here we report the overall PCE and structural stability of (FAPbI 3 ) 1 −  x (MAPbBr 3 ) x , with the mole ratio
x
ranging between 0 and 0.3. We investigated the performance of systems containing different amounts of MAPbBr 3
incorporated into FAPbI 3 —that is, (FAPbI 3 ) 1 −  x (MAPbBr 3 ) x —by measuring their current density versus voltage ( J−V ).
Figure 1a
shows the PCEs obtained from the
J−V
curves for different (FAPbI 3 ) 1 −  x (MAPbBr 3 ) x
systems under standard air-mass 1.5 global (AM1.5G) illumination. The PCEs were averaged from the reverse (from the open-circuit voltage
V oc
to the short-circuit current
I sc ) and forward (from
I sc
to
V oc ) sweeps, because perovskite solar cells may experience a dependence of the measured efficiency on the scan direction. However, the hysteresis of the cells fabricated from FAPbI 3
and FAPbI 3
incorporating 15 mol% MAPbBr 3
was not relevant, even after collecting
J−V
curves with the relatively short scanning delay time of 40 ms ( Fig. 1b ). In addition, the small discrepancies related to the scan direction for the FAPbI 3 /MAPbBr 3
systems disappeared at longer delay times (above 100 ms). That the hysteresis observed in FAPbI 3 -based systems is negligible compared to the hysteresis in MAPbI 3
( Fig. 1b
inset) may be related to the balance between electron and hole transport within the perovskite layer. Figure 1: Characterization of materials. a , PCE values for cells using (FAPbI 3 ) 1 −  x (MAPbBr 3 ) x

Full size image As reported, the electron-diffusion length in MAPbI 3
( ∼ 130 nm) is 1.4 times larger than the hole-diffusion length ( ∼ 90 nm) 20 , while FAPbI 3
has a hole-diffusion length ( ∼ 813 nm) that is 4.6 times longer than the electron-diffusion length ( ∼ 177 nm) 16 . In addition, Kanatzidis
et al. 18
showed, by measuring the Seebeck coefficient, that MAPbI 3
and FAPbI 3
display an n-type and a p-type character, respectively. Since the incident light of the FTO/TiO 2 /perovskite/PTAA/Au (where FTO is fluorine-doped tin oxide and PTAA is poly(triarylamine)) cell configuration reaches the perovskite through the FTO side, more carriers are generated on the perovskite near TiO 2
than on the perovskite near PTAA. Therefore, many more holes than electrons should travel a long distance through the perovskite layer to the PTAA layer. This indicates that the balance between electron and hole transport in cells should be considered in compositional engineering for highly efficient perovskite solar cells. Data in
Table 1
show that the solar cell annealed at 100 °C with
x
= 0 exhibits considerably low
J sc ,
V oc
and fill factor (FF) values. In contrast, the overall PCE, including
J sc ,
V oc
and FF, noticeably increased when annealing was performed at 150 °C. The trend of PCE as a function of
x
in the cells fabricated with FAPbI 3 –MAPbBr 3
showed that
J sc
increases from 19.0 mA cm −2
(at
x
= 0.05) to a maximum value of 22 mA cm −2
(at
x
= 0.15); after this point,
J sc
decreases to 20 mA cm −2
(at
x
= 0.30). In this range,
V oc
increases from 1.0 V to 1.12 V. Interestingly, the FF showed exactly the same
J sc
behaviour with a maximum value of 73% at
x
= 0.15. Table 1 Photovoltaic parameters from (FAPbI 3 ) 1 −  x (MAPbBr 3 ) x Full size table The ultraviolet–visible absorption spectra displayed in
Fig. 1c
show a systematic shift of the absorption band edge to shorter wavelengths when the MAPbBr 3
content is increased. The reduction of
J sc
observed with
x
larger than 0.15 is directly related to the blue-shift of absorption onset, which in turn is responsible for the reduced light-harvesting efficiency. As expected, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum shown in
Fig. 1d
is blue-shifted when
x
is increased, resulting in the reduction of
J sc . However, a relatively lower
J sc , below
x
= 0.15, indicates that the charge-collection efficiency is also low, because
J sc
is proportional to the product of the charge-collection efficiency and the light-harvesting efficiency. The fact that the FF has a trend similar to that of
J sc
supports this, as confirmed by the considerably high series resistance shown below
x
= 0.15 (with annealing at 100 °C). The increase of
V oc
over the entire range studied in this work may be attributed to the widening of the bandgap, which occurs when
x
increases. Most importantly, the PCE of the solar cells fabricated in this study exhibits a maximum value of 17.3% at
x
= 0.15, owing to the simultaneous enhancement of
J sc
and FF, while
V oc
continues to increase (because the PCE is determined from the products of
J sc ,
V oc
and FF). To further elucidate possible reasons for such low values of
J sc
and
FF
below
x
= 0.15, we examined the phase stability of FAPbI 3 . It is known that FAPbI 3
is characterized by a reversible phase transition between two polymorphs, that is, a black perovskite with trigonal symmetry (space group
P 3 m 1) and a yellow non-perovskite with hexagonal symmetry ( P 6 3 mc ) 17 , 18 . The latter contains linear chains of [PbI 6 ] octahedrons with face-sharing, while the former consists of a three-dimensional network of corner-sharing octahedrons. Figure 2a
shows the results of the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis of a yellow FAPbI 3
powder heated at 300 °C. An endothermic peak around 160 °C was found with the DSC analysis, which appears without any weight loss up to 250 °C in the thermogravimetric analysis. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of the yellow powder measured
in situ
( Extended Data Fig. 1 ) suggest that the endothermic peak can be assigned to the phase transition from yellow non-perovskite to black perovskite, in agreement with previous studies 16 , 21 . This indicates that the yellow non-perovskite phase for the pure FAPbI 3
material is likely to be thermodynamically stable. This phase transition was also found to be reversible in air, that is, the prepared yellow non-perovskite phase changed to the black perovskite phase when annealing was performed at 170 °C; the black powder turned yellow again after being stored in air for 10 days ( Extended Data Fig. 2 ). Figure 2: Characterization of materials. a , DSC and thermogravimetric curves of the as-prepared yellow FAPbI 3

Full size image This unintentional phase transition in FAPbI 3
solar cells may reduce the photovoltaic performance, because the yellow phase is characterized by a large optical bandgap ( Fig. 1c ) and an inferior charge-transporting ability due to the linear chain-like [PbI 6 ] octahedron structure. Notably, AMX 3
(where A is Rb, Cs, MA or FA, M is Pb or Sn, and X is Cl, Br or I) metal trihalide materials exist as either two polymorphs (perovskite and non-perovskite) or only one of the two, depending on the atomic size of the components 22 . For example, in contrast to CsSnI 3 , which has two polymorphs, MASnI 3 , with larger MA +
cations, shows only a perovskite phase and no phase transition near room temperature ( ∼ 25 °C). RbSnI 3 , with smaller Rb +
cations, shows only a non-perovskite phase 22 , 23 , 24 . Therefore, the atomic combination of the A and X sites may lead to the stabilization of the FAPbI 3
perovskite structure. Figure 2b
shows the XRD spectra of the prepared FAPbI 3 , (FAPbI 3 ) 1 −  x (MAPbI 3 ) x , (FAPbI 3 ) 1 −  x (FAPbBr 3 ) x , and (FAPbI 3 ) 1 −  x (MAPbBr 3 ) x
films (with
x
= 0.15) on mesoporous-TiO 2 /blocking-TiO 2 /FTO glass substrates, after annealing at 100 °C for 10 min; these were prepared using the solvent-engineering process with precursor solutions of the desired compositions as previously reported 13 . The XRD spectrum of the pure FAPbI 3
thin film shows the typical diffraction pattern of a hexagonal non-perovskite polymorph of FAPbI 3
( P 6 3 mc ) 18 ; this can be detected from DSC ( Fig. 2a ), because the temperature of the annealing (100 °C) is much lower than the temperature (160 °C) at which the phase transition occurs. However, when FA +
cations in FAPbI 3
are substituted by 15 mol% of MA +
cations, a strong (111) diffraction peak at 13.9° for the trigonal perovskite phase ( P 3 m 1) appears in spite of the annealing at 100 °C. The same diffraction peaks are also observed in systems containing Br −
ions (15 mol%), although the secondary phase coexists in the film. Surprisingly, a simultaneous introduction of 15 mol% of both MA +
cations and Br −
anions in FAPbI 3
to obtain (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15
leads to a synergetic effect that stabilizes the perovskite phase. Interestingly, this is sufficient to form a FAPbI 3
perovskite phase even after incorporating 5 mol% of MAPbBr 3
( Extended Data Fig. 3 ), although the single MA +
or Br −
can only partially form a perovskite phase. We also found that a highly crystalline perovskite layer is formed with values of
x
larger than 0.15, according to the full width of half maximum (FWHM) of the (−111) diffraction peak ( Fig. 2c ). Therefore, we surmise that the enhancement of the phase stability and crystallinity results in an improvement of PCE in the
x
range of 0 to 0.15. The perovskite phase stabilization caused by the introduction of MAPbBr 3
to FAPbI 3
was also confirmed by an analysis carried out on the synthesized powders, which were prepared at room temperature by precipitation from solutions of FAPbI 3 , (FAPbI 3 ) 1 −  x (MAPbI 3 ) x , (FAPbI 3 ) 1 −  x (FAPbBr 3 ) x , and (FAPbI 3 ) 1 −  x (MAPbBr 3 ) x
with
x
= 0.15. Photographs of the as-prepared powders shown in
Extended Data Fig. 4
indicate that a black powder like as-prepared MAPbI 3
is obtained only for (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15 . In addition, the XRD spectra of the powders revealed that (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15 , in contrast to FAPbI 3 , shows a pure perovskite phase ( Extended Data Fig. 5 ), with no endothermic DSC peaks ( Fig. 2a ). This finding confirms that the co-substitution of MA to FA and Br to I can efficiently stabilize the perovskite phase. However, further investigation is required to determine the energetics of the perovskite and non-perovskite formation and to establish the composition of the stable form in perovskite halide materials. We recently successfully fabricated a complete bilayer on a mesoporous-TiO 2
using the solvent-engineering technology; our findings confirmed that surface coverage and morphology of perovskite materials is critical 13 . For this reason, here we analysed the surfaces deposited with different
x
values for MAPbBr 3 /FAPbI 3
using the solvent-engineering process.
Figure 2d
shows the surface scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of (FAPbI 3 ) 1 −  x (MAPbBr 3 ) x , with
x
= 0, 0.05 and 0.15, on a 200-nm-thick mesoporous-TiO 2 /blocking-TiO 2 /FTO annealed for 10 min at 150 °C ( x
= 0) and 100 °C, respectively. Our results showed that the surface of FAPbI 3
exhibits an irregular morphology with bumpy roughness. Incorporating MAPbBr 3
into FAPbI 3
(with
x
= 0.15) considerably smoothed the surface; however, systems characterized by
x
= 0.05 still presented large voids between crystal boundaries. The rough surface of FAPbI 3
may be due to the transition from non-perovskite to perovskite phases and to the high temperature required for the formation of the perovskite phase. Indeed, manipulating the composition of FAPbI 3
by adding MAPbBr 3
led to the stabilization of the perovskite phase with a uniform and dense morphology as well as well-developed crystallites, which are responsible for the highly improved cell performance. On the basis of these results, we repeated the fabrication procedure, fixing
x
to a value of 0.15 to enhance further the performance of the FAPbI 3 -MAPbBr 3
system with an architecture as follows: FTO/blocking-TiO 2
(70 nm)/mesoporous-TiO 2 :perovskite composite layer (200 nm)/perovskite upper layer (300 nm)/PTAA (50 nm)/Au (100 nm). Of the devices obtained,

curves measured via reverse and forward bias sweep for one of the best-performing solar cells. The
J sc ,
V oc
and FF values averaged from the
J–V
curves of this device are 22.5 mA cm −2 , 1,105 mV and 73.2%, respectively; these correspond to a PCE of 18.4% under standard AM1.5G conditions. The PCE value is in agreement with that obtained from the stabilized power output near the maximum power point, reflecting the device performance in the working condition more closely ( Extended Data Fig. 6 ).

Full size image In the case of the cell using thinner mesoporous-TiO 2
layer (80 nm), as shown in
Extended Data Fig. 7 , although an unprecedented PCE of 20.3% was measured via reverse bias scan, the PCE of around 17.3% obtained from an average
J–V
curve and steady-state current measurement is far lower than that from the best cell using a 200-nm-thick mesoporous-TiO 2
layer, owing to the low PCE of 15.5% with forward bias scan. This result is similar to those of ref.
12
and implies that substantial PCE values should be obtained from
J–V
curves averaged with reverse and forward bias sweep.
Figure 3b
shows the EQE spectrum for one of the best-performing solar cells. A very broad EQE plateau of over 80% between 400 nm and 750 nm was observed. The
J sc
value integrated from EQE was found to be in good agreement with that measured by
J–V . The highly performing devices exhibiting PCEs of 18.0% with very small hysteresis was certified by the standardized method in the photovoltaic calibration laboratory, confirming a PCE of 17.9% under AM1.5G full sun ( Extended Data Fig. 8 ). To the best of our knowledge, such a PCE value is the highest ever reported for a perovskite-based solar cell, excluding the value overestimated by reverse bias scan. We have described the compositional engineering of (FAPbI 3 ) 1 −  x (MAPbBr 3 ) x
for efficient perovskite solar cells. (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15
has many advantages over other systems such MAPbI 3 , FAPbI 3 , and MAPb(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3 . This strategy may lead to more efficient and cost-effective inorganic–organic hybrid perovskite solar cells. Methods Materials Unless stated otherwise, all materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Junsei Organics and used as received. PTAA was purchased from EM Index. Synthesis of the TiO 2
paste The TiO 2
nanoparticles used in the paste were prepared by hydrothermal treatment at 250 °C for 12 h from aqueous solutions of the peroxotitanium complex, as described elsewhere 25 , 26 . The peroxotitanium complex solutions were synthesized via a reaction between hydrogen peroxide and the TiO(OH) 2
wet cake. The wet cake was obtained by the dropwise addition of a NH 4 OH solution into 0.33M TiOCl 2
aqueous solution obtained by the hydrolysis of TiCl 4 . The resulting cake was purified by repeated washing with deionized water until no Cl −
ions were detected. Then, 200 ml of 35 wt% hydrogen peroxide was added into 300 ml of a 2 wt% TiO(OH) 2 -dispersed aqueous solution such that the H 2 O 2 /Ti 4+
ratio was
∼ 40; the solution was constantly stirred in an ice bath. Once the addition of H 2 O 2
was completed, the colour of the precipitate changed from white to turbid yellowish, and finally light orange- or reddish-coloured transparent solutions were formed within 1 h. The TiO 2 -nanoparticle (average diameter 50 nm, anatase) slurry obtained by the hydrothermal treatment was stirred for 1 h, while several drops of concentrated nitric acid were added to obtain a colloidal dispersion solution. Then the TiO 2
nanoparticles were collected by the centrifugal method. The TiO 2
wet cake was re-dispersed and centrifuged in absolute ethanol by ultrasonic irradiation. The process with absolute ethanol was repeated for three cycles. The collected TiO 2
nanoparticles were dispersed in 100 ml of absolute ethanol, 4.5 g (per 1 g of TiO 2 ) of a 10 wt% ethanolic solution of ethyl cellulose (Fluka, 46070), and 4.4 g (per 1 g of TiO 2 ) of terpineol. After the addition of each component, the mix was stirred for 10 min and homogenized by ultrasonic irradiation. The paste was finally produced by a three-roller-mill grinder (EXAKT) after concentrating the mixture solution in a rotary evaporator. Synthesis of the inorganic–organic mixed perovskite CH 3 NH 3 I and NH 2 CH = NH 2 I were first synthesized by reacting 30 ml hydroiodic acid (57% in water, Aldrich), 27.86 ml CH 3 NH 2
(40% in methanol, Junsei Chemical), and 15 g formamidine acetate (Aldrich) in a 250 ml round-bottomed flask at 0 °C for 2 h with stirring. The precipitates were recovered by evaporating the solutions at 50 °C for 1 h. The products were dissolved in ethanol, recrystallized using diethyl ether, and finally dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h. Similarly, CH 3 NH 3 Br and NH 2 CH = NH 2 Br were prepared using hydrobromic acid (48 wt% in water, Aldrich) according to a reported procedure 27 . The desired solutions of FAPbI 3 , (FAPbI 3 ) 1 −  x (MAPbI 3 ) x , (FAPbI 3 ) 1 −  x (FAPbBr 3 ) x , and (FAPbI 3 ) 1 −  x (MAPbBr 3 ) x
(with
x
= 0–0.30) were prepared by dissolution of the CH 3 NH 3 I, CH 3 NH 3 Br, NH 2 CH = NH 2 I, and NH 2 CH = NH 2 Br powders with PbI 2
(Aldrich) and PbBr 2
(Aldrich) in the γ-butyrolactone:DMSO mixed solvent (7:3, volume ratio) at 60 °C for 10 min. Solar cell fabrication A dense blocking layer of TiO 2
(60 nm, blocking-TiO 2 ) was deposited onto an F-doped SnO 2
(FTO, Pilkington, TEC8) substrate by spray pyrolysis using a 20 mM titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution (Aldrich) at 450 °C; this was done to prevent a direct contact between FTO and the hole-conducting layer. A 200-nm-thick mesoporous-TiO 2
was spin-coated onto the blocking-TiO 2 /FTO substrate using TiO 2
pastes diluted in 2-methoxyethanol (1 g in 5 ml) and calcinated at 500 °C for 1 h in air to remove the organic components. The inorganic–organic lead halide perovskite solutions were then coated onto the mesoporous-TiO 2 /blocking-TiO 2 /FTO substrate by two consecutive spin-coating steps, at 1,000 rpm and 5,000 rpm for 40 s and 20 s, respectively. During the second spin-coating step, 1 ml toluene was poured onto the substrate, according to the procedure reported in ref.
13 . To obtain a uniform and flat intermediate-phase film, toluene should be quickly cast in one-shot mode on a rapidly rotating (at 5,000 rpm) substrate to wash out the surplus of DMSO molecules that did not participate in the formation of the PbI 2 –NH 2 CH = NH 2 I–DMSO complex. The substrate was then dried on a hot plate at 100 °C or 150 °C for 10 min. A solution of PTAA (EM Index, [Mn] = 17,500 g mol −1 )/toluene (10 mg ml −1 ) with an additive of 7.5 µl Li-bis(trifluoromethanesulphonyl) imide/acetonitrile (170 mg ml −1 ) and 4 µl 4- tert -butylpyridine was spin-coated on the perovskite layer/mesoporous-TiO 2 /blocking-TiO 2 /FTO substrate at 3,000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, an Au counter electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation; the active area of this electrode was fixed at 0.16 cm 2 . The different inorganic–organic lead halide triiodide powders were prepared by precipitation using toluene at room temperature from the desired compositional solutions obtained by dissolving CH 3 NH 3 I, CH 3 NH 3 Br, NH 2 CH = NH 2 I and NH 2 CH = NH 2 Br powders with PbI 2
and PbBr 2
in γ-butyrolactone. Characterization The XRD spectra of the prepared films were measured using a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer; the
in situ
XRD experiment of the as-prepared FAPbI 3
yellow powder was performed using a Rigaku Ultima IV with an X-ray tube (Cu Kα, wavelength
λ
= 1.5406 Å). Ultraviolet–visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV 2550 spectrophotometer in the 300–800 nm wavelength range at room temperature. The morphology of the films was observed using a field-emission SEM (MIRA3 LMU, Tescan). Thermogravimetric and DSC analyses of the as-prepared powders were performed with a heating rate of 2 °C min −1
from room temperature up to 300 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere using TA Instruments SDT 2960 and DSC 2910, respectively. EQE was measured by a power source (Newport 300W Xenon lamp, 66920) with a monochromator (Newport Cornerstone 260) and a multimeter (Keithley2001). The
J–V
curves were measured using a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Class A, 91195A) with a source meter (Keithley 2420) at 100 mA cm −2
AM1.5G illumination and a calibrated Si-reference cell certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, USA. The
J–V
curves were measured by reverse scan (forward bias (1.2 V) → short circuit (0 V)) or forward scan (short circuit (0 V) → forward bias (1.2 V)). The step voltage was fixed at 10 mV and the delay time, which is a delay set at each voltage step before measuring each current, was modulated. The
J–V
curves for all devices were measured by masking the active area with a metal mask (area of 0.096 cm 2 ).

Editorial Summary High-performance perovskites solar cells Inorganic–organic lead halide perovskites are currently attracting considerable interest for solar-cell applications. Most of the best performing perovskite solar cells to date have made use of methylammonium-based perovskites; formamidinium-based perovskites have also shown promise, but are not as stable. Now Nam Joong Jeon and colleagues show that the formamidinium-based perovskites can be stabilized by the addition of some methylammonium-based perovskite, and that solar cells incorporating the resulting compositionally tuned materials can reach new heights of efficiency. show all

Abstract
Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite photovoltaics (PSCs) have attracted significant attention during the past decade. Despite the stellar rise of laboratory-scale PSC devices, which have reached a certified efficiency over 25% to date, there is still a large efficiency gap when transiting from small-area devices to large-area solar modules. Efficiency losses would inevitably arise from the great challenges of homogeneous coating of large-area high quality perovskite films. To address this problem, we provide an in-depth understanding of the perovskite nucleation and crystal growth kinetics, including the LaMer and Ostwald ripening models, which advises us that fast nucleation and slow crystallization are essential factors in forming high-quality perovskite films. Based on these cognitions, a variety of thin film engineering approaches will be introduced, including the anti-solvent, gas-assisted and solvent annealing treatments, Lewis acid–base adduct incorporation,
etc. , which are able to regulate the nucleation and crystallization steps. Upscaling the photovoltaic devices is the following step. We summarize the currently developed scalable deposition technologies, including spray coating, slot-die coating, doctor blading, inkjet printing and vapour-assisted deposition. These are more appealing approaches for scalable fabrication of perovskite films than the spin coating method, in terms of lower material/solution waste, more homogeneous thin film coating over a large area, and better morphological control of the film. The working principles of these techniques will be provided, which direct us that the physical properties of the precursor solutions and surface characteristics/temperature of the substrate are both dominating factors influencing the film morphology. Optimization of the perovskite crystallization and film formation process will be subsequently summarized from these aspects. Additionally, we also highlight the significance of perovskite stability, as it is the last puzzle to realize the practical applications of PSCs. Recent efforts towards improving the stability of PSC devices to environmental factors are discussed in this part. In general, this review, comprising the mechanistic analysis of perovskite film formation, thin film engineering, scalable deposition technologies and device stability, provides a comprehensive overview of the current challenges and opportunities in the field of PSCs, aiming to promote the future development of cost-effective up-scale fabrication of highly efficient and ultra-stable PSCs for practical applications.

Abstract The fields of photovoltaics, photodetection and light emission have seen tremendous activity in recent years with the advent of hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites. Yet, there have been far fewer reports of perovskite-based field-effect transistors. The lateral and interfacial transport requirements of transistors make them particularly vulnerable to surface contamination and defects rife in polycrystalline films and bulk single crystals. Here, we demonstrate a spatially-confined inverse temperature crystallization strategy which synthesizes micrometre-thin single crystals of methylammonium lead halide perovskites MAPbX 3
(X = Cl, Br, I) with sub-nanometer surface roughness and very low surface contamination. These benefit the integration of MAPbX 3
crystals into ambipolar transistors and yield record, room-temperature field-effect mobility up to 4.7 and 1.5 cm 2  V −1  s −1
in
p
and
n
channel devices respectively, with 10 4
to 10 5
on-off ratio and low turn-on voltages. This work paves the way for integrating hybrid perovskite crystals into printed, flexible and transparent electronics.

Introduction Hybrid organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites (CH 3 NH 3 PbX 3 , X = Cl, Br, and I) have emerged as a remarkable solution-processable semiconductor over the past few years, fast becoming a serious contender for efficient thin film photovoltaics (PVs) 1 , 2 , 3 . Good carrier transport properties along the vertical direction have made even polycrystalline films with small grain size sufficiently good to achieve power conversion efficiency of more than 20%. The situation is markedly different in electronic devices, such as field-effect transistors (FETs), where fast and unimpeded lateral charge transport should occur through the confines of the semiconductor–dielectric interface over much longer distances 4 , 5 . Consequently, the presence of grain boundaries, interfacial contamination, and other defects can severely hinder field-effect carrier mobility and FET device operation 6 , 7 . Grain boundaries in polycrystalline hybrid perovskites have been linked to significant lateral tunnel junctions, a problem further exacerbated by the tendency of lead halide and perovskite hydrates to form at surfaces, interfaces, and even in grain boundaries 8 , 9 , 10 . It is perhaps for these reasons that very few reports have emerged on working perovskite FETs, particularly at room temperature 7 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 . Duan and co-workers 11 , 12 , 13
made CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
FETs with different size microplates and demonstrated field-effect mobility at low temperatures. Sirringhaus and co-workers 14
optimized thin film processing and achieved room temperature electron field-effect mobility of 0.5 cm 2  V −1  s −1 . More recently, Nazeeruddin and co-workers 15
demonstrated high quality mixed cation perovskite films yielding balanced ambipolar FETs with carrier mobility ca. 2 cm 2  V −1  s −1
at room temperature. Single crystals (SCs) are normally far less defective than polycrystalline films in most materials and may be best suited to overcome these challenges, as they eliminate grain boundary defects altogether. Bulk SCs (BSCs) of hybrid perovskites have already been reported to exhibit higher carrier mobility, longer carrier diffusion length, and lower trap density than polycrystalline films 20 , 21 . To date, however, bulk perovskite SCs continue to underperform in optoelectronic devices, such as solar cells 21 , 22 , 23
and photodetectors 22 , 24 , as compared to their polycrystalline thin film (PTF) counterparts 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , and there are no reports to date of SC perovskite use in FETs. This can be attributed to extensive surface contamination due to incomplete precursor conversion and hydration of the perovskite crystal faces, which change the near-surface composition, structure, morphology, and electronic properties 9 , 22 , 25 , 29 . Such imperfections are expected to severely impact electrical contacts, interfacial charge transport in the channel and to hurt FET device operation 11 , 28 . Cleaning and peeling procedures have been attempted and are commonly used prior to investigation of optoelectronic properties of BSCs, but these are not practical and have not been shown to work for FET devices 21 , 22 . Integration of crystals into planar device architectures is also challenging unless crystallization methods, such as anti-solvent vapor-assisted crystallization 20 , low temperature solution 21 , 22 , or inverse temperature crystallization approaches 30 , 31
are adapted to the device integration needs as well. Here, we show a spatially confined inverse temperature crystallization method that successfully synthesizes controlled micrometer-thin single crystals (TSCs) of different hybrid perovskites (MAPbX 3 , X = Cl, Br, and I) with tunable lateral size ranging from micrometers to millimeters, as needed. As confinement templates the crystal’s top and bottom facets, the SC achieves conformal growth on flat and pre-patterned surfaces with excellent adhesion. TSCs with sub-nanometer surface roughness and remarkably low surface contamination are demonstrated despite fabrication in ambient air. Ambipolar MAPbX 3 -based TSC-FETs with bottom-gate bottom-contact and bottom-gate top-contact architectures are demonstrated and achieve record field-effect hole (electron) mobilities as high as 3.8 (0.32), 3.6 (0.26), and 4.7 (1.51)cm 2  V −1 s −1
for X = Cl, Br, and I, respectively. The devices also exhibited on/off ratio up to 10 5
and low turn-on and threshold voltages. Substrates pre-patterned with Au contacts were also shown to yield working FETs, demonstrating conformal crystal growth on patterned surfaces. The successful demonstration of high-performance TSC-FETs is attributed to the superior semiconductor–dielectric interface in the channel achieved owing to the significantly reduced roughness, defects, and contamination of the confined crystal facet as compared to polycrystalline films and free-grown BSCs. This approach paves the way for electronic devices and circuits based on hybrid perovskite semiconductors and also addresses key integration issues for perovskite single crystals into devices requiring lateral charge transport. Results Fabrication of hybrid perovskite TSCs Saidaminov et al. 30
first reported that MAPbX 3
(X = Cl, Br, and I) perovskites exhibit an inverse temperature solubility behavior in certain solvents, which has been utilized to grow macroscopic perovskite single crystals 32 , 33 . Liu et al. 31
developed the technique and fabricated 150-µm-thick single-crystalline perovskite wafers. Chen and co-workers. 23
demonstrated that thickness can be tuned by changing the distance between two substrates. Our method takes a further step in the direction of TSC fabrication by confining the starting solution between two substrates—one or both of which can be pre-patterned with electrodes—separated by a fixed spacer intended to control the thickness, contact quality, and promote lateral growth. In Fig.  1a , we show a schematic representation of the thickness-confined crystallization strategy. In this example, a 2.5-µm-thick polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film was used as spacer between two glass slides and molten at 270 °C to achieve good adhesion. The perovskite ink was injected between the two slides and was drawn through capillary forces. Crystallization occurred under heating (see Methods for details). A key difference between this approach and the inverse temperature crystallization in a beaker, vial, or even a substrate 30
is that our method provides additional control knobs of importance to device integration, in terms of the confinement spacing, geometry, choice of confining materials—including surface engineered or pre-patterned surfaces, and the starting volume of ink, which can be replenished as needed. The confinement spacer and the volume of ink determine the thickness and lateral size of the TSCs, respectively, while the confining material also dictates the roughness of the crystal’s top and bottom surfaces. Fluorescence microscopy images and related optical micrographs of typical MAPbX 3
(X = Cl, Br, and I) crystals grown using this method (Fig.  1b ) show lateral dimensions reaching the millimeter scale in a single run, while the thickness (approximately 2.45 μm) is fixed by the spacer (Fig.  1c , Supplementary Figure  1a–c ). Fig. 1 Hybrid perovskite TSC fabrication.

These advantages include formation of a single domain macroscopic crystal that is free of domain and grain boundaries and which can be defined as a single crystal and behave as such. We confirm this by inspecting the crystalline structure, optical properties, and surface morphology of the TSCs. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements on MAPbX 3
TSCs (Fig.  1d ) reveal that the MAPbCl 3
and MAPbBr 3
TSCs have a cubic lattice, while the MAPbI 3
TSC has a tetragonal lattice. XRD data comparing PTFs, TSCs, and BSCs of MAPbBr 3
(Fig.  2a ) clearly show that the structure of the TSC is identical to BSC samples, as expected. We further analyzed the crystallinity of the MAPbBr 3
TSC using XRD rocking curve (XRC) analysis of the (001) diffraction (Supplementary Figure  2 ). The full-width at half-maximum was found to be 0.063°. The narrow width of the (001) peak is quantitatively comparable to the other reported values for MAPbBr 3
SCs and validates the high-quality single-crystalline nature of our materials 31 , 34 , 35 . Ultraviolet–Visible (UV–Vis) absorbance and photoluminescence spectra of the TSCs are also very similar to those of BSCs (Supplementary Figure  1d ,
1e ). Fig. 2 Microstructure and surface properties of TSCs.

XPS spectra of the surface of MAPbI 3
TSC and BSC Full size image Importantly, the surface of the TSCs look featureless in the confined regions under scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Supplementary Figure  3 ) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Fig.  2b, c ). By contrast, PTFs exhibit a large number of crystals, domains, and pinholes, while the surface of the BSC shows evidence of significant corrugation and roughness left over from the crystallization process. The surface of the TSC inspected after removal of the confining superstrate is extremely smooth, as well as free of any apparent grain and domain boundaries, pointing to their single-crystalline nature. AFM images comparing MAPbBr 3
thin film (Fig.  2b ) and TSC (Fig.  2c ) surfaces reveal a starkly different root mean-squared (RMS) surface roughness of 16.5 nm vs. 0.21 nm, respectively. In fact, we found the RMS roughness of all three halide TSCs to be one to two orders of magnitude lower than polycrystalline films and bulk crystals (Fig.  2d ) 21 , 29 , 30 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 . This is largely owing to the confined growth method which forces the crystal to undergo conformal growth against the very smooth confining substrate and superstrate. Further examination of the surface of TSCs revealed the appearance of atomically flat terraces near the unconfined edges of the crystals, as seen by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements performed in ultra-high vacuum (UHV conditions). STM micrographs obtained in UHV (Fig.  2e ) reveal atomically flat terraces with an apparent step height consistent with perovskite lattice planes (crystal lattices of 5.68 and 5.92 Å for cubic MAPbCl 3
and MAPbBr 3 , respectively). The appearance of terracing with monolayer steps on one or more of the facets of a macroscopic crystal is usually ascribed to its homoepitaxial growth behavior, either via layer-by-layer or step flow processes. This offers further evidence in favor of the single-crystalline nature of TSCs. We did not observe this layered structure on the edges of MAPbI 3
TSCs, which may be due to the tetragonal crystal structure of MAPbI 3
TSCs 26 , whereas the other crystals are cubic. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements performed on MAPbI 3
TSCs and BSCs show clear peaks at 533.7 and 532.4 eV in the latter case, which are assigned to the –COOH 40
and –COH groups 41 , respectively (Fig.  2f ). These peaks are absent from the surface of TSCs, which is remarkable for these materials considering that the confined samples were grown in ambient air. Separation from the superstrate was performed inside a nitrogen glove box prior to the XPS measurement and transfer to UHV by using a vacuum suitcase to avoid additional contamination by exposure of the free surface to air. The XPS analysis indicates that the buried interfaces of TSCs grown via confinement are mostly free of the surface chemical contaminations commonly seen on free-grown crystals and polycrystalline films. The formation of high-quality, planar, smooth, grain boundary-free, and contamination-free crystal facets is particularly useful in the context of device integration. Many device architectures require at least one high-quality facet to make contacts, while others may require two parallel facets. Bottom-gate bottom-contact (BGBC) and top-gate top-contact FETs require one high-quality facet for both channel and contacts, whereas bottom-gate top-contact (BGTC) and top-gate bottom-contact FETs use opposing facets for channel and contacts. Below, we will demonstrate that the confinement method can yield working BGBC and BGTC FET devices requiring one or two facets of the TSCs, respectively. Single crystal FETs We have fabricated BGTC FETs with channel length ( L ) ranging from 10 to 150 µm (schematic shown in Fig.  3a ). The channel width ( W ) depended upon the lateral size of the TSCs and was measured individually for each TSC that was successfully coated with a pair of Au electrodes (see Supplementary Figure  4 ). A highly
n -doped Si wafer with a 240 nm SiO 2
layer (capacitance
C i  = 15nFcm −2 ) was employed as the substrate, gate electrode, and gate dielectric. We found Au (work function around 4.7 eV) 42
to be a suitable contact for both hole and electron injection as the valance band maximum/conduction band minimum of MAPbX 3
(X = I, Br, and Cl) are 3.8/5.3 eV for I, 3.38/5.68 eV for Br, and 2.94/5.82 eV for Cl 43 . Additional BGTC devices were also fabricated with lower work function contacts, including Ag and Al. However, the devices either did not operate or were damaged shortly after initiating measurement. We suspect chemical damage to the contacts which showed evidence of discoloration shortly after fabrication. Figure  3b–d

plots. The plots appear linear over a wide range of
V GS
for both
p - and
n -type transports, which demonstrates ambipolar behavior and high-quality devices. It is worth mentioning that the transport property is sensitive to device fabrication conditions, such as the temperature, electrode materials, doping state, and dielectric interface 7 , 13 , 16 . In this case, the use of Au electrodes, along with room temperature measurement of device characteristics, may explain the ambipolar behavior consistent with previous reports 13 , 16 . The field-effect mobility ( μ ) can be extracted in the saturation regime using the saturated

relationship:
\(I_{{\mathrm{DS}}} = \frac{W}{{2L}}C_{\mathrm{i}}\mu \left( {V_{{\mathrm{GS}}} - V_{{\mathrm{TH}}}} \right)^2\) . Accordingly, the maximum saturation hole (electron) mobilities for the devices based on MAPbCl 3 , MAPbBr 3 , and MAPbI 3
TSCs are found to be 2.6 (2.2), 3.1 (1.8), and 2.9 (1.1)cm 2 V −1 s −1 , respectively (see Table  1
and Supplementary Table  1 ). Supplementary Figure  5
shows the saturation field-effect mobility vs. gate voltage for the devices based on MAPbCl 3 , MAPbBr 3 , and MAPbI 3
TSCs employing the top-contact configuration. The saturation mobility values stay flat after the tune-on gate voltage and agree with the values reported in Table  1
and Supplementary Table  1 . The statistical distribution of hole mobility for 60 devices is shown in Fig.  3e , with the average hole (electron) mobility of 1.8 (1.3), 1.9 (1.1), and 1.5 (0.7)cm 2 V −1 s −1 , respectively, for MAPbCl 3 , MAPbBr 3 , and MAPbI 3
TSC devices. The mobility was found to increase as the channel increased from 10 to 150μm (Supplementary Figure  6a ), which may be attributed to reduced relative influence of contact resistance as the channel resistance increases (Supplementary Figure  6b–d ), while field-dependent transport does not appear to be dominant. The current on/off ratios are found to be on the order of 2.4 × 10 4 , 4.8 × 10 3 , and 6.7 × 10 3 , while the threshold voltages ( V TH ) are found to be 4.4, −4.9, and −13.2 V, for X = Cl, Br, and I, respectively. The positive shift of
V TH
may be attributed to unintentional oxygen-induced hole doping from the bottom dielectric surface 6 , which was UV-O 3
treated to increase hydroxyl groups and enhance the adhesion between TSCs and the SiO 2 /Si substrate 11 . Fig. 3 Characteristics of top-contact TSC-FETs.

is calculated to be 80, 150, and 195kΩcm for MAPbCl 3 , MAPbBr 3 , and MAPbI 3 , respectively, (Supplementary Figure  6b–d ) highlighting generally good contacts. Supplementary Figure  7
summarizes the results of the transconductance (d I DS /d V GS ) 45 , 46
for our perovskite SC transistors. The best-performing
p -type device based on MAPbCl 3
SCs possesses a peak transconductance of 0.2 mS (at
V GS  = −35 V). We believe that the high carrier mobility of perovskite SCs is the key reason behind the high currents and transconductances observed. The contact resistance and transconductance provide fine perspectives to analyze the device, which are valuable for investigating the carrier injection at the interface between the perovskite and electrodes and for designing better device with large amplification 45 , 46 . It is important to note that BGTC devices were successful despite charges having to travel through a micrometer-thick semiconductor layer to reach the channel, much more than is typical for thin film transistors 5 , 44 . To exclude the effect of crystal thickness, we have fabricated BGBC devices by growing SCs directly onto the substrate pre-patterned with Au electrodes (Fig.  4a ). One key benefit of this approach is the excellent adhesion of the SCs to the pre-patterned electrodes, as indicated by delamination of the metal contacts from the substrate when attempting to peel off the crystals (Supplementary Figure  8 ). The bottom surface morphologies of perovskite TSCs were imaged by AFM as shown in Supplementary Figure  9 , which reveals a small RMS roughness (0.70, 1.23, and 1.02 nm for MAPbCl 3 , MAPbBr 3 , and MAPbI 3 , respectively) indicative of a smooth interface for the buried interface as well. However, we also noted instances where Au contacts seemed discolored and other instances where Au contacts delaminated, suggesting undesirable chemical interactions with the perovskite ink or etching of the Cr adhesion layer 47 . Perhaps as a result of this, BGBC devices tended to fail when the applied gate voltage was >± 10 V, thus limiting the field-effect mobility analysis window to the linear regime. Not surprisingly, BGBC devices fabricated with substrates pre-patterned with Ag and Al electrodes failed to operate, as the contacts did not survive the harsh environment and conditions of crystal growth. In some cases, Au electrodes were also seen to delaminate and float to the surface of the solution after just a few hours of inverse temperature crystallization. We ascribe this to etching of the Cr adhesion layer used prior to Au deposition. Fig. 4 Characteristics of bottom-contact TSC-FETs.

Field-effect hole mobility distribution for 20 devices fabricated and tested for each halide perovskite Full size image For MAPbI 3 , generally smaller crystals were typically obtained in the presence of pre-patterned Au electrodes (see Supplementary Figure  10 ), suggesting that the presence of metal influences the crystallization process. The transfer curves of BGBC devices based on MAPbX 3
with X = Cl, Br, and I (Fig.  4b–d ) show asymmetric curves with an ambipolar behavior similar to BGTC devices (see output curves in Supplementary Figure  11 ). We should mention that the
I DS
for the MAPbI 3 -based device is about 10 times higher than that of the Cl- and Br-based devices, which is due to the fact that the channel width ( W ) of each device depended upon the lateral size of the TSCs and was measured individually for each TSC. The figures of merit and the channel size of BGBC devices are summarized in Table  2
( V GS
scanning direction: from  −10 to 10 V;
V DS  =  −2 V). The maximum linear hole (electron) mobilities of 3.8 (0.32), 3.6 (0.26), and 4.7 (1.51)cm 2  V −1 s −1
at room temperature were achieved for X = Cl, Br, and I, respectively (Table  2
and Supplementary Figure  12 ), while the average linear hole (electron) mobilities for the same were 2.1 (0.27), 2.3 (0.19), and 2.9 (1.12)cm 2 V −1 s −1
(Supplementary Table  2 ). The mobility vs.
V GS
for the FETs based on MAPbCl 3 , MAPbBr 3 , and MAPbI 3
TSCs is shown in Supplementary Figure  13 . At a value of
V DS  =  −2 V, the linear charge mobilities are corresponding to the these shown in Table  2
and Supplementary Table  2 . The current on/off ratios are found to be on the order of 10 5
and
V TH
was found to be typically low (±1.6 V). The variations in the mobility are difficult to explain with the current level of understanding of hybrid perovskites and will require significantly more experimental and theoretical insight. The same can be said for differences in the polarity of devices. Both are realistically linked to the choice of contact material, to processing conditions, and to the quality of the channel. The SC–electrode contact resistance plays a role. Mobility is known to be linked to the quality of the SC–dielectric interface in the channel of FET devices. Hence, the presence of and variations in structural and morphological defects, chemical contaminations, and unreacted reagents are expected to influence carrier mobility. Table 2 The figures of merit of BGBC TSC-FET devices based on MAPbX 3
(X = Cl, Br, and I) Full size table The state-of-the-art mobility results highlight the overall success and versatility of the confinement crystallization approach and its ability to successfully integrate hybrid perovskite SCs into FET devices even when pre-patterned electrodes are used. The relatively high field-effect mobility measured in hybrid perovskite SC-FET devices at room temperature can be attributed to excellent planarity, absence of grain and domain boundaries, low surface roughness, and reduced chemical contamination at the buried semiconductor–dielectric interface inside the channel. Mitigation of these imperfections through confined crystallization has helped the FET devices tap more easily into the properties of the bulk semiconductor. We have calculated the interfacial trap state density ( N it ) from the subthreshold swing,
S , in the subthreshold regime (Supplementary Figures  14
and
15 ) using the formulae
S  = d V GS /d(log  I DS ) and
N it  = ( Sq / k B T  ln 10–1)( C i / q ), where
q
is the elementary charge,
k B
is the Boltzmann constant, and
T
is the temperature, as summarized in Tables  1
and
2 . The calculated
N it
values for MAPbX 3
TSCs with X = Cl, Br, and I in BGBC (BGTC) device configurations are 3.3 × 10 12
(5.3 × 10 12 ), 3.0 × 10 12
(4.6 × 10 12 ), and 3.8 × 10 11
(3.7 × 10 12 )eV −1 cm −2 . The MAPbI 3
SC-FET exhibits the lowest
S
of 0.6 and 3.8 Vdec −1 , respectively, in BGBC and BGTC devices, corresponding to the lowest
N it . The low
N it
values point to the formation of a reasonably high-quality semiconductor–dielectric interface. It should be noted here that the
N it
for the I-based devices were ca. 10 times lower than those of the Cl- and Br-based devices, because of differences in lateral size of the SCs defining the channel width ( W ). By comparing with the state-of-art FET researches based on perovskite materials (Supplementary Table  3 ), the field-effect mobility values reported at room temperature for MAPbCl 3 , MAPbBr 3 , and MAPbBr 3
are the highest to date for FETs made, thus far, with polycrystalline films of these materials 7 , 11
and are the first report of single crystal hybrid perovskite FET devices. The hole mobility of MAPbI 3
perovskites is improved by approximately two- to fivevfold compared with the PTF mobility at room temperature 7 , and is a rough order of magnitude higher than that measured at 77 K 11 . It is also worth noting that the hole mobilities reported herein are competitive with many other solution-processed semiconductors used in
p -channel FETs, including organics 48 , metal oxides 49 , pseudo halides 50 , 51 , and quantum dot solids 52 . Hybrid perovskite semiconductors have recently been identified as mixed ionic–electronic conductors owing to the ability of charged defect ions to migrate under an external bias 53 , 54 , 55 . The resulting effect is a hysteresis in current–voltage sweeps. This effect has been broadly reported for solar cells, and more recently in memristors and light-emitting FETs fabricated using hybrid perovskites 56 , 57 , 58 . The hysteresis effects was speculated to be related to screening effects arising from field-induced drift of methylammonium cations 59 . Charge traps and surface dipoles at the untreated dielectric–semiconductor interface may also be attributed to the hysteresis effect 60 . For BGBC devices, the hysteretic behavior and influence of scan rate and direction on FET devices based on MAPbCl 3 , MAPbBr 3 , and MAPbI 3
TSCs was studied by sweeping the voltage in transfer curves in the sequence −10 → 0 → + 10 → 0 → −10 V for BGBC devices at rates ranging from 0.05 to 0.25 V s −1 . The
V GS
forward and reverse scanning directions at a rate of 0.05 V s −1
are shown in Supplementary Figure  16 . We can find that the carrier mobility extracted from the forward scanning gate sweep is higher than that extracted from the reverse scanning gate sweep, especially in the case of MAPbI 3 . The effect was lower in MAPbCl 3
and negligible in MAPbBr 3 . The measured current values are plotted on a logarithmic scale in Supplementary Figure  17 . The transfer curves and the output curves exhibit weak but notable hysteresis effects (Fig.  4 ), which is fortunately not substantial in low sweep rates. Moreover, larger open circuit voltages 10
(the difference of voltage between two current minimum points) and less pronounced hysteresis were detected in conditions of slower sweep rate of the transfer curves. The hysteresis becomes more severe and the saturation current decreased with increasing sweep rate. For instance, significant hysteretic behavior was observed when BGTC devices (Supplementary Figure  18 ) were deliberately subjected to large
V GS
sweeps (±40 V) and fast sweep rate (0.5 V s −1 ). Defect ion migration is more favorable at slower than at faster sweep rates, since they are less mobile than electronic carriers (electrons and holes), making hysteresis more severe and reducing the saturation current in faster sweep conditions. Discussion We have demonstrated high-performance FET devices based on MAPbX 3
(X = Cl, Br, and I) hybrid perovskite single crystals both in BGTC and BGBC device configurations. The confined crystal growth approach was found to be crucial for the successful integration of hybrid perovskite SCs into FET devices, a class of devices that has been particularly challenging to fabricate and operate for MAPbX 3
semiconductors. In particular, the spatial confinement during the inverse temperature crystallization process produced topographically ultra-smooth top and bottom facets free of grains or domain boundaries and any other corrugations typically observed in free-grown crystals and polycrystalline films. This is credited with producing high-quality semiconductor–dielectric interfaces in the channel, free of common morphological defects and chemical impurities often found on the surface of hybrid perovskite SC polycrystalline films. This approach also eliminates grain boundaries common in polycrystalline films and known to be a source of resistance to lateral transport due to tunnel junction formation. Through vertical confinement, the crystals also easily grew laterally, allowing them to reach millimeter scale or larger and readily bridged FET channels ranging in length from 10 to 150μm. Use of a pre-patterned substrate with metal electrodes furthermore promoted conformal growth of the TSCs into the channel and formed high-quality semiconductor–dielectric interface as well as electrical contacts with strong adhesion. The on/off current ratio in the 10 3 –10 5
range was readily achieved at room temperature. Furthermore, the devices showed low operating voltages (<5 V) with the lowest (<2 V) voltages observed in BCBG devices. Overall, the maximum room temperature hole (electron) mobility ranged from 2.6 to 4.7 (0.26–2.2)cm 2 V −1 s −1
across the different halides and device configurations, with average hole (electron) mobility in the 1.5–2.9 (0.19–1.3)cm 2 V −1 s −1
range, significantly outperforming thin film-based MAPbI 3
FET devices reported to date (Supplementary Table  3 ). During the revision of this paper, a relevant article to the topic of perovskite FETs was published. 61
Demonstration of transparent MAPbCl 3
SCs yielding field-effect saturation hole (electron) mobility as high as 2.6 (2.2)cm 2 V −1 s −1
makes this a potentially interesting material candidate for transparent and imperceptible electronics. Overall, this work demonstrates the feasibility of solution-grown organohalide perovskite FET devices by addressing interfaces and contacts. This makes hybrid perovskites a viable material platform for printed and transparent electronics. Methods Chemicals The CH 3 NH 3 X (X = Cl, Br, and I) were purchased from Dyesol and used as received. Lead halide PbX 2
(X = Cl, Br, and I) dimethylformamide (DMF) and γ-butyrolactone (GBL) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. PET film (2.5 µm thick) was purchased from 2spi.com. TSC synthesis The substrate (glass or Si/SiO 2
pre-patterned with Au electrodes for FET fabrication) and superstrate (glass) with dimensions of 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm were cleaned by rinsing with acetone, iso-proponal, and deionized water in turn. After drying in vacuum oven overnight, the substrates were exposed to UV-O 3
for 10 min. Subsequently, two PET strips were attached to the substrate with a lateral spacing of several millimeters. The superstrate was placed on top and the sandwiched stack was heated to 270 °C on a hot plate for 5 min to melt the PET and help adhere the substrate and the superstrate. The substrates were transferred upon cooling to a nitrogen glove box (below 0.1ppm O 2
and 0.1ppm H 2 O). The hybrid perovskite MAPbX 3
(X = Cl, Br, and I) were resolved in DMF, DMF, and GBL, respectively, at 1 M concentration to prepare the precursor solution in the glove box. A small volume (6 µl) of precursor solution was then injected at the edge of the sandwich and was drawn and spread into the gap through capillary force. Crystal growth was achieved by placing the stack on a hot plate and annealing at a fixed temperature of 60 °C (2 days), 80 °C (2 days), and 100 °C (3 days) for MAPbCl 3 , MAPbBr 3 , and MAPbI 3 , respectively. Characterization UV–Vis absorbance spectra were measured using a Cary 5000 (Varian) spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere. Photoluminescence measurements were conducted on a DXR Smart Raman spectrometer using the excitation lasers at 325 and 473 nm. Fluorescence microscopy measurements were performed in Zeiss LSM 710 Upright Confocal Microscope. Optical micrographs were acquired using a Nikon SMZ25 stereomicroscope. Film and crystal thickness were measured by a DEKTAK 8 profilometer (Veeco). XRD measurements were performed at room temperature using a D8 Discover X-ray diffractometer (Bruker). XRC was measured by Bruker D8 Advance using a wavelength of 1.54 Å and LynxEye XE-T detector with 0D mode. SEM was performed using an FEI Nova Nano 630. 2D SEM was taken on a Phenom ProX system. STM characterization was executed in UHV conditions (5.0 × 10 −10  mbar) in a variable temperature STM (VT-STM; Omicron Nanotechnology). Chemically etched polycrystalline tungsten wire was used as STM tip for imaging, which was further cleaned by electron bombardment in situ in UHV to reach atomically resolved imaging of HOPG. As-grown SC samples on conducting substrate (ITO) were mounted on a sample plate for STM studies. All images were acquired with a tunneling parameter of 2.4 V, 0.6 nA. For XPS measurements, the as-grown samples were grown and sealed in a vial in N 2 -filled glove box, and quickly transferred to the XPS vacuum chamber. XPS studies were carried out using a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer equipped with amonochromatic Al Ka X-ray source ( hν  = 1486.6 eV) operating at 150 W, as well as a multichannel plate and a delay line detector under a vacuum pressure of 1 × 10 −9  mbar. Measurements were performed in hybrid mode using electrostatic and magnetic lenses, and the take-off angle (the angle between the sample surface normal and the electron optical axis of the spectrometer) was 0°. Binding energies were referenced to the C 1s peak of the (C–C, C–H) bond, which was set to 285.0 eV. The data were analyzed using the commercially available software program CASAXPS. FET fabrication and characterization For BGBC FET devices, the Si/SiO 2
substrates (capacitance
C i
of 15nFcm −2 ) with gold pattern were used as substrates. For BGTC FET devices, perovskite TSCs were first grown on the Si/SiO 2
substrates, and then 80 nm Au electrode was thermally evaporated on top with masks. Different lengths (10, 20, 50, 100, and 150 μm) were utilized. The channel width ( W ) depends upon the lateral size of the TSC and was measured individually for each TSC that was successfully grown on a pair of FET device electrodes.
I–V
measurements were performed at room temperature using a Keithley 4200 Semiconductor Parametric Analyzer and a Signotone Micromanipulator S-1160 probe station in continuous mode. The measuring process was conducted under vacuum.

Abstract Organolead trihalide perovskite materials have been successfully used as light absorbers in efficient photovoltaic cells. Two different cell structures, based on mesoscopic metal oxides and planar heterojunctions have already demonstrated very impressive advances in performance. Here, we report a bilayer architecture comprising the key features of mesoscopic and planar structures obtained by a fully solution-based process. We used CH 3 NH 3
Pb(I 1  −  x Br x ) 3
( x
= 0.1–0.15) as the absorbing layer and poly(triarylamine) as a hole-transporting material. The use of a mixed solvent of γ-butyrolactone and dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) followed by toluene drop-casting leads to extremely uniform and dense perovskite layers via a CH 3 NH 3 I–PbI 2 –DMSO intermediate phase, and enables the fabrication of remarkably improved solar cells with a certified power-conversion efficiency of 16.2% and no hysteresis. These results provide important progress towards the understanding of the role of solution-processing in the realization of low-cost and highly efficient perovskite solar cells.

Main Today, crystalline silicon dominates the solar panel industry but remains relatively expensive to manufacture. If devices could be fabricated from cheap materials by a simple solution process without annealing at high temperature, their costs could be considerably reduced through mass production. Although dye-sensitized 1 , quantum dot 2 , 3 , organic 4 , 5 , and inorganic–organic heterojunction solar cells 6 , 7
can be fabricated by multiple or single solution processes, the cells still suffer from problems such as a lack of long-term stability and low conversion efficiency due to fundamental energy losses associated with the extensive interface for charge separation. Recently, methylammonium lead halide (MAPbX 3 , where MA is methylammonium CH 3 NH 3
and X is a halogen) perovskites 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16
have offered the promise of a breakthrough for next-generation solar devices. The use of perovskites affords several advantages: excellent optical properties that are tunable by managing chemical compositions 13 ; ambipolar charge transport 10 ; and very long electron–hole diffusion lengths 17 , 18 . Perovskite materials have been applied as light absorbers to thin or thick mesoscopic metal oxides and planar heterojunction solar devices. For example, when MAPbI 3
was loaded on a mesoporous (mp)-TiO 2
electrode by the sequential deposition of PbI 2
and methylammonium iodide (MAI), a 15.0% power-conversion efficiency (PCE) was achieved under 1 sun illumination 11 . The authors of ref.  12
reported a maximum performance of 15.4% efficiency with an open-circuit voltage ( V oc ) of 1.07 V and short-circuit current density ( J sc ) of 21.5 mA cm −2 , based on uniform MAPbI 3 −  x Cl x
planar thin layers deposited by the vacuum thermal evaporation method without the mp-TiO 2
electrode. Several other groups also reported efficient planar solar cells, based on normal organic photovoltaic structure 12 , 19 . Although very impressive cell efficiencies have been achieved, the cell architecture, use of vacuum, or the two-step deposition process should be modified to improve efficiency and reduce fabrication cost. Spin-coating, one of the cheapest film production methods, is widely used in solution-processed perovskite solar cells. Evaporation and the convective self-assembly process during spinning immediately induce the formation of well-crystallized perovskite materials due to strong ionic interactions between the metal cations and halogen anions. Generally, γ-butyrolactone (GBL),
N , N -dimethylformamide, DMSO and
N -methyl-2-pyrrolidone are used as effective solvents for lead halides and MAI. However, simple spin-coating did not yield a homogeneous perovskite layer having uniform thickness over a large area 20 , although the convective spreading flow due to centrifugal force was applied to the slowly evaporating solvents. Previously, we reported the formation of a pillared structure with an island-type upper layer 10 , and proposed the importance of a homogeneous upper layer on the mp-TiO 2
base; however, we were unable to deposit uniform thin films by the solution process. Furthermore, it was reported that the uniformity of the perovskite films depended on the thickness of the TiO 2
compact layer, and modification of the spinning conditions could not achieve 100% surface coverage 20 . This limited the applicability of the solution process. Here, we report the solution-process fabrication of efficient perovskite solar cells comprising a bilayer architecture and MAPb(I 1 −  x Br x ) 3
perovskites formed by a solvent-engineering technology. The MAPb(I 1 −  x Br x ) 3
perovskite composition was used because the substitution of 10–15 mol% Br −
for I −
in MAPbI 3
greatly improved the stability in ambient atmosphere, and the dual halide material demonstrated similar performance over the compositional range 13 . When the perovskite was deposited using a mixture of GBL and DMSO, followed by a toluene drip while spinning, extremely uniform and dense layers were formed. This solvent-engineering technology enabled a fully solution-processed perovskite solar cell with a certified 16.2% power-conversion efficiency under standard reporting conditions. Figure 1
presents a schematic diagram of the cell architecture and deposition of perovskite materials by the solvent-engineering technology by means of spin-coating, as well as X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the resulting coatings. The cell architecture ( Fig. 1a ) reveals a bilayer structure comprising mesoscopic and planar structures, and is effective for sufficiently absorbing light and collecting charges. Atop the mp-TiO 2
layer lies a highly uniform perovskite active layer (100–300 nm thick). Poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) and Au metal were next deposited on the active layer as a hole-transporting material and photocathode, respectively. For this architecture, the formation of a homogeneous thin perovskite layer is extremely important, and we developed our solvent-engineering technology as an effective tool for creating such a layer. The process involves five stages, as depicted in
Fig. 1c . First, a mixture of MAI, MABr, PbI 2 , PbBr 2 , GBL and DMSO in the appropriate ratio is spread over the entire surface of the substrate. Second, the spin-coater is accelerated to the desired rotational speed and maintained there for several tens of seconds to evaporate the solvent. Third, a solvent that does not dissolve the perovskite materials and is miscible with DMSO and GBL (for example, toluene or chloroform) is dripped on the substrate during spinning. Fourth, all constituents are frozen into a uniform layer on the removal of the residual DMSO and then a new complex as an intermediate phase is formed (see below). Finally, the complex is converted into highly uniform and crystalline perovskite on annealing at 100 °C for 10 min ( Fig. 1b ). As is apparent from
Supplementary Fig. 1 , the morphology of the perovskite thin layer is markedly changed by this solvent-engineering process, as compared with model systems on quartz substrate. In pure GBL, the perovskite crystals formed immediately, and the colour of the film on the substrate changed to dark hazy brown during rotation at 5,000 r.p.m, regardless of the application of the toluene drip. The resulting morphology appears as inhomogeneous islands with low coverage on the substrate ( Supplementary Fig. 1a ). In contrast, in the DMSO and GBL mixed solvent, the colour change to dark brown is not observed during spin-coating, even after 5 min rotation. The spin-coated layer formed with the solvent mixture followed by the toluene drip is extremely uniform and transparent, and covers the full surface with low surface roughness. Without the toluene drip treatment, the resulting material adopts a textile-like inhomogeneous layer that does not fully cover the substrate, and perovskite crystals are formed from the coating after annealing at 100 °C ( Supplementary Fig. 1b ). Here, the crystallinity of the perovskite films is almost the same regardless of the toluene drop-casting, as can be seen in values of full-width at half-maximum of (110) XRD peaks of
Supplementary Fig. 2 . Therefore, the solvent-engineering technique is critically important for this process.

b , XRD pattern of the annealed perovskite coating on fused silica substrate. The inset shows a SEM image of a surface consisting of a glass/FTO/bl-TiO 2 /mp-TiO 2 -perovskite nanocomposite layer/perovskite upper layer.
c , Solvent engineering procedure for preparing the uniform and dense perovskite film. Full size image To gain further insight into the mixed-solvent application and subsequent toluene drip treatment, we isolated the intermediate phase formed by pouring MAI and PbI 2
dissolved in GBL and DMSO into toluene. In this experiment, we excluded the doping of MABr and PbBr 2
to simplify our analysis. The XRD profiles shown in
Fig. 2a
imply that the resultant intermediate phase is self-organized and highly crystalline in nature. Therefore, we think that the phase formed on toluene drop-casting in step 3 of
Fig. 1c
has a well-developed crystalline form. To get further information for the phase, we compared it with the XRD patterns for PbI 2 , MAI and PbI 2 (DMSO) 2 , because the constituents in the mixed solvent can be simply precipitated in the non-dissolving solvent. Here, PbI 2
as a layered semiconductor material contains a plane of Pb ions sandwiched between adjacent layers of hexagonally arranged iodide ions. The interlayer spaces allow rapid intercalation of different guest molecules owing to the weak bonding between the two planes by van der Waals-type interactions, leading to the expansion of the interlayer distance along the
c
axis 21 . It was known that the DMSO used as a solvent in this work can coordinate with lead halide to form a PbI 2 (DMSO) 2
complex 22 . However, as can be seen in the figure, the isolated powder is a new and unreported compound that cannot be assigned to reported materials, and is related to the intermediate phase formed during perovskite deposition from DMSO and GBL. Thus, we considered a MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO complex as a possible crystalline compound that can be formed from the solution mixture. In the DMSO and GBL solution mixture, GBL functions purely as a solvent, which has a relatively higher evaporation rate than DMSO during spinning; XRD patterns of the intermediate phase completely matched the material isolated from DMSO in the absence of GBL. The mass percentage for a given element in MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO (C 3 H 12 NSOPbI 3 ) requires H = 1.7%; C = 5.2%; N = 2.0%; O = 2.3%; S = 4.6%; Pb = 29.7%; and I = 54.5%. Elemental analysis of the intermediate phase yielded the following percentages by weight: H = 1.6%; C = 4.6%; N = 2.0%; O = 2.2%; and S = 3.7%; with a remainder of 85.9%. If the residue is assumed to be Pb and 3I, the weight percentages of Pb and I can be determined as 30% and 55.9%, respectively. As expected, the average atomic mass formula from elemental analysis is in agreement with MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO. In addition, the intercalation of both MAI and DMSO into PbI 2
can be observed by XRD peaks at low angles (6.55°, 7.21° and 9.17°). The appearance of XRD peaks at low angles indicates that the MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO intermediate phase has longer interplanar distances, which are different from those in the DMSO–PbI 2 –DMSO complex, by the substitution of MAI for DMSO. The presence of MAI and DMSO in PbI 2
is further confirmed from the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectrum for the intermediate phase.
Figure 2b
reveals the following spectral features and peak positions for the isolated powder; S–O and C–S stretching vibrations from DMSO coordinated to Pb 2+
at 1,012 cm −1 ; N–H stretching in the range about 3,200–3,450 cm −1 ; and C–H stretching in the range about 2,800–2,950 cm −1 . The FTIR spectra of MAI, PbI 2 , DMSO–PbI 2 –DMSO, MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO and MAPbI 3
are provided in
Supplementary Fig. 3
for functional group comparison. The detection of both the N–H and S–O deformation modes in the intermediate phase guarantees the successful inclusion of a solvent molecule (DMSO) and MAI into the PbI 2 . Furthermore, the C=C mode indicative of the toluene dripping solvent is not detected. Figure 2: XRD and FTIR of the intermediate phase and scheme for the formation of perovskite material via the intermediate phase. a , XRD spectra of PbI 2
(haematite, JCPDS file No. 07-0235), MAI, PbI 2 (DMSO) 2
and MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO intermediate phase powders. Comparing the XRD patterns of these powders, it is seen that the intermediate phase is different from the PbI 2 , MAI and PbI 2 (DMSO) 2
phases.
b , FTIR spectrum of the MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO intermediate phase. N–H stretching and bending reveal that the intermediate phase includes MAI molecules.
c , XRD spectra of the MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO intermediate phase powder as a function of temperature. The intermediate phase is completely changed compared with the perovskite phase at 130 °C.
d , Scheme for the formation of the perovskite material via the MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO intermediate phase. (i) PbI 2
consisting of edge-sharing [PbI 6 ] 4− -octahedral layers. (ii) MAI and DMSO guest molecules intercalated between the layers, forming the flat MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO intermediate phase film, when toluene is introduced onto the wet film comprising PbI 2 , MAI and DMSO. Here, the positions of the guest molecules are unconfirmed. (iii) Finally, the intermediate phase film is converted to the perovskite phase with corner-sharing octahedra via the extraction of DMSO guest molecules by the annealing process. The perovskite film is extremely uniform and flat because of the solid-state conversion from the uniform and flat intermediate phase film. Full size image The conversion of the intermediate phase into perovskite with annealing temperature was monitored by
in situ
high-temperature XRD. The low-angle diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern of
Fig. 2c
clearly show that, with increasing temperature, the putative MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO disappears and new peaks are observed due to the appearance of MAPbI 3
perovskite. We see that the formation of the perovskite phase is accompanied by the complete transformation of the MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO at 130 °C, whereas both MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO and perovskite phases coexist at 100 °C. On the basis of the above observations, we propose a plausible mechanism for the formation of the uniform and dense perovskite layer during spin-coating from MAI, PbI 2
and DMSO with a toluene drip treatment. As shown in
Fig. 2d , at the initial stage during spinning, the film is composed of MAI and PbI 2
dissolved in the DMSO/GBL solvent mixture, whereas in the intermediate stage, the composition of the film is concentrated by the evaporation of GBL. Then the toluene droplets lead to the immediate freezing of the constituents on spinning via the quick removal of the excess DMSO solvent and the rapid formation of the MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO phase, leaving a uniform and transparent thin layer ( Supplementary Fig. 1d ). The role of DMSO in the MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO phase is to retard the rapid reaction between PbI 2
and MAI during the evaporation of solvent in the spin-coating process. Finally, the extremely homogeneous flat film (shown in
Fig. 3a ) is converted into a pure crystalline MAPbI 3
perovskite layer after annealing at 100 °C. In this process, the key material is the flat film consisting of MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO. These behaviours do not change by using the mixed-halide materials, MAPb(I 1 −  x Br x ) 3
( x
= 0.1–0.15). Figure 3: AFM and SEM images of a perovskite device. a , b , AFM topography (left) and three-dimensional views (right) of the surface of the intermediate phase ( a ) and resulting perovskite film ( b ). The size of the AFM images is 3 × 3 μm 2 . The measured root mean square roughness is 6.0 nm ( a ) and 8.3 nm ( b ).
c , Higher-magnification SEM image of the upper layer.
d , Cross-sectional SEM image of a complete perovskite device. Full size image Accordingly, the formation of the intermediate phase is a critical factor for smoothing the surface via dropwise toluene application, which finally results in compact and uniform thin layers.
Figure 3
illustrates images obtained by atomic force microscopy (AFM) for the intermediate film and the perovskite film on fused silica substrate, and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the surface of the perovskite upper layer and the cross-section of a representative cell formed by our solvent-engineering technology. As can be seen in the three-dimensional AFM images and topography of
Fig. 3a,b , the root mean square roughness values for the intermediate phase and crystalline perovskite layer are 6.0 and 8.3 nm, respectively, even though the formation of the perovskite from the intermediate layer gave slightly increased roughness. In
Fig. 3c , we can observe that the surface exhibits a dense-grained uniform morphology with grain sizes in the range 100–500 nm. The entire film is composed of a homogeneous, well-crystallized perovskite layer. In addition, from a typical cross-sectional SEM image of a real device, we can see two uniform layers consisting of a TiO 2 /perovskite nanocomposite and the pure perovskite ( Fig. 3d ); the perovskite materials are fully infiltrated into the pores of the mp-TiO 2
film, and also deposited in a very uniform thick film with 100% surface coverage atop the mp-TiO 2 , compared with the conventional method 10 , 11 . To fabricate efficient solar cells, the active layer of the light harvester must be thick enough to absorb sufficient incident light. Fortunately, the high absorption coefficient ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ) of a perovskite light absorber film allows the use of very thin layers ( ∼ 330 nm thick) to absorb the entire range of visible light. Indeed, the authors of ref.
12
fabricated a highly efficient thin solar cell exceeding 15% efficiency with a perovskite absorber (MAPbI 1 −  x Cl x ) of
∼ 300 nm without mp-TiO 2 , and reported that the MAPbI 1 −  x Cl x
perovskite had a long diffusion length (> 1 μm; ref.  17 ). These results encouraged us to fabricate a thin-film solar cell using MAPb(I 1 −  x Br x ) 3
( x  = 0.1–0.15) with a thickness of 350 nm in the absence of mp-TiO 2 . We were able to fabricate thin-film solar cells with extremely uniform, dense layers ( Fig. 3a–c ) by our solvent-engineering technology.
Figure 4a
presents the
I – V
curves for a cell fabricated without the mp-TiO 2
layer, measured with a 40 ms scanning delay in reverse (from the open-circuit voltage ( V oc ) to the short-circuit current ( I sc )) and forward (that is, from
I sc
to
V oc ) modes under standard air-mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5 G) illumination.
Table 1
summarizes the extracted short-circuit current density ( J sc ),
V oc
and fill factor (FF). Apparently, there is a large hysteresis and distortion in the
I – V
curves. The
J sc ,
V oc
and FF values obtained from the
I – V
curve of the reverse scan were 19.2 mA cm −2 , 1.09 V and 0.69, respectively, yielding a PCE of 14.4% under standard AM 1.5 conditions. In contrast, the corresponding values from the
I – V
curve of the forward scan were 19.2 mA cm −2 , 1.07 V and 0.44, respectively, showing a pronounced discrepancy of 9.1% in overall efficiency. Such hysteresis and the discrepancy result in the underestimation of the real
J – V
curves in the forward scan and overestimation in the reverse scan. Typically, reliable solar cell
I–V
measurements should exhibit coincident curves for both the forward and reverse scans. In some cases, depending on the cells, the measurements must be carried out with longer scanning delays. Thus, the efficiencies for the cell without the mp-TiO 2
layer were compared between the forward and reverse scans at various delay times ranging from 10 to 300 ms. As can be seen in
Supplementary Fig. 5a
the efficiency decreased from 11.0 to 7.0% in the forward scan and from 16.5 to 8.5% in the reverse scan, as the delay time increased from 10 to 300 ms. The efficiencies did not approach similar values even when the scan time was long. Furthermore, the average efficiency from the reverse and forward scans continued to decline with increasing delay time. Thus, the large discrepancy and discordance with scan direction and delay time can induce a considerable error in evaluating cell efficiency. In contrast, the
J – V
curves of the forward and reverse scans of the cell with the bilayer architecture {FTO/blocking layer (bl)-TiO 2 /mp-TiO 2
( ∼ 200 nm)/upper layer ( ∼ 200 nm)/PTAA (50 nm)/Au} ( Fig. 4b ) were well coincident. Moreover, the efficiency and average efficiency from both scan directions were symmetrical and identical regardless of the scanning direction, and results using a significantly shorter delay time were coincident with those from a cell lacking the mp-TiO 2
( Supplementary Fig. 5b ). The
J sc ,
V oc
and FF values obtained from the
I – V
curves of
Fig. 4b
for the reverse and forward scans are summarized in
Table 1 , and the overall efficiencies for both scan directions under the standard method are 15.8 and 15.9% with an average of 15.85%, clearly showing the reliability of the
I–V
measurements. Generally, the average value of the efficiency, determined from the forward and reverse scans should be widely accepted when the scanning delay time is longer than 40 ms (ref.  23 ), because an excessively long time to complete the measurement is impractical.

c , Relationship between the power-conversion efficiency of the perovskite cells versus the thickness of the mp-TiO 2
layer. For each thickness, 12 cells were characterized. The error bars represent maximum and minimum efficiency values (vertical) and thickness values (horizontal; thickness calculated from SEM cross-sections). Full size image Table 1 Photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells without mp-TiO 2
or with 200-nm-thick mp-TiO 2 . Full size table For a deeper understanding of the dependence of the
I – V
parameters on both scan directions, we investigated the difference between the forward and reverse scans for a 40 ms scan time as a function of the thickness of the mp-TiO 2
layer. As the layer thickness increased to ~200 nm, the difference in efficiency between the forward and reverse scans reached a minimum, and then again deviated slightly with continuing mp-TiO 2
thickness increases ( Fig. 4c ). Interestingly, the efficiency measured in the reverse scan did not vary greatly with the mp-TiO 2
thickness, whereas the forward scan yielded a pronounced variation, resulting in a large discrepancy between the two scan directions. Such a strong dependence of the measured efficiency on the scan direction with mp-TiO 2
thickness suggests that solar cells fabricated from MAPbX 3
perovskite materials operate differently than other types of cells such as organic, dye-sensitized, and conventional Si solar cells. The stepwise increase or decrease in the bias voltage, corresponding to a reverse or forward scan, respectively, requires a charge redistribution to reach a new equilibrium state. These characteristics of perovskite solar cells may be related to the large diffusion capacitance of such cells operating under reverse or forward biases 24 . The large capacitance is assumed to be related to the underestimation in the forward scan and overestimation in the reverse scan by charging and discharging during the voltage sweep in the solar cells. In other words, the generated charge (electrons or holes) may persist in the perovskite owing to the slow charge collection in the thick perovskite layer, and require significant time for charge distribution. This would impede a quick response to the rapid scanning of the applied voltage for the
I – V
measurements. Therefore, the slow charge collection via the perovskite material itself must be improved to eliminate the large discrepancy with scan direction, and an optimally thick mp-TiO 2
layer must be introduced for efficient charge collection from the perovskite via the large TiO 2
interface. Eventually, it will be very important to impart effective charge collection and light absorption properties through a balance in the ratios between the perovskite-infiltrated TiO 2
layer and the thin upper layers. Of course, the tendency for discrepancy according to scan direction can be related to the perovskite composition, because the exciton diffusion length was markedly changed by doping Cl ions into MAPbI 3
(ref.  17 ). To further enhance the performance of our cells fabricated by solvent engineering, we repeated the fabrication procedure using mp-TiO 2
with a thickness of
∼ 200 nm. The
J – V
curves and incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectrum of the best performing solar cell are presented in
Fig. 5 . The average values from the
J – V
curves from the reverse and forward scans ( Fig. 5a ) exhibited a
J sc
of 19.58 mA cm −2 ,
V oc
of 1.105 V, and FF of 76.2%, corresponding to a PCE of 16.5% under standard AM 1.5 G conditions. The best device also showed a very broad IPCE plateau of over 80% between 420 and 700 nm, as shown in
Fig. 5b . The
J sc
value integrated from the IPCE agreed well with that measured by
I – V . In
Fig. 5c
a histogram of the average PCEs for all of the independently fabricated cells contributing to our study is presented. Around 80% of the cells made using our process exhibited an overall efficiency exceeding of 15% under 1 sun conditions, proving the conceptual validity of a balanced thickness between the TiO 2
and thin upper layers. In addition, an evaluation of the available results allows us to conclude that this solvent-engineering approach provides a simple and effective means for realizing high-efficiency and low-cost perovskite-based solar cells. One of these devices was certified by the standardized method in a photovoltaics calibration laboratory, confirming a PCE of 16.2% under AM 1.5 G full sun ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ). Figure 5:

Full size image In summary, we developed a solvent-engineering technology for the deposition of extremely uniform perovskite layers, and demonstrated a solution-processed perovskite solar cell with 16.5% PCE under standard conditions (AM 1.5 G radiation, 100 mW cm −2 ). We proposed a plausible mechanism for the formation of uniform and dense perovskite layers during the solvent-engineering process. The formation of a stable MAI(Br)–PbI 2 –DMSO phase via an intercalation process during the dropwise application of a non-dissolving solvent was a decisive factor in retarding the rapid reaction between MAI(Br) and PbI(Br) 2 , which enabled the formation of a highly uniform and dense surface. Furthermore, we found that thick perovskite cells fabricated without mp-TiO 2
showed a large hysteresis and distortion between reverse and forward scans, and raised arguments about the estimation of conversion efficiencies for perovskite cells. Hence, the ratio of the thicknesses of the perovskite-infiltrated mp-TiO 2
and the pure perovskite should be optimized to fabricate efficient perovskite cells with coincident reverse and forward scans. These results will provide an effective strategy for forming uniform PbI 2 -based perovskite layers through intercalation, and lead to more efficient and cost-effective inorganic–organic hybrid heterojunction solar cells in the future. Methods Solar cell fabrication. A dense blocking layer of TiO 2
(bl-TiO 2 ,
∼ 70 nm in thickness) was deposited onto a F-doped SnO 2
(FTO, Pilkington, TEC8) substrate by spray pyrolysis, using a 20 mM titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution (Aldrich) at 450 °C to prevent direct contact between the FTO and the hole-conducting layer. A 200–300-nm-thick mesoporous TiO 2
(particle size: about 50 nm, crystalline phase: anatase) film was spin-coated onto the bl-TiO 2 /FTO substrate using home-made pastes 14
and calcining at 500 °C for 1 h in air to remove organic components. CH 3 NH 3 I (MAI) and CH 3 NH 3 Br (MABr) were first synthesized by reacting 27.86 ml CH 3 NH 2
(40% in methanol, Junsei Chemical) and 30 ml HI (57 wt% in water, Aldrich) or 44 ml HBr (48 wt% in water, Aldrich) in a 250 ml round-bottom flask at 0 °C for 4 h with stirring, respectively. The precipitate was recovered by evaporation at 55 °C for 1 h. MAI and MABr were dissolved in ethanol, recrystallized from diethyl ether, and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h. The prepared MAI and MABr powders, PbI 2
(Aldrich) and PbBr 2
(Aldrich) for 0.8 M MAPb(I 1 −  x Br x ) 3
( x
= 0.1–0.15) solution were stirred in a mixture of GBL and DMSO (7:3 v/v) at 60 °C for 12 h. The resulting solution was coated onto the mp-TiO 2 /bl-TiO 2 /FTO substrate by a consecutive two-step spin-coating process at 1,000 and 5,000 r.p.m for 10 and 20 s, respectively. During the second spin-coating step, the substrate (around 1 cm × 1 cm) was treated with toluene drop-casting. A detailed time-rotation profile for the spin-coating is represented in
Supplementary Fig. 1c . The substrate was dried on a hot plate at 100 °C for 10 min. A solution of poly(triarylamine) (15 mg, PTAA, EM Index,
M w
= 17,500 g mol −1 ) in toluene (1.5 ml) was mixed with 15 μl of a solution of lithium bistrifluoromethanesulphonimidate (170 mg) in acetonitrile (1 ml) and 7.5 μl 4- tert -butylpyridine and spin-coated on the MAPb(I 1 −  x Br x ) 3
( x
= 0.1–0.15)/mp-TiO 2 /bl-TiO 2 /FTO substrate at 3,000 r.p.m for 30 s. Finally, a Au counterelectrode was deposited by thermal evaporation. The active area of this electrode was fixed at 0.16 cm 2 . Characterization. The XRD spectra of the prepared films were measured using a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer, and
in situ
XRD experiments of the powder isolated as an intermediate phase were performed using a Rigaku Ultima IV with an X-ray tube (Cu Kα,
λ
= 1.5406 Å). The elemental analysis (C, H, N and S) of the complex was performed using a FISONS EA–1108 CHN analyser. The FTIR spectra (4,000–500 cm −1 ) were recorded on a Bruker EQUINOX 55 spectrophotometer with samples prepared by the KBr pellet method. Ultraviolet–visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV 2550 spectrophotometer in the 200–800 nm wavelength range at room temperature. AFM was performed using Bruker multimode 8 in ‘tapping’ mode. The IPCE was measured using a power source (Newport 300 W xenon lamp, 66920) with a monochromator (Newport Cornerstone 260) and a multimeter (Keithley 2001).
J – V
curves were measured using a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Class A, 91195A) with a source meter (Keithley 2420) at 100 mW cm −2 , AM 1.5 G illumination, and a calibrated Si-reference cell certified by the NREL. The
J – V
curves were measured by reverse (forward bias (1.2 V) → short circuit (0 V)) or forward (short circuit (0 V) → forward bias (1.2 V)) scan. The step voltage was fixed at 10 mV and the delay time, which is a set delay at each voltage step before measuring each current, was modulated.
J – V
curves for all devices were measured by masking the active area with a metal mask 0.094 cm −2
in area.

Abstract Organolead trihalide perovskite materials have been successfully used as light absorbers in efficient photovoltaic cells. Two different cell structures, based on mesoscopic metal oxides and planar heterojunctions have already demonstrated very impressive advances in performance. Here, we report a bilayer architecture comprising the key features of mesoscopic and planar structures obtained by a fully solution-based process. We used CH 3 NH 3
Pb(I 1  −  x Br x ) 3
( x
= 0.1–0.15) as the absorbing layer and poly(triarylamine) as a hole-transporting material. The use of a mixed solvent of γ-butyrolactone and dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) followed by toluene drop-casting leads to extremely uniform and dense perovskite layers via a CH 3 NH 3 I–PbI 2 –DMSO intermediate phase, and enables the fabrication of remarkably improved solar cells with a certified power-conversion efficiency of 16.2% and no hysteresis. These results provide important progress towards the understanding of the role of solution-processing in the realization of low-cost and highly efficient perovskite solar cells.

Main Today, crystalline silicon dominates the solar panel industry but remains relatively expensive to manufacture. If devices could be fabricated from cheap materials by a simple solution process without annealing at high temperature, their costs could be considerably reduced through mass production. Although dye-sensitized 1 , quantum dot 2 , 3 , organic 4 , 5 , and inorganic–organic heterojunction solar cells 6 , 7
can be fabricated by multiple or single solution processes, the cells still suffer from problems such as a lack of long-term stability and low conversion efficiency due to fundamental energy losses associated with the extensive interface for charge separation. Recently, methylammonium lead halide (MAPbX 3 , where MA is methylammonium CH 3 NH 3
and X is a halogen) perovskites 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16
have offered the promise of a breakthrough for next-generation solar devices. The use of perovskites affords several advantages: excellent optical properties that are tunable by managing chemical compositions 13 ; ambipolar charge transport 10 ; and very long electron–hole diffusion lengths 17 , 18 . Perovskite materials have been applied as light absorbers to thin or thick mesoscopic metal oxides and planar heterojunction solar devices. For example, when MAPbI 3
was loaded on a mesoporous (mp)-TiO 2
electrode by the sequential deposition of PbI 2
and methylammonium iodide (MAI), a 15.0% power-conversion efficiency (PCE) was achieved under 1 sun illumination 11 . The authors of ref.  12
reported a maximum performance of 15.4% efficiency with an open-circuit voltage ( V oc ) of 1.07 V and short-circuit current density ( J sc ) of 21.5 mA cm −2 , based on uniform MAPbI 3 −  x Cl x
planar thin layers deposited by the vacuum thermal evaporation method without the mp-TiO 2
electrode. Several other groups also reported efficient planar solar cells, based on normal organic photovoltaic structure 12 , 19 . Although very impressive cell efficiencies have been achieved, the cell architecture, use of vacuum, or the two-step deposition process should be modified to improve efficiency and reduce fabrication cost. Spin-coating, one of the cheapest film production methods, is widely used in solution-processed perovskite solar cells. Evaporation and the convective self-assembly process during spinning immediately induce the formation of well-crystallized perovskite materials due to strong ionic interactions between the metal cations and halogen anions. Generally, γ-butyrolactone (GBL),
N , N -dimethylformamide, DMSO and
N -methyl-2-pyrrolidone are used as effective solvents for lead halides and MAI. However, simple spin-coating did not yield a homogeneous perovskite layer having uniform thickness over a large area 20 , although the convective spreading flow due to centrifugal force was applied to the slowly evaporating solvents. Previously, we reported the formation of a pillared structure with an island-type upper layer 10 , and proposed the importance of a homogeneous upper layer on the mp-TiO 2
base; however, we were unable to deposit uniform thin films by the solution process. Furthermore, it was reported that the uniformity of the perovskite films depended on the thickness of the TiO 2
compact layer, and modification of the spinning conditions could not achieve 100% surface coverage 20 . This limited the applicability of the solution process. Here, we report the solution-process fabrication of efficient perovskite solar cells comprising a bilayer architecture and MAPb(I 1 −  x Br x ) 3
perovskites formed by a solvent-engineering technology. The MAPb(I 1 −  x Br x ) 3
perovskite composition was used because the substitution of 10–15 mol% Br −
for I −
in MAPbI 3
greatly improved the stability in ambient atmosphere, and the dual halide material demonstrated similar performance over the compositional range 13 . When the perovskite was deposited using a mixture of GBL and DMSO, followed by a toluene drip while spinning, extremely uniform and dense layers were formed. This solvent-engineering technology enabled a fully solution-processed perovskite solar cell with a certified 16.2% power-conversion efficiency under standard reporting conditions. Figure 1
presents a schematic diagram of the cell architecture and deposition of perovskite materials by the solvent-engineering technology by means of spin-coating, as well as X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the resulting coatings. The cell architecture ( Fig. 1a ) reveals a bilayer structure comprising mesoscopic and planar structures, and is effective for sufficiently absorbing light and collecting charges. Atop the mp-TiO 2
layer lies a highly uniform perovskite active layer (100–300 nm thick). Poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) and Au metal were next deposited on the active layer as a hole-transporting material and photocathode, respectively. For this architecture, the formation of a homogeneous thin perovskite layer is extremely important, and we developed our solvent-engineering technology as an effective tool for creating such a layer. The process involves five stages, as depicted in
Fig. 1c . First, a mixture of MAI, MABr, PbI 2 , PbBr 2 , GBL and DMSO in the appropriate ratio is spread over the entire surface of the substrate. Second, the spin-coater is accelerated to the desired rotational speed and maintained there for several tens of seconds to evaporate the solvent. Third, a solvent that does not dissolve the perovskite materials and is miscible with DMSO and GBL (for example, toluene or chloroform) is dripped on the substrate during spinning. Fourth, all constituents are frozen into a uniform layer on the removal of the residual DMSO and then a new complex as an intermediate phase is formed (see below). Finally, the complex is converted into highly uniform and crystalline perovskite on annealing at 100 °C for 10 min ( Fig. 1b ). As is apparent from
Supplementary Fig. 1 , the morphology of the perovskite thin layer is markedly changed by this solvent-engineering process, as compared with model systems on quartz substrate. In pure GBL, the perovskite crystals formed immediately, and the colour of the film on the substrate changed to dark hazy brown during rotation at 5,000 r.p.m, regardless of the application of the toluene drip. The resulting morphology appears as inhomogeneous islands with low coverage on the substrate ( Supplementary Fig. 1a ). In contrast, in the DMSO and GBL mixed solvent, the colour change to dark brown is not observed during spin-coating, even after 5 min rotation. The spin-coated layer formed with the solvent mixture followed by the toluene drip is extremely uniform and transparent, and covers the full surface with low surface roughness. Without the toluene drip treatment, the resulting material adopts a textile-like inhomogeneous layer that does not fully cover the substrate, and perovskite crystals are formed from the coating after annealing at 100 °C ( Supplementary Fig. 1b ). Here, the crystallinity of the perovskite films is almost the same regardless of the toluene drop-casting, as can be seen in values of full-width at half-maximum of (110) XRD peaks of
Supplementary Fig. 2 . Therefore, the solvent-engineering technique is critically important for this process. Figure 1: Device architecture, scheme of solvent engineering process, and XRD of perovskite layer. a , Device architecture of the bilayered perovskite solar cell (glass/FTO/bl-TiO 2 /mp-TiO 2 -perovskite nanocomposite layer/perovskite upper layer/PTAA/Au).
b , XRD pattern of the annealed perovskite coating on fused silica substrate. The inset shows a SEM image of a surface consisting of a glass/FTO/bl-TiO 2 /mp-TiO 2 -perovskite nanocomposite layer/perovskite upper layer.
c , Solvent engineering procedure for preparing the uniform and dense perovskite film. Full size image To gain further insight into the mixed-solvent application and subsequent toluene drip treatment, we isolated the intermediate phase formed by pouring MAI and PbI 2
dissolved in GBL and DMSO into toluene. In this experiment, we excluded the doping of MABr and PbBr 2
to simplify our analysis. The XRD profiles shown in
Fig. 2a
imply that the resultant intermediate phase is self-organized and highly crystalline in nature. Therefore, we think that the phase formed on toluene drop-casting in step 3 of
Fig. 1c
has a well-developed crystalline form. To get further information for the phase, we compared it with the XRD patterns for PbI 2 , MAI and PbI 2 (DMSO) 2 , because the constituents in the mixed solvent can be simply precipitated in the non-dissolving solvent. Here, PbI 2
as a layered semiconductor material contains a plane of Pb ions sandwiched between adjacent layers of hexagonally arranged iodide ions. The interlayer spaces allow rapid intercalation of different guest molecules owing to the weak bonding between the two planes by van der Waals-type interactions, leading to the expansion of the interlayer distance along the
c
axis 21 . It was known that the DMSO used as a solvent in this work can coordinate with lead halide to form a PbI 2 (DMSO) 2
complex 22 . However, as can be seen in the figure, the isolated powder is a new and unreported compound that cannot be assigned to reported materials, and is related to the intermediate phase formed during perovskite deposition from DMSO and GBL. Thus, we considered a MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO complex as a possible crystalline compound that can be formed from the solution mixture. In the DMSO and GBL solution mixture, GBL functions purely as a solvent, which has a relatively higher evaporation rate than DMSO during spinning; XRD patterns of the intermediate phase completely matched the material isolated from DMSO in the absence of GBL. The mass percentage for a given element in MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO (C 3 H 12 NSOPbI 3 ) requires H = 1.7%; C = 5.2%; N = 2.0%; O = 2.3%; S = 4.6%; Pb = 29.7%; and I = 54.5%. Elemental analysis of the intermediate phase yielded the following percentages by weight: H = 1.6%; C = 4.6%; N = 2.0%; O = 2.2%; and S = 3.7%; with a remainder of 85.9%. If the residue is assumed to be Pb and 3I, the weight percentages of Pb and I can be determined as 30% and 55.9%, respectively. As expected, the average atomic mass formula from elemental analysis is in agreement with MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO. In addition, the intercalation of both MAI and DMSO into PbI 2
can be observed by XRD peaks at low angles (6.55°, 7.21° and 9.17°). The appearance of XRD peaks at low angles indicates that the MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO intermediate phase has longer interplanar distances, which are different from those in the DMSO–PbI 2 –DMSO complex, by the substitution of MAI for DMSO. The presence of MAI and DMSO in PbI 2
is further confirmed from the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectrum for the intermediate phase.
Figure 2b
reveals the following spectral features and peak positions for the isolated powder; S–O and C–S stretching vibrations from DMSO coordinated to Pb 2+
at 1,012 cm −1 ; N–H stretching in the range about 3,200–3,450 cm −1 ; and C–H stretching in the range about 2,800–2,950 cm −1 . The FTIR spectra of MAI, PbI 2 , DMSO–PbI 2 –DMSO, MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO and MAPbI 3
are provided in
Supplementary Fig. 3
for functional group comparison. The detection of both the N–H and S–O deformation modes in the intermediate phase guarantees the successful inclusion of a solvent molecule (DMSO) and MAI into the PbI 2 . Furthermore, the C=C mode indicative of the toluene dripping solvent is not detected.

(haematite, JCPDS file No. 07-0235), MAI, PbI 2 (DMSO) 2
and MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO intermediate phase powders. Comparing the XRD patterns of these powders, it is seen that the intermediate phase is different from the PbI 2 , MAI and PbI 2 (DMSO) 2
phases.

d , Scheme for the formation of the perovskite material via the MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO intermediate phase. (i) PbI 2
consisting of edge-sharing [PbI 6 ] 4− -octahedral layers. (ii) MAI and DMSO guest molecules intercalated between the layers, forming the flat MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO intermediate phase film, when toluene is introduced onto the wet film comprising PbI 2 , MAI and DMSO. Here, the positions of the guest molecules are unconfirmed. (iii) Finally, the intermediate phase film is converted to the perovskite phase with corner-sharing octahedra via the extraction of DMSO guest molecules by the annealing process. The perovskite film is extremely uniform and flat because of the solid-state conversion from the uniform and flat intermediate phase film. Full size image The conversion of the intermediate phase into perovskite with annealing temperature was monitored by
in situ
high-temperature XRD. The low-angle diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern of
Fig. 2c
clearly show that, with increasing temperature, the putative MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO disappears and new peaks are observed due to the appearance of MAPbI 3
perovskite. We see that the formation of the perovskite phase is accompanied by the complete transformation of the MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO at 130 °C, whereas both MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO and perovskite phases coexist at 100 °C. On the basis of the above observations, we propose a plausible mechanism for the formation of the uniform and dense perovskite layer during spin-coating from MAI, PbI 2
and DMSO with a toluene drip treatment. As shown in
Fig. 2d , at the initial stage during spinning, the film is composed of MAI and PbI 2
dissolved in the DMSO/GBL solvent mixture, whereas in the intermediate stage, the composition of the film is concentrated by the evaporation of GBL. Then the toluene droplets lead to the immediate freezing of the constituents on spinning via the quick removal of the excess DMSO solvent and the rapid formation of the MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO phase, leaving a uniform and transparent thin layer ( Supplementary Fig. 1d ). The role of DMSO in the MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO phase is to retard the rapid reaction between PbI 2
and MAI during the evaporation of solvent in the spin-coating process. Finally, the extremely homogeneous flat film (shown in
Fig. 3a ) is converted into a pure crystalline MAPbI 3
perovskite layer after annealing at 100 °C. In this process, the key material is the flat film consisting of MAI–PbI 2 –DMSO. These behaviours do not change by using the mixed-halide materials, MAPb(I 1 −  x Br x ) 3
( x
= 0.1–0.15).

The size of the AFM images is 3 × 3 μm 2 . The measured root mean square roughness is 6.0 nm ( a ) and 8.3 nm ( b ).
c , Higher-magnification SEM image of the upper layer.
d , Cross-sectional SEM image of a complete perovskite device. Full size image Accordingly, the formation of the intermediate phase is a critical factor for smoothing the surface via dropwise toluene application, which finally results in compact and uniform thin layers.
Figure 3
illustrates images obtained by atomic force microscopy (AFM) for the intermediate film and the perovskite film on fused silica substrate, and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the surface of the perovskite upper layer and the cross-section of a representative cell formed by our solvent-engineering technology. As can be seen in the three-dimensional AFM images and topography of
Fig. 3a,b , the root mean square roughness values for the intermediate phase and crystalline perovskite layer are 6.0 and 8.3 nm, respectively, even though the formation of the perovskite from the intermediate layer gave slightly increased roughness. In
Fig. 3c , we can observe that the surface exhibits a dense-grained uniform morphology with grain sizes in the range 100–500 nm. The entire film is composed of a homogeneous, well-crystallized perovskite layer. In addition, from a typical cross-sectional SEM image of a real device, we can see two uniform layers consisting of a TiO 2 /perovskite nanocomposite and the pure perovskite ( Fig. 3d ); the perovskite materials are fully infiltrated into the pores of the mp-TiO 2
film, and also deposited in a very uniform thick film with 100% surface coverage atop the mp-TiO 2 , compared with the conventional method 10 , 11 . To fabricate efficient solar cells, the active layer of the light harvester must be thick enough to absorb sufficient incident light. Fortunately, the high absorption coefficient ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ) of a perovskite light absorber film allows the use of very thin layers ( ∼ 330 nm thick) to absorb the entire range of visible light. Indeed, the authors of ref.
12
fabricated a highly efficient thin solar cell exceeding 15% efficiency with a perovskite absorber (MAPbI 1 −  x Cl x ) of
∼ 300 nm without mp-TiO 2 , and reported that the MAPbI 1 −  x Cl x
perovskite had a long diffusion length (> 1 μm; ref.  17 ). These results encouraged us to fabricate a thin-film solar cell using MAPb(I 1 −  x Br x ) 3
( x  = 0.1–0.15) with a thickness of 350 nm in the absence of mp-TiO 2 . We were able to fabricate thin-film solar cells with extremely uniform, dense layers ( Fig. 3a–c ) by our solvent-engineering technology.
Figure 4a
presents the
I – V
curves for a cell fabricated without the mp-TiO 2
layer, measured with a 40 ms scanning delay in reverse (from the open-circuit voltage ( V oc ) to the short-circuit current ( I sc )) and forward (that is, from
I sc
to
V oc ) modes under standard air-mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5 G) illumination.
Table 1
summarizes the extracted short-circuit current density ( J sc ),
V oc
and fill factor (FF). Apparently, there is a large hysteresis and distortion in the
I – V
curves. The
J sc ,
V oc
and FF values obtained from the
I – V
curve of the reverse scan were 19.2 mA cm −2 , 1.09 V and 0.69, respectively, yielding a PCE of 14.4% under standard AM 1.5 conditions. In contrast, the corresponding values from the
I – V
curve of the forward scan were 19.2 mA cm −2 , 1.07 V and 0.44, respectively, showing a pronounced discrepancy of 9.1% in overall efficiency. Such hysteresis and the discrepancy result in the underestimation of the real
J – V
curves in the forward scan and overestimation in the reverse scan. Typically, reliable solar cell
I–V
measurements should exhibit coincident curves for both the forward and reverse scans. In some cases, depending on the cells, the measurements must be carried out with longer scanning delays. Thus, the efficiencies for the cell without the mp-TiO 2
layer were compared between the forward and reverse scans at various delay times ranging from 10 to 300 ms. As can be seen in
Supplementary Fig. 5a
the efficiency decreased from 11.0 to 7.0% in the forward scan and from 16.5 to 8.5% in the reverse scan, as the delay time increased from 10 to 300 ms. The efficiencies did not approach similar values even when the scan time was long. Furthermore, the average efficiency from the reverse and forward scans continued to decline with increasing delay time. Thus, the large discrepancy and discordance with scan direction and delay time can induce a considerable error in evaluating cell efficiency. In contrast, the
J – V
curves of the forward and reverse scans of the cell with the bilayer architecture {FTO/blocking layer (bl)-TiO 2 /mp-TiO 2
( ∼ 200 nm)/upper layer ( ∼ 200 nm)/PTAA (50 nm)/Au} ( Fig. 4b ) were well coincident. Moreover, the efficiency and average efficiency from both scan directions were symmetrical and identical regardless of the scanning direction, and results using a significantly shorter delay time were coincident with those from a cell lacking the mp-TiO 2
( Supplementary Fig. 5b ). The
J sc ,
V oc
and FF values obtained from the
I – V
curves of
Fig. 4b
for the reverse and forward scans are summarized in
Table 1 , and the overall efficiencies for both scan directions under the standard method are 15.8 and 15.9% with an average of 15.85%, clearly showing the reliability of the
I–V
measurements. Generally, the average value of the efficiency, determined from the forward and reverse scans should be widely accepted when the scanning delay time is longer than 40 ms (ref.  23 ), because an excessively long time to complete the measurement is impractical. Figure 4: Photovoltaic performance as a function of scan direction and mp-TiO 2

curves for a flat cell (FTO/bl-TiO 2 /350-nm-thick perovskite layer/PTAA/Au) measured by forward (short circuit → open circuit) and reverse (open circuit → short circuit) scans with 10 mV voltage steps and 40 ms delay times under AM 1.5 G illumination.

c , Relationship between the power-conversion efficiency of the perovskite cells versus the thickness of the mp-TiO 2
layer. For each thickness, 12 cells were characterized. The error bars represent maximum and minimum efficiency values (vertical) and thickness values (horizontal; thickness calculated from SEM cross-sections). Full size image Table 1 Photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells without mp-TiO 2
or with 200-nm-thick mp-TiO 2 . Full size table For a deeper understanding of the dependence of the
I – V
parameters on both scan directions, we investigated the difference between the forward and reverse scans for a 40 ms scan time as a function of the thickness of the mp-TiO 2
layer. As the layer thickness increased to ~200 nm, the difference in efficiency between the forward and reverse scans reached a minimum, and then again deviated slightly with continuing mp-TiO 2
thickness increases ( Fig. 4c ). Interestingly, the efficiency measured in the reverse scan did not vary greatly with the mp-TiO 2
thickness, whereas the forward scan yielded a pronounced variation, resulting in a large discrepancy between the two scan directions. Such a strong dependence of the measured efficiency on the scan direction with mp-TiO 2
thickness suggests that solar cells fabricated from MAPbX 3
perovskite materials operate differently than other types of cells such as organic, dye-sensitized, and conventional Si solar cells. The stepwise increase or decrease in the bias voltage, corresponding to a reverse or forward scan, respectively, requires a charge redistribution to reach a new equilibrium state. These characteristics of perovskite solar cells may be related to the large diffusion capacitance of such cells operating under reverse or forward biases 24 . The large capacitance is assumed to be related to the underestimation in the forward scan and overestimation in the reverse scan by charging and discharging during the voltage sweep in the solar cells. In other words, the generated charge (electrons or holes) may persist in the perovskite owing to the slow charge collection in the thick perovskite layer, and require significant time for charge distribution. This would impede a quick response to the rapid scanning of the applied voltage for the
I – V
measurements. Therefore, the slow charge collection via the perovskite material itself must be improved to eliminate the large discrepancy with scan direction, and an optimally thick mp-TiO 2
layer must be introduced for efficient charge collection from the perovskite via the large TiO 2
interface. Eventually, it will be very important to impart effective charge collection and light absorption properties through a balance in the ratios between the perovskite-infiltrated TiO 2
layer and the thin upper layers. Of course, the tendency for discrepancy according to scan direction can be related to the perovskite composition, because the exciton diffusion length was markedly changed by doping Cl ions into MAPbI 3
(ref.  17 ). To further enhance the performance of our cells fabricated by solvent engineering, we repeated the fabrication procedure using mp-TiO 2
with a thickness of
∼ 200 nm. The
J – V
curves and incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectrum of the best performing solar cell are presented in
Fig. 5 . The average values from the
J – V
curves from the reverse and forward scans ( Fig. 5a ) exhibited a
J sc
of 19.58 mA cm −2 ,
V oc
of 1.105 V, and FF of 76.2%, corresponding to a PCE of 16.5% under standard AM 1.5 G conditions. The best device also showed a very broad IPCE plateau of over 80% between 420 and 700 nm, as shown in
Fig. 5b . The
J sc
value integrated from the IPCE agreed well with that measured by
I – V . In
Fig. 5c
a histogram of the average PCEs for all of the independently fabricated cells contributing to our study is presented. Around 80% of the cells made using our process exhibited an overall efficiency exceeding of 15% under 1 sun conditions, proving the conceptual validity of a balanced thickness between the TiO 2
and thin upper layers. In addition, an evaluation of the available results allows us to conclude that this solvent-engineering approach provides a simple and effective means for realizing high-efficiency and low-cost perovskite-based solar cells. One of these devices was certified by the standardized method in a photovoltaics calibration laboratory, confirming a PCE of 16.2% under AM 1.5 G full sun ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ). Figure 5:

Full size image In summary, we developed a solvent-engineering technology for the deposition of extremely uniform perovskite layers, and demonstrated a solution-processed perovskite solar cell with 16.5% PCE under standard conditions (AM 1.5 G radiation, 100 mW cm −2 ). We proposed a plausible mechanism for the formation of uniform and dense perovskite layers during the solvent-engineering process. The formation of a stable MAI(Br)–PbI 2 –DMSO phase via an intercalation process during the dropwise application of a non-dissolving solvent was a decisive factor in retarding the rapid reaction between MAI(Br) and PbI(Br) 2 , which enabled the formation of a highly uniform and dense surface. Furthermore, we found that thick perovskite cells fabricated without mp-TiO 2
showed a large hysteresis and distortion between reverse and forward scans, and raised arguments about the estimation of conversion efficiencies for perovskite cells. Hence, the ratio of the thicknesses of the perovskite-infiltrated mp-TiO 2
and the pure perovskite should be optimized to fabricate efficient perovskite cells with coincident reverse and forward scans. These results will provide an effective strategy for forming uniform PbI 2 -based perovskite layers through intercalation, and lead to more efficient and cost-effective inorganic–organic hybrid heterojunction solar cells in the future. Methods Solar cell fabrication. A dense blocking layer of TiO 2
(bl-TiO 2 ,
∼ 70 nm in thickness) was deposited onto a F-doped SnO 2
(FTO, Pilkington, TEC8) substrate by spray pyrolysis, using a 20 mM titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution (Aldrich) at 450 °C to prevent direct contact between the FTO and the hole-conducting layer. A 200–300-nm-thick mesoporous TiO 2
(particle size: about 50 nm, crystalline phase: anatase) film was spin-coated onto the bl-TiO 2 /FTO substrate using home-made pastes 14
and calcining at 500 °C for 1 h in air to remove organic components. CH 3 NH 3 I (MAI) and CH 3 NH 3 Br (MABr) were first synthesized by reacting 27.86 ml CH 3 NH 2
(40% in methanol, Junsei Chemical) and 30 ml HI (57 wt% in water, Aldrich) or 44 ml HBr (48 wt% in water, Aldrich) in a 250 ml round-bottom flask at 0 °C for 4 h with stirring, respectively. The precipitate was recovered by evaporation at 55 °C for 1 h. MAI and MABr were dissolved in ethanol, recrystallized from diethyl ether, and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h. The prepared MAI and MABr powders, PbI 2
(Aldrich) and PbBr 2
(Aldrich) for 0.8 M MAPb(I 1 −  x Br x ) 3
( x
= 0.1–0.15) solution were stirred in a mixture of GBL and DMSO (7:3 v/v) at 60 °C for 12 h. The resulting solution was coated onto the mp-TiO 2 /bl-TiO 2 /FTO substrate by a consecutive two-step spin-coating process at 1,000 and 5,000 r.p.m for 10 and 20 s, respectively. During the second spin-coating step, the substrate (around 1 cm × 1 cm) was treated with toluene drop-casting. A detailed time-rotation profile for the spin-coating is represented in
Supplementary Fig. 1c . The substrate was dried on a hot plate at 100 °C for 10 min. A solution of poly(triarylamine) (15 mg, PTAA, EM Index,
M w
= 17,500 g mol −1 ) in toluene (1.5 ml) was mixed with 15 μl of a solution of lithium bistrifluoromethanesulphonimidate (170 mg) in acetonitrile (1 ml) and 7.5 μl 4- tert -butylpyridine and spin-coated on the MAPb(I 1 −  x Br x ) 3
( x
= 0.1–0.15)/mp-TiO 2 /bl-TiO 2 /FTO substrate at 3,000 r.p.m for 30 s. Finally, a Au counterelectrode was deposited by thermal evaporation. The active area of this electrode was fixed at 0.16 cm 2 . Characterization. The XRD spectra of the prepared films were measured using a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer, and
in situ
XRD experiments of the powder isolated as an intermediate phase were performed using a Rigaku Ultima IV with an X-ray tube (Cu Kα,
λ
= 1.5406 Å). The elemental analysis (C, H, N and S) of the complex was performed using a FISONS EA–1108 CHN analyser. The FTIR spectra (4,000–500 cm −1 ) were recorded on a Bruker EQUINOX 55 spectrophotometer with samples prepared by the KBr pellet method. Ultraviolet–visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV 2550 spectrophotometer in the 200–800 nm wavelength range at room temperature. AFM was performed using Bruker multimode 8 in ‘tapping’ mode. The IPCE was measured using a power source (Newport 300 W xenon lamp, 66920) with a monochromator (Newport Cornerstone 260) and a multimeter (Keithley 2001).
J – V
curves were measured using a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Class A, 91195A) with a source meter (Keithley 2420) at 100 mW cm −2 , AM 1.5 G illumination, and a calibrated Si-reference cell certified by the NREL. The
J – V
curves were measured by reverse (forward bias (1.2 V) → short circuit (0 V)) or forward (short circuit (0 V) → forward bias (1.2 V)) scan. The step voltage was fixed at 10 mV and the delay time, which is a set delay at each voltage step before measuring each current, was modulated.
J – V
curves for all devices were measured by masking the active area with a metal mask 0.094 cm −2
in area.

Abstract
Perovskite-based solar cells have attracted significant recent interest, with power conversion efficiencies in excess of 15% already superceding a number of established thin-film solar cell technologies. Most work has focused on a methylammonium lead trihalide perovskites, with a bandgaps of ∼1.55 eV and greater. Here, we explore the effect of replacing the methylammonium cation in this perovskite, and show that with the slightly larger formamidinium cation, we can synthesise formamidinium lead trihalide perovskites with a bandgap tunable between 1.48 and 2.23 eV. We take the 1.48 eV-bandgap perovskite as most suited for single junction solar cells, and demonstrate long-range electron and hole diffusion lengths in this material, making it suitable for planar heterojunction solar cells. We fabricate such devices, and due to the reduced bandgap we achieve high short-circuit currents of >23 mA cm −2 , resulting in power conversion efficiencies of up to 14.2%, the highest efficiency yet for solution processed planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells. Formamidinium lead triiodide is hence promising as a new candidate for this class of solar cell.

Abstract Thin-film photovoltaics play an important role in the quest for clean renewable energy. Recently, methylammonium lead halide perovskites were identified as promising absorbers for solar cells 1 . In the three years since, the performance of perovskite-based solar cells has improved rapidly to reach efficiencies as high as 15% 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 . To date, all high-efficiency perovskite solar cells reported make use of a (mesoscopic) metal oxide, such as Al 2 O 3 , TiO 2
or ZrO 2 , which requires a high-temperature sintering process. Here, we show that methylammonium lead iodide perovskite layers, when sandwiched between two thin organic charge-transporting layers, also lead to solar cells with high power-conversion efficiencies (12%). To ensure a high purity, the perovskite layers were prepared by sublimation in a high-vacuum chamber. This simple planar device structure and the room-temperature deposition processes are suitable for many conducting substrates, including plastic and textiles.

Main The hybrid organic–inorganic methylammonium lead halide perovskites, pioneered by Mitzi, are recognized for their excellent semiconducting properties 11 , 12 . Following the pioneering work of Miyasaka and co-workers 1 , the ease with which these organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials can be prepared and processed from solution makes them attractive for photovoltaic applications 13 . In their studies, the methylammonium lead iodide perovskite was used as a sensitizer in liquid dye-sensitized solar cells and an efficiency of 3.8% was obtained. The low efficiency results from the solubility of the perovskite layer in the iodine/iodide redox electrolyte system. High efficiencies have been realized by replacing the liquid electrolyte with a solid hole-transporting material such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis( N , N -di- p -methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD), as reported by the groups of Snaith and Graetzel 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 . Interestingly, Lee
et al. 6
showed that a mixed-halide perovskite on a mesoporous Al 2 O 3
photoanode acts both as a light absorber and an electron conductor. Etgar
et al. 8
reported that the pure methylammonium lead iodide perovskite also acts as an efficient hole conductor. Recently, Burschka
et al. 4
published a high power-conversion efficiency of 15% for a solar cell in which the perovskite was deposited by a novel sequential deposition technique on a mesoporous TiO 2
film. Ball
et al. 5
showed that a thick layer (350 nm) of the mixed-halide methylammonium lead perovskite (CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3− x Cl x ) leads to efficient solar cells (12%). They argue that the perovskite functions as the absorber and as the electron and hole transporter. Additionally, it was suggested that the excitons dissociate predominantly in the bulk and not at a donor–acceptor interface. The operating mechanism of planar perovskite solar cells, however, is not clear. For example, it was shown that the photoluminescence of a mixed-halide methylammonium lead perovskite was reduced strongly when either a hole- or an electron-transporting layer was deposited on top of it 14 . A similar effect, but less strong, was observed for thin films of the pure iodide methylammonium lead perovskite 14 . Hence, exciton dissociation may occur both in the bulk and at the perovskite interface. Currently, the dominant process is not established and may well depend on the exact nature of the perovskite film. Up to now, the highest efficiency was reported by Liu
et al. , who used a thin metal oxide layer and a sublimed perovskite layer that leads to solar cells with an efficiency of 15.4% 9 . High material purity is essential for efficient charge-carrier transport and to prevent exciton quenching, as established in organic light-emitting diodes and organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices 15 , 16 . Therefore, in these devices vacuum sublimation is employed frequently to achieve high-purity layers. Solution-processed perovskites are generated
in situ
and therefore may contain imperfections and impurities. Purification of the perovskite layer is not possible as it decomposes on dissolving. An inverted layout, similar to that employed in small molecular weight and polymeric solar cells, has also been described 17 , 18 . In these bilayer planar heterojunction devices, the perovskite layer was used as the electron donor in combination with an electron acceptor, in analogy to a frequently used OPV layout. The holes are extracted via the transparent conductor poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS). The device performances, however, were significantly inferior to those of devices that employ (mesoporous) metal oxides. Here, we present an inverted thin-film solar cell based on a sublimed methylammonium lead iodide perovskite layer sandwiched between two very thin electron- and hole-blocking layers that consist of organic molecules. The organic materials were deposited using solution-based processes, whereas the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
perovskite and the metal contact were deposited using thermal evaporation under vacuum. These simple devices, free of metal oxide and prepared using room-temperature processing, reach efficiencies as high as 12% at 100 mW cm −2 , which demonstrate their potential for a wide variety of photovoltaic applications. The CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
perovskite thin film was prepared by coevaporation of the two starting compounds, CH 3 NH 3 I and PbI 2 . Details of the experimental conditions are given in the Methods section. These films were characterized using grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD). Initially, excess PbI 2
was present in the film, yet on optimizing the evaporation process, highly oriented pure CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
films were obtained (see
Fig 1a
and
Supplementary Fig. 1 ). The films adopt the typical tetragonal structure for CH 3 NH 3 MX 3
hybrid perovskites (M = Pb, Sn; X = Cl, Br, I) formed by a three-dimensional anionic framework of PbI 6
octahedra with the methylammonium cations in the interstitial space (see
Fig. 1b ) 19 . The roughness of the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
film was evaluated using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and an image of a typical scan is given in
Fig. 1d , which demonstrates a smooth film with a root mean square roughness of 5 nm.

d , AFM image and profile of a 60-nm-thick film. Full size image As the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
layer is prepared via vacuum sublimation, it can be implemented easily in different device architectures. To demonstrate that the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
is capable of performing most of the roles required to obtain an efficient solar cell and to minimize the use of costly organic semiconductors, a simple device structure was chosen. In this structure, which is typical for both organic photovoltaic and light-emitting devices, a semitransparent organic conductor was used as the positive charge-collecting contact. The structure of the device is shown in
Fig. 2a , and consists of a 70 nm PEDOT:PSS layer and a thin layer (<10 nm) of poly( N , N′ -bis(4-butylphenyl)- N , N ′-bis(phenyl)benzidine) (polyTPD) ( Fig. 2c ) as the electron-blocking layer. On top of this, the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
was evaporated thermally to a thickness of 285 nm followed by a thin layer (<10 nm) of (6,6)-phenyl C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the hole-blocking layer ( Fig. 2d ) 20 . The device was completed by the evaporation of an Au top electrode (100 nm). Both the polyTPD and the PCBM layers were deposited using a meniscus-coating process to ensure high-quality films 21 . The thickness of the layers was established using absorbance measurements. Figure 2: Schematics of the device. a , Stacked layer structure.
b , Schematic of the relative energy levels of each layer.
c , Chemical structure of the polyarylamine (polyTPD).
d , Chemical structure of PCBM. Full size image The relevant energy levels of the materials used to prepare the solar cell are depicted in
Fig. 2b . The valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) of the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
perovskite are −5.4 and −3.9 eV, versus vacuum, respectively 7 . On illuminating the device, excitons are generated in the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
perovskite layer. It was reported that excitons in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
perovskites are of the Wannier–Mott type, which implies that they may dissociate in the bulk of the perovskite layer 5 , 12 . Owing to the use of indium–tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS as the hole-collecting contact and Au as the electron-collecting electrode, the built-in voltage of this device is small. Hence, to direct the flow of electrons and holes, thin hole-blocking and electron-blocking layers are incorporated adjacent to the perovskite layer. PolyTPD and PCBM were selected for this role as their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels, respectively, match well with the VB and CB of the perovskite, which allows for a good transport of holes towards the polyTPD and of electrons to the PCBM layer ( Fig. 2b ). As the LUMO of polyTPD is significantly closer to vacuum compared with that of the perovskite CB, polyTPD efficiently blocks the flow of electrons. The opposite process, the blocking of holes, occurs at the perovskite–PCBM interface because of the lower HOMO of PCBM compared with that of the perovskite VB. As mentioned above, exciton dissociation may also occur at the perovskite–polyTPD and perovskite–PCBM interfaces 14 . Figure 3a
shows the current–voltage ( J–V ) characteristics of a typical small-area (0.09 cm 2 ) perovskite solar cell measured in the dark and under light intensities of 100, 50 and 10 mW cm −2 . The reproducibility from device to device was excellent, with less than 10% deviation. The short-circuit current density ( J SC ), open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) and fill factor ( FF ), respectively, are 16.12 mA cm −2 , 1.05 V and 0.67, which lead to a power-conversion efficiency of 12.04% measured at 100 mW cm −2 . At 50 and 10 mW cm −2
the device exhibited very similar efficiencies, 12.04% and 12.00%, respectively. The high open-circuit potential indicates that there are negligible surface and sub-bandgap states in the perovskite film. The device performance under 100 mW cm −2
is remarkable in view of the very thin perovskite film of 285 nm. A device with cells of larger area (0.98 cm 2 ) was also prepared and evaluated at 100 mW cm −2
( Supplementary Fig. 4 ). The
J SC
and
V OC
are very similar to the data obtained for the small-area cell (14.76 mA cm −2
and 1.05 V, respectively). The
FF , however, is significantly lower (0.52), which is the main reason for the lower power-conversion efficiency (8.27%) for these larger cells. Figure 3: Typical
J – V
and IPCE characteristics of the perovskite solar cell. a , Photocurrent density versus voltage at 100, 50 and 10 mW cm −2
and in the dark.
b , IPCE spectrum and absorbance of a 285-nm-thick perovskite layer. Full size image The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra exhibit 74% ( Fig. 3b ) where the generation of photocurrent started at 790 nm, in agreement with the bandgap of the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 . It is interesting that the IPCE spectra show a very steep onset, contrary to the IPCE spectra reported for TiO 2
and Al 2 O 3
mesoscopic-based perovskite cells. A very similar IPCE spectrum as observed for our solar cells was reported for a solar cell based on a perovskite layer sandwiched between a C 60 -modified TiO 2
layer and a layer of poly(3-hexylthiophene) 22 . As such, the steep onset may be related to the specific interaction of the perovskite with the fullerene molecules. The IPCE spectrum is almost flat, except for a dip at 630 nm that could result from the oxidized polyTPD acting as a filter or from reduced absorption of the perovskite. Integrating the overlap of the IPCE spectrum with the AM1.5G solar photon flux yields a current density of 16.40 mA cm −2 , which is in excellent agreement with the measured photocurrent density of 16.12 mA cm −2
at the standard solar AM1.5G intensity of 100 mW cm −2 , which confirms that the mismatch between the simulated sunlight and the AM1.5G standard is negligible. The absorbance of the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
film is similar to those reported previously for this material and increases with increasing layer thickness ( Fig. 3b ). The absorption extends over the complete visible spectrum up to 800 nm, with a local maximum around 500 nm (the scale of the graph in
Fig. 3b
is optical density). Conclusion An efficient solid-state, thin-film solar cell was obtained by sandwiching a sublimated CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
perovskite layer between two thin organic charge-transporting layers that function as hole and electron blockers, respectively, and contacting it via an indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS as the hole-extraction and an Au electron-extraction contact. The simple device architecture, which is an
n -type oxide and scaffold free, coupled with easy room-temperature fabrication using economically favourable materials, high efficiency and high reproducibility rivals strongly the established thin-film photovoltaic technologies. The device power-conversion efficiency of 12% at 100 mW cm −2
is remarkable in view of the very thin (285 nm) perovskite film. The high
J sc
of 16.12 mA cm −2
and the open-circuit potential of 1.05 V reveal that very few electrons and holes recombine, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the hole- and electron-blocking layers. We believe that this new class of perovskite solar cell using organic semiconductors to collect the charges will find widespread applications to rival photovoltaic solar cells based on thin films.

4 , 2761 (2013). Methods Materials Photolithographically patterned ITO-covered glass substrates were purchased from NaranjoSubstrates. Aqueous dispersions of PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP Al 4083) were obtained from Heraeus Holding and used as received. Poly-TPD was purchased from ADS Dyesource. PbI 2
was purchased from Aldrich and used as is. CH 3 NH 3 I was prepared similarly to a previously published method 8 ; in brief, CH 3 NH 3 I was synthesized by reacting 21.6 ml methylamine (40 wt% in water; Aldrich) and 30 ml hydroiodic acid (57 wt% in water; Aldrich) in a 250 ml round-bottomed flask at 0 °C for 2 h with stirring. The white precipitate was recovered by evaporation at 50 °C for 1 h. The product, CH 3 NH 3 I, was dissolved in ethanol, filtered, recrystallized from diethyl ether and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h. Device preparation Devices were prepared on cleaned ITO substrates by spin coating a thin layer of PEDOT:PSS from the commercial aqueous dispersion (1,200 revolutions per minute for 30 s (Chemmat, 3 cm diameter), which resulted in a thickness of 70 nm). On top of this layer a thin film of polyTPD was deposited from a chlorobenzene solution (10 mg ml −1 ) using a meniscus coater and a coating speed of 2.5 mm s −1 . Then the substrates were transferred to a vacuum chamber integrated into an inert glovebox (<0.1 ppm O 2
and <0.1 ppm H 2 O; MBraun) and evacuated to a pressure of 1 × 10 −6  mbar. Two ceramic crucibles were filled with CH 3 NH 3 I (freshly prepared) and PbI 2 , which were heated to 70 °C and 250 °C, respectively. The film thickness was controlled by the PbI 2
evaporation at a rate of evaporation of 0.5 Å s −1
(see
Supplementary Information
for more details concerning the perovskite evaporation process). The PCBM layer was deposited using a chlorobenzene solution (10 mg ml −1 ) in ambient conditions with a meniscus coater and a coating speed of 10 mm s −1 . The device was completed by the thermal evaporation of the top metal electrode under a base pressure of 2 × 10 −6  mbar to a thickness of 100 nm. The solar cells (active area of 0.09 and 0.98 cm 2 ) were then encapsulated with a glass cover using an ultraviolet-curable epoxy sealant (Ossila E131 Encapsulation Epoxy), with an ultraviolet exposure of 5 min. Characterization GIXRD data were collected at room temperature in the 2 θ
range 5–50° on an Empyrean PANalytical powder diffractometer using Cu Kα 1
radiation. Typically, four repeated measurements were collected and merged into a single diffractogram. Pawley refinements 23
were performed using the TOPAS computer program 24
and revealed an excellent fit to a one-phase model with a tetragonal cell ( a  = 8.80(2),
c  = 12.57(2) Å) and space group
I 4/ mcm . Additional peaks that correspond to the ITO substrate were also observed. The observed and calculated diffraction patterns for the refined crystal structures are shown in
Supplementary Fig. 3 . Simulation of the crystal structure of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
perovskite was performed using, as a starting model, the isostructural Sn analogue (CCDC ref. code: ZZZBWS02), and modifying the cell parameters to those obtained in the Pawley refinement 25 . Absorption spectra were taken using a fibre-optics based Aventes Avaspec2048 spectrometer. Current–voltage characteristics were recorded by applying an external potential bias to the cell and recording the generated photocurrent with a digital source meter (Keithley Model 2400). The light source was a 450 W xenon lamp (Oriel) equipped with a Schott K113 Tempax sunlight filter (Praezisions Glas & Optik) to match the emission spectrum of the lamp to the AM1.5G standard. A black mask was used in the photovoltaic studies to limit the active area of the device. Before each measurement, the exact light intensity was determined using a calibrated Si reference diode equipped with an infrared cut-off filter (KG-3, Schott). IPCE measurements were determined using a 300 W xenon light source (ILC Technology). A Gemini-180 double monochromator (Jobin Yvon) was used to select and increment the wavelength of the radiation that impinged on the cells. The monochromatic incident light was passed through a chopper run at 1 Hz frequency, and the on/off ratio was measured by an operational amplifier. IPCE spectra were recorded as functions of wavelength under a constant white-light bias of approximately 5 mW cm −2
supplied by an array of diodes that emitted white light. The excitation beam from a 300 W xenon lamp (ILC Technology) was focused through a Gemini-180 double monochromator (Jobin Yvon) and chopped at approximately 2 Hz. The signal was recorded using a Model SR830 DSP Lock-In Amplifier (Stanford Research Systems).

Abstract
As a coating method compatible with printing, one-step spin-coating is widely used for fabricating perovskite thin films. Controlling the crystal growth rate of two precursors is essential to obtain a homogeneous film morphology. However, the film formation mechanism and role of solvate systems during spin-coating have not yet been clearly revealed. In this work, we implemented the
in situ
grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
perovskite material based on various additive systems to adjust the unbalanced crystal growth rate of CH 3 NH 3 I and PbI 2 . As we expected, the behavior of the solvate phase was strikingly mediated by various additives, and one of the additives greatly slowed the PbI 2
solvate phase, thus overcoming the imbalance in the crystal growth rate. Consequently, the well-controlled perovskite films have both good film morphology and high photovoltaic performance with excellent reproducibility.

We show that the recombination energy of the direct band gap photoluminescence (PL) of germanium can be controlled by an external mechanical stress. The stress is provided by an apparatus commonly used for bulge or blister test. An energy redshift up to 60 meV is demonstrated for the room temperature PL of a thin germanium membrane (125 nm wavelength shift from 1535 to 1660 nm). This PL shift is correlated with the in-plane tensile strain generated in the film. A biaxial tensile strain larger than 0.6% is achieved by this method. This mechanical strain allows to approach the direct band gap condition for germanium which is of tremendous importance to achieve lasing with this material.

Germanium is attracting a considerable interest due to the possibility to achieve laser emission with this material on a silicon platform. Optical gain has been recently reported in a thin germanium film deposited on a silicon wafer. 1
Two main ingredients are at the origin of the enhancement of the optical recombination properties of germanium:
n -type doping and tensile strain.
n -type doping allows to fill with carriers the indirect
L
valley and increase the number of carriers transferred into the
Γ
valley where they can recombine efficiently. The enhancement by
n -doping of the direct band gap room temperature photoluminescence (PL) of germanium has been demonstrated for germanium on silicon 2
and for germanium-on-insulator layers. 3
The second main ingredient to tailor the germanium optical properties is the in-plane tensile strain. Due to the difference of deformation potential parameters between the
Γ
and
L
valleys, a biaxial tensile strain leads to a stronger dependence with strain of the energy position of the
Γ
valley as compared to the
L
valley. It has been theoretically shown that germanium can even become a direct band gap material for a 2% tensile strain. 4,5
Strong optical gain in tensilely strained germanium has been theoretically predicted either using effective mass approaches 6–8
or 30 band
k ⋅ p
formalism. 9
The application of a tensile strain can be obtained by several techniques. A small tensile strain of 0.25% can be obtained by directly depositing relaxed germanium on silicon and taking advantage of the difference of thermal mismatch coefficients between germanium and silicon. 10
Tensilely-strained germanium can also be obtained by growing germanium on materials with a larger lattice parameter like InGaAs buffers. 11
A third option is to apply a mechanical external tensile stress to generate the required strain. This approach offers the advantage to control the amplitude of the deformation and consequently the possibility to tailor the optical properties
ex situ . Micromechanical strain engineering has been theoretically considered in Ref.
8 . In order to present an interest in the framework of optical gain studies on germanium, the applied tensile strain needs to be large enough, i.e., a fraction of percent, in order to have a significant impact on the
L - Γ
valley splitting and on the degeneracy lifting of the valence band.
In this letter, we report on the external control of the optical properties of germanium through a mechanical deformation. The mechanical deformation is provided by a bulge/blister test apparatus normally used to characterize mechanical properties and adhesion of thin films. A biaxial tensile strain larger than 0.6% has been achieved in a thin germanium membrane. The strain is measured through the vertical displacement of the germanium membrane combined with the modeling of the strain profile. This strain leads to a significant change of the room temperature direct band gap recombination of germanium. A spectral shift as large as 60 meV (125 nm) is observed at room temperature on the PL spectra. We show that in this regime the PL is still dominated by the recombination with the heavy holes. The wavelength shift is correlated with the predicted band gap shift as obtained from a 30 band
k ⋅ p
formalism. 12–15
An excellent agreement is obtained between the experimental band gap shift and the theoretical one.
The principle of operation of the bulge test is shown in Fig.
1 . A germanium membrane is glued on a metal piece with a drilled circular aperture. The germanium membrane was obtained after chemical etching of a bulk Ge substrate using a
HF – H 2 O 2 – H 2 O
(1-1-1) solution. A uniform water pressure can be applied through the hole of the sample holder to the back side of the Ge membrane by a manual piston or a syringe pump. 16,17
The pressure is measured by a diaphragm pressure sensor. The applied pressure is eventually limited by the debonding of the sample from the metallic support or by sample breaking. The vertical displacement at the center is measured
in situ
by focus deflection with a micro-PL set-up by using the reflection of the optical pump. While the pressure is applied, the PL of the germanium film is measured at room temperature using an argon ion laser as the excitation source. The PL is detected with a liquid-nitrogen cooled germanium photodetector and the spectra have been normalized by the photodetector response. Figure
1
also shows the calculated deformed shape of a germanium membrane by applying a 2.5 MPa pressure. The calculation was performed by using a finite element solver. The displacement is maximum at the center of the pressurized membrane. Knowing the thickness of the membrane, its radius, its center deflection, we can deduce the in-plane strain imposed on the material as a function of the external pressure. The calculation indicates that the strain in the membrane is nonuniform with a biaxial in-plane tensile strain in the top center area and a uniaxial compressive strain at the clamped edges of the membrane. The latter can be significantly larger than the one at the center.

Figure
2
shows the measured vertical displacement at the center of the membrane as a function of the load pressure. The film has a thickness of
28   μ m
and the vertical displacement can be larger than its thickness. This measurement is compared with the calculated displacement versus load pressure as obtained with a finite element solver. The diameter of the membrane is 1.45 mm. The bulk germanium parameters have been used in the calculation: average Young’s modulus
E = 116   GPa ⁠ , Poisson ration
ν = 0.26 ⁠ . 18
For weak strains, a standard deformation calculation shows that the vertical displacement
y
is equal to
3 ( 1 − ν 2 ) P a 4 / 16 E h 3
where
a
is the radius of the free surface,
h
the thickness of the film, and P the applied pressure while the in-plane biaxial strain at the center of the membrane is equal to
3 ( 1 − ν 2 ) h 2 P / 8 E a 2 ⁠ . 19
These formula indicate that the deformation and the displacement are very sensitive to the radius and to the thickness of the membrane. For large strains, the calculation of the vertical displacement as obtained from the finite element solver accounts for the cap geometry, leading to a nonlinear dependence of the vertical displacement as a function of load pressure. The nonlinearities of the stress-strain behavior of the material are also taken into account through the elastoplastic deformation. The accounting of these nonlinearities is justified by the fact that the high pressure measurements are close to the sample fracture. The dashed lines in Fig.
2
correspond to the calculation with a linear dependence versus pressure while the full lines correspond to the results obtained by simulation with the nonlinear solver. A good agreement is obtained between the measurement of the vertical displacement and the calculation using the nonlinear model. As mentioned above, one can also deduce from the calculation the in-plane tensile strain in the top region of the membrane. The calculated in-plane tensile strain is shown in Fig.
2
(right scale) as a function of the load pressure. As seen, a biaxial tensile strain larger than 0.6% is reached for a load pressure of 3.5 MPa.

Figure
3
shows the room temperature PL spectra of germanium for different load pressures. The PL significantly shifts toward long wavelength as the pressure is increased. The redshift reaches the value of 60 meV (125 nm) for a load pressure of 3.5 MPa. In-plane tensile strain has two main effects on the germanium band structure. It decreases the energy of the
Γ
valley and lifts the degeneracy between heavy holes and light holes in the valence band. The extremum of the valence band is thus theoretically given by the light hole band. However, heavy hole and light hole bands have different effective masses of density of states and different dipole matrix elements. Even if the extremum is given by the light hole band, the calculation of the recombination spectrum shows that the PL is dominated by the recombination with heavy holes for moderate tensile strains. The inset of Fig.
3
shows a calculated recombination spectrum for a tensile strain of 0.7% where the contribution of light hole bands and heavy hole bands are distinguished. As seen, the PL is still dominated by the recombination with the heavy holes. It implies that the wavelength shift observed in Fig.
3
is related to the recombination between the
Γ
valley and the heavy hole band. This point is of importance since the dependence of the band gap implying heavy holes and light holes is significantly different. We have also checked that the wavelength shift is nonuniform along a diameter of the membrane as predicted by the calculation presented in Fig.
1 . The wavelength shift decreases as we move away from the center of the hole and even changes its sign at the edge where a blueshift of the PL is observed.

Figure
4
shows the dependence of the PL maximum as a function of the in-plane biaxial strain. A quasi-linear dependence is reported. This dependence is compared with the calculated dependence of the PL maximum involving the
Γ
band and the heavy or light hole bands as deduced from the calculated band structure using a 30 band
k ⋅ p
formalism. 9
This PL energy variation results from the dependence of the energy positions of the bands as a function of hydrostatic and uniaxial strains. The temperature of the sample deduced from the energy position of the PL maximum at zero applied pressure and which accounts for the heating due to the optical pump is 320 K. The PL shift for the
Γ -heavy hole band can be expressed by the effective following relation obtained from the 30 band
k ⋅ p
formalism
Δ E PL = − 7.8 ε ∥   ( eV )
where
ε ∥ = ε x x = ε y y
is the biaxial in-plane strain. As seen in Fig.
4 , the slope is much larger for the light holes. A very good agreement is obtained between the experimental dependence of the PL energy and the calculated one. It indicates that the spectral shift can unambiguously be attributed to the in-plane strain of the germanium film and to the recombination between
Γ
and heavy hole band. It also demonstrates that an external mechanical stress is very effective to tailor the optical properties of germanium, in agreement with previous theoretical studies. Meanwhile, the possibility to control tensile strain in germanium with a large amplitude represents a significant step to achieve large optical gains in this material and opens promising perspectives for light-emitting devices and high performance lasers using germanium on a silicon platform. 20–22
For that purpose, the resonators could be provided by standard waveguides with cleaved facets or photonic crystal cavities. 23,24

Abstract The black phase of formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI 3 ) perovskite shows huge promise as an efficient photovoltaic, but it is not favoured energetically at room temperature, meaning that the undesirable yellow phases are always present alongside it during crystallization 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . This problem has made it difficult to formulate the fast crystallization process of perovskite and develop guidelines governing the formation of black-phase FAPbI 3
(refs.
5 , 6 ). Here we use in situ monitoring of the perovskite crystallization process to report an oriented nucleation mechanism that can help to avoid the presence of undesirable phases and improve the performance of photovoltaic devices in different film-processing scenarios. The resulting device has a demonstrated power-conversion efficiency of 25.4% (certified 25.0%) and the module, which has an area of 27.83 cm 2 , has achieved an impressive certified aperture efficiency of 21.4%.

Main FAPbI 3
has an impressive bandgap and thermal resistance, and has therefore emerged as the most promising candidate perovskite for use as a photovoltaic device 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 8 . However, the photoactive black phase of FAPbI 3
is not energetically favoured at room temperature 4 , 9 , 10 . Polytype formation and the presence of other intermediate non-photoactive phases can readily occur, which undermines its photovoltaic performance. Several approaches have been developed to promote the formation of black-phase FAPbI 3
at room temperature, such as adduct formation with PbI 2
and solvent engineering using ionic liquids 11 , 12 . Unfortunately, the fast crystallization kinetics of FAPbI 3
perovskites precludes in-depth investigations of its film-formation processes 5 , 6 . The microscale mechanism of its phase evolution during crystallization has yet to be unambiguously defined 13 , 14 . This lack of information has hampered the development of more-rational and targeted design of film-processing methods for efficient FAPbI 3
perovskite absorbers, especially for different film-processing scenarios, such as one-step and two-step film-deposition protocols and small- and large-area devices 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 . A strategy to promote the formation of black-phase FAPbI 3
in one processing scenario usually fails when applied to other situations. In this study we observed an oriented nucleation mechanism that originated from the reduced surface energy of a specific crystallographic plane, and this enabled us to avoid the yellow phase of FAPbI 3
and governed the formation of black-phase FAPbI 3 . We verified the mechanism for different film-deposition methods and found it could be applied to improve the performance of both small-area devices and solar modules. In a two-step deposition protocol for perovskite films, in which the PbI 2
and organo-halide precursors were deposited sequentially, intermediate non-photoactive phases were always observed at room temperature. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the deposited perovskite film at room temperature showed diffraction peaks corresponding to the (100) planes of the black phase, accompanied by diffraction peaks of the the hexagonal perovskite polytype 2H and 6H intermediate phases (Fig.
1a ). When pentanamidine hydrochloride (PAD) was incorporated in the precursor of the organic cations, the intermediate phases were eliminated. Density-functional theory calculations and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were used to investigate how PAD interacts with the Pb–I framework. As modelled in Fig.
1b , the positively charged amidinium head of PAD was able to anchor into the octahedral cavity of the black-phase perovskite by means of electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions. Peak shifts of the C=N and N–H vibration could be seen in the FTIR spectra of PAD after mixing with PbI 2 , confirming the strong interaction between PAD and the Pb–I framework through the amidinium unit (Extended Data Fig.
1 ). This interaction exposed the hydrophobic alkyl chain of PAD such that it was stacked in an ordered manner on the black-phase perovskite (100) plane. As a result, compared with the other planes, the surface energy of the perovskite (100) plane was decreased the most (it fell by 64% from 3.16 to 1.14 eV) when the plane was terminated by PAD (see Supplementary Note
1
for details of the calculation and the variations in surface energy of different crystallographic planes). The configuration of this interaction was corroborated by the formation of a two-dimensional perovskite phase, characterized by XRD of the perovskite film fabricated with PAD (Supplementary Fig.
1 ). The reduced dimension of the perovskite phase evidenced the extremely low surface energy of the (100) plane. This thermodynamic driving force led to the preferential formation of the (100) orientation of black-phase perovskite, which determined the crystallization texture and promoted the formation of black-phase perovskite crystals. By contrast, the relatively even energy profile of the phase transformation process without PAD resulted in the coexistence of several phases and orientations (Fig.
1c ). Fig. 1: Direct formation of black-phase FAPbI 3

2 . In situ grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements revealed that the perovskite nucleated when the formamidinium iodide solution was dropped onto pre-deposited PbI 2 ; this could be seen by the emergence of the perovskite (100) diffraction peak (Fig.
2a ). During the spin-coating process, the peak intensity of the (100) plane gradually increased, which we describe as a nucleation stage in which the disappearance, formation and growth of the nuclei take place concurrently. The subsequent annealing step led to a rapid rise in the intensity of the (100) peak, indicating a fast crystal growth process. During the nucleation stage, the control perovskite film showed diffraction peaks corresponding to multiple intermediate phases, whereas the film using PAD featured a clean (100) diffraction pattern of black-phase perovskite. This finding indicates that incorporating PAD suppressed the formation of yellow phases from the start of the nucleation process. Notably, the control film had a faster increase in the (100) peak intensity during the nucleation stage than that with PAD, indicating that PAD led to delayed nucleation kinetics. This slower nucleation may be attributed to the strong interaction of PAD with the Pb–I framework, because the formamidinium had to compete with PAD to interact with the Pb–I, slowing down the reaction. The in situ azimuth angle mapping was extracted from the GIXRD patterns of the perovskite (100) plane during the nucleation stage (Fig.
2b ). The azimuth angle showed a broad distribution ranging approximately from 60° to 120°, indicating that the control sample had a fairly random crystallographic orientation. However, a sharp peak centred at the azimuth angle of 90° was observed when PAD was incorporated, and the half-peak width remained as small as around 8°. These findings verified that there is a nucleation stage with a preferred out-of-plane orientation along the (100) facet, which we described as an oriented nucleation mechanism.

c , The evolution of the photoluminescence spectra during the nucleation stage of perovskite films without PAD (top) and with PAD (bottom). Full size image We studied the proposed mechanism further by varying the length of the alkyl chain attached to the organic amidinium cation, thereby modulating the effect on the surface energy. Butylamidine hydrochloride (BAD) and propionamidine hydrochloride (PRD), which have shorter alkyl chains than PAD, were investigated. Calculations based on density-functional theory revealed an increase in the surface energy of the perovskite (100) plane as the alkyl chain became shorter (Extended Data Fig.
2 ). The (100) plane that terminated with PRD, BAD or PAD, which featured an increasingly elongated and exposed organic tail and thus increased hydrophobicity, had a calculated surface energy of 1.57, 1.20 and 1.14 eV nm −2 , respectively. In situ GIXRD measurements revealed that both BAD and PRD suppressed the formation of intermediate photo-inactive phases during the nucleation stage (Extended Data Fig.
3 ). However, the in situ azimuth angle mapped during the nucleation stage demonstrated different levels of oriented nucleation as the surface energy varied (Extended Data Fig.
4 ). Because adding PAD provided the lowest surface energy of the perovskite (100) plane, it induced the most-oriented nucleation of the three additives. Despite the ability of BAD and PRD to induce more-oriented nucleation than the control sample, they resulted in broader azimuth-angle distributions than did PAD. These observations demonstrated that the oriented nucleation and the promoted formation of black-phase perovskite were governed by the surface energy of perovskite (100) plane. In situ photoluminescence measurements provided further evidence of the sluggish nucleation kinetics. The evolution of the photoluminescence spectra of the perovskite films during the nucleation stage is shown in Fig.
2c . Without PAD, a photoluminescence peak at 770 nm rose rapidly, which we attribute to the photoactive perovskite phase. With PAD in the precursor solution, the photoluminescence peak appeared at 760 nm with delayed kinetics. The slight blue-shift in the photoluminescence peak could be attributed to the smaller size of the nuclei, which could either lead to compressive lattice strain or induce stronger quantum confinement (Extended Data Fig.
5 ). This in turn provided evidence of the slower nucleation kinetics in perovskite films with PAD. Sluggish nucleation kinetics were also observed for BAD and PRD (Extended Data Fig.
6 ), but to a lesser extent than for PAD, further confirming the important role of surface energy in regulating the crystallization. The strong interaction between the inorganic framework of the perovskite and the PAD cation lowered the surface energy of the (100) plane, leading to slower nucleation kinetics with preferred crystallographic orientation. This oriented nucleation mechanism governed the subsequent crystal growth step, which also followed the preferred orientation along the (100) facet 19
(Supplementary Fig.
2 ). The resulting perovskite film exhibited higher crystallinity and conductivity, as indicated by the increased intensity of the XRD patterns and by conductive atomic-force-microscopy measurements, respectively (Supplementary Figs.
3
and
4 ). The film also had larger grain sizes as a result of the slower nucleation (Supplementary Fig.
5 ). The enhanced photoluminescence intensity and prolonged photoluminescence lifetime of the PAD-based perovskite film indicated that there were fewer non-radiative recombination sites (Extended Data Fig.
7 ). We investigated the incorporation of PAD in a one-step deposition protocol and observed the elimination of the yellow phase. As revealed by the in situ XRD measurements, a mixture of intermediate phases appeared with the black-phase perovskite during crystallization in the absence of PAD (Fig.
3a ). By contrast, incorporating PAD eliminated all the intermediate phases, leading to a single diffraction feature apparent from the (100) plane of black-phase perovskite (Fig.
3b ). In situ photoluminescence measurements of the perovskite films with and without PAD were performed (Supplementary Note
3 ). The evolution profiles of the photoluminescence peak positions and photoluminescence intensity with time are shown in Fig.
3c , d , respectively. In the control sample, we observed a turning point (highlighted by the red dashed area in Fig.
3c , d ) in the evolution profile of the photoluminescence peak position, which coincides with fluctuations in photoluminescence intensity. In general, changes in the photoluminescence peak position may be related to lattice or structural changes. Therefore this turning point might indicate the emergence of intermediate phases during the crystallization, in addition to the black phase. The perovskite film with PAD instead exhibited a smooth photoluminescence evolution profile for both peak position and peak intensity, further verifying the direct conversion to the black phase. The perovskite film with PAD exhibited considerably enhanced photoluminescence intensity and photoluminescence lifetime (Fig.
3e , f ), indicative of pure black-phase perovskite with reduced non-radiative recombination sites in the film.

Full size image We subsequently evaluated the photovoltaic performance of the fabricated solar-cell devices. For the two-step deposition protocol (Extended Data Fig.
8 ), the device made with PAD had the best power conversion efficiency (PCE), achieving 24.0%, whereas the best control device had a PCE of only 22.9%, primarily because the PAD version had an increased fill factor and open circuit voltage (Fig.
4a ). This was attributed to the reduced non-radiative recombination in the device with PAD, as demonstrated by the slower transient photovoltage decay (Supplementary Fig.
6 ). The short-circuit currents of the device were marginally enhanced, reflecting the slightly faster transient photocurrent decay of the device with PAD 20 , 21
(Supplementary Fig.
7 ). A similar trend in device performance was observed for the one-step method (Fig.
4b
and Extended Data Fig.
9 ). The device with PAD demonstrated an improved PCE of up to 25.4% (certified at 25.0%). The histogram of PCEs for 36 devices is shown in Fig.
4c
(the detailed parameters are shown in Supplementary Table
1 ), which confirms that the performance improvements of devices made with PAD were highly reproducible (a 5.6% improvement in average PCE from 23.7 ± 0.4% to 25.0 ± 0.4% when PAD was incorporated). We further extended the application of PAD to the fabrication of solar modules to verify its compatibility with upscaled devices. A high aperture efficiency of 21.4% (certified) was achieved for the PAD-based perovskite module with an area of 27.83 cm 2
(Fig.
4d ). The module showed an average PCE of 20.4%, whereas the control module had an average PCE of only 18.9%, further demonstrating the universality of the approach (Extended Data Fig.
10 ). Our fabricated devices also demonstrated considerably improved operational stability. When tracked at the maximum power point (MPP) with constant illumination at 30 ± 3 °C, the PCE of the control device fell by 30%, whereas the device fabricated with PAD maintained 95% of its initial PCE after more than 1,000 h (Fig.
4e ). In an accelerated-ageing test at 65 ± 3 °C and 85 ± 5% relative humidity, the device with PAD kept more than 82% of its initial PCE after more than 500 h when held at the MPP under constant illumination, whereas the PCE of the control device decreased by around 37% (Supplementary Fig.
8 ). This increased stability could be attributed to the higher crystallinity, reduced defect density and reduced surface energy caused by PAD 8 , 22 , 23
(Supplementary Fig.
9 ). Fig. 4: Performance of the photovoltaic devices. a , b , Current density–voltage curves of the perovskite photovoltaic devices fabricated using two-step ( a ) and one-step ( b ) deposition methods with and without PAD.

Device fabrication Fabrication of perovskite solar cells by the two-step method In the two-step method, perovskite solar cells were fabricated with the following structure: indium tin oxide (ITO)/SnO 2 /FA 0.95 Cs 0.05 PbI 3 /Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag (or Au). The ITO glass was precleaned in an ultrasonic bath of acetone and isopropanol and was ultraviolet light–ozone treated for 20 min before use. A thin layer (around 30 nm) of SnO 2
was spin-coated onto the ITO glass and baked at 165 °C for 35 min. SnO 2
solution was diluted in water ( V SnO2 : V H2O
at a ratio of 1:4) before spin-coating. After cooling to room temperature, the glass, ITO and SnO 2
substrates were transferred to a nitrogen glove box. The PbI 2
solution was prepared by dissolving 1.4 M PbI 2
and 0.07 M CsI into 1 ml DMF or DMSO (v/v 94/6). The FAI solution for the control film was prepared by dissolving 80 mg FAI and 13 mg MACl in 1 ml isopropanol. For the preparation of precursors with PAD, BAD or PRD, 2.05 mg PAD, 1.84 mg BAD or 1.63 mg PRD was added to the FAI solution in isopropanol. The solution was stirred overnight before use. To fabricate the perovskite layer, the PbI 2
solution was spin-coated on the substrate at 1,500 rpm for 40 s, and the FAI–PAD, FAI–BAD or FAI–PRD solution was then spin-coated on the PbI 2
film at 1,800 rpm for 40 s, followed by pre-annealing in the glove box at 90 °C for 1 min and annealing outside the glove box at 150 °C for 10 min with 30–40% humidity. The first-step and second-step precursors are denoted as the PbI 2
solution and the FAI solution, respectively, for simplicity, with the exact compositions described above). The Spiro-OMeTAD solution (60 mg Spiro-OMeTAD in 700 µl chlorobenzene with 25.5 µl 4- tert -butylpyridine, 15.5 µl Li–TFSI (520 mg ml −1
in ACN) and 12.5 µl FK209 (375 mg ml −1
in ACN)) was spun onto the perovskite film as a hole conductor. The devices were completed by evaporating 100 nm of either gold or silver in a vacuum chamber (base pressure, 5 × 10 −4  Pa), and the aperture area of the device is 0.1 cm 2 , designated by the shadow mask. Fabrication of perovskite solar cells by the one-step method The device with an architecture of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass/compact TiO 2
layer (c-TiO 2 )/compact SnO 2
layer, (c-SnO 2 )/Cs 0.05 MA 0.05 FA 0.9 PbI 3
(PVK)/spiro-OMeTAD (HTM)/Au structure was fabricated. The patterned FTO substrate (Asahi FTO glass, 12–13 Ω cm  −2 ) was sequentially cleaned with detergent (5% Hellmanex in water), deionized water, acetone and isopropanol in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min. The FTO substrate was then further cleaned with ultraviolet light–ozone surface treatment for 15 min. The c-TiO 2
and SnO 2
layers were sequentially deposited on the clean FTO substrate by chemical bath deposition. The substrate was annealed on a hotplate at 190 °C for 60 min. The perovskite precursor solution (1.4 M) was prepared by adding 645.4 mg PbI 2 , 216.7 mg FAI, 11.1 mg methylammonium iodide and 11.8 mg CsCl into a mixture of 200 μl DMSO and 800 μl DMF. The solution was then stirred for 2 h at 60 °C before 2.09 mg PAD was dissolved into 1.0 ml of DMSO to make a stock solution (concentration around 0.52 M). After ultraviolet light–ozone treatment of the substrates for 15 min, the perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated onto the surface of the FTO/c-TiO 2 /c-SnO 2
substrate at 1,000 rpm for 10 s, accelerated to 5,000 rpm for 5 s and maintained at this speed for 20 s. This process was done in an N 2 -filled glove box. The substrate was then placed in custom-made rapid vacuum drying equipment. After pumping for 20 s, a brown, transparent perovskite film with a mirror-like surface was obtained. The fresh perovskite layer was annealed at 100 °C for 1 h and then at 150 °C for 10 min. Then 60 μl phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) solution (5 mg ml −1
in isopropanol) was spin-coated on the perovskite film at 5,000 rpm for 30 s. A hole transport layer was deposited on the perovskite film by depositing a doped spiro-OMeTAD solution at 3,000 rpm for 30 s. The doped spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 105 mg of spiro-OMeTAD and 41 μl 4- tert -butylpyridine in 1,343 μl chlorobenzene with an additional 25 μl Li–TFSI solution (517 mg ml −1
in ACN) and 19 μl cobalt-complex solution (376 mg ml −1
in ACN). Finally, a gold layer approximately 70 nm thick was evaporated on the spiro-OMeTAD layer as the back electrode, and the aperture area of the certified device is 0.06 cm 2 . Fabrication of perovskite modules Perovskite solar modules, with 8 subcells connected in series, were fabricated on FTO glass substrates with a size of 6.5 × 7.0 cm. The series interconnection of the module was realized by P1, P2 and P3 lines, which were patterned using a laser scribing system with a 1,064 nm laser and a power of 20 W (Trotec). The FTO substrate was pre-patterned for P1 (a width of 50 μm) by means of 60% laser power at a speed of 300 mm s −1
with a frequency of 65 kHz and a pulse width of 120 ns. The subsequent processes for the preparation of c-TiO 2
and c-SnO 2
substrates are the same as the procedures for the small-area device. The perovskite precursor deposition and fabrication procedures were similar to those of the small-size solar cells, except for the concentration of perovskite precursor. A perovskite precursor (1.2 M) was used to make the perovskite layer by spin-coating and the custom-made gas-induced pump method. The perovskite precursor was spin-coated on the c-TiO 2
and c-SnO 2
substrates, which are similar to those for the small-size devices. The perovskite films were annealed at 100 °C for 1 h and 150 °C for 10 min. After cooling to room temperature, the Spiro-OMeTAD layer was similar to those of the small-size devices. The P2 lines (a width of 150 μm) were patterned before the gold evaporation process step with an average laser power of 15% at a speed of 1,000 μm s −1
and a frequency of 65 kHz for a pulse duration of 120 ns. When a gold layer 70 nm thick was deposited, the P3 line (a width of 100 μm) was fabricated under the same scribing conditions as the P2 line. The distance between P1 and P3 was around 400 μm and the geometric fill factor was around 0.93. For solar modules prepared by the blade-coating method (Coatmaster 510), perovskite solar modules with 9 subcells connected in series were fabricated on FTO glass substrates with a size of 6.5 × 7.0 cm. The processes for the preparation of c-TiO 2
and c-SnO 2
substrates and the fabrication of spiro-OMeTAD, as well as the gold electrode, were the same as for the gas-pump method. The perovskite precursor solution (1.2 M) was prepared by dissolving 580.9 mg PbI 2 , 185.7 mg FAI, 9.5 mg methylammonium iodide and 10.8 mg CsCl into 1.0 ml 2-methoxyethanol. The precursor solution was blade-coated onto the c-TiO 2
and c-SnO 2
substrates with a gap of 260 µm at a movement speed of 21 mm s −1
in the N 2
glovebox. The N 2
knife was operated at 30 psi during blade-coating and the as-obtained perovskite films were annealed at 100 °C for 1 h and 150 °C for 10 min. The laser scribing procedures were the same as for the gas-pump method, but the geometric fill factor was 0.91. Stability test The photovoltaic devices to be tested for stability were fabricated as described above. They were encapsulated by a glass–glass encapsulation technology combined with an edge seal (curing sealant 3035B, ThreeBond) to seal the device under ultraviolet light (LED flood lamp, DELOLUX 20). The edge of the device was first cleared by laser. Indium was soldered on the FTO and gold electrodes on the edge of the 15 mm × 25 mm substrate. A glass coverslip with a size of 13 mm × 23 mm was placed on top of the gold layer of the device. Sealant was placed on the edges of the coverslip to seal the gap between the coverslip and device. Finally, ultraviolet light was used to induce cross-linking between the sealant and the coverslip at 25% of maximum power for 120 s in the glove box. For the stability test at ambient conditions (30 ± 3 °C), unencapsulated devices were evaluated. For the accelerated-degradation test, the encapsulated devices were kept in a thermo-hygrostat (GP/TH-150, SH Guangpin), which was set to 85 ± 5% relative humidity at 65 ± 3 °C. The performance of the devices was measured electronically using a 22-bit delta-sigma analogue-to-digital converter. A reference Si photodiode was placed in close to the devices to record the light intensity. Long-term stability tests were done at the MPP using a tracking algorithm for an illumination of 1 sun (standard illumination at 1 kW m −2 ) according to the ISOS-L-3 protocol. Device characterization Current density–voltage characteristics of photovoltaic cells were determined using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit under a simulated AM1.5G spectrum with an Oriel 9600 solar simulator. Typically, small devices were measured in a reverse scan (1.20 V to 0 V with steps of 0.01 V for one-step devices and 1.25 V to 0 V with steps of 0.02 V for two-step devices). The modules were measured in a reverse scan (from 9.45 V to 0 V) at a constant scan speed of 100 mV s −1
with a step of 50 mV. For the measurement of high-efficiency devices, an antireflection film was applied to the surface of devices. All devices were measured without pre-conditioning such as light-soaking or a bias voltage. The steady-state power-conversion efficiency was calculated by measuring the stabilized photocurrent density under a constant bias voltage. External quantum efficiencies were measured using an integrated system (Enlitech) and a lock-in amplifier with a current preamplifier under the short-circuit condition. Material characterization and spectroscopic investigation Ultraviolet-light and visual-light absorption spectra of the perovskite films were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-VIS-NIR (UV3600Plus + UV2700) spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere, in which monochromatic light was incident to the substrate side. To measure time-resolved photoluminescence, the sample was excited using a picosecond-pulse diode laser (Pico-quant LDH 450) with a roughly 70-ps pulse width and a repetition rate of 20 MHz or 10 MHz, focused on a sample with a 100× objective lens and a numerical aperture of 0.90. The photoluminescence signal was acquired through the TCSPC strobelock system. The total instrument response function for the photoluminescence decay was less than 200 ps and the temporal resolution was less than 30 ps. XRD experiments were performed using a sealed-tube Cu X-ray source, equipped with 1D LynxEye detector. The in situ experiment was performed with a high-brilliance rotational point-focused Cu X-ray source, equipped with duo detectors of a scintillation counter and LynxEye. The in situ chamber of TC DOME created a robust heating environment and measurement was initiated with a temperature increasing from room temperature to an air temperature of 450 K, followed by XRD data collection. The transient photovoltage and transient photocurrent were measured by a photo-electrochemical system. A conductive atomic-force microscope was used for environmental atomic force microscopy, and an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer was used (ThermoFisher ESCALAB Xi+). Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV) was used as the excitation source. Transmission FTIR spectroscopy was done using an FT/IR-6100 (Jasco). PAD was mixed with PbI 2
using a molar ratio of 1:1 for the FTIR measurements. Ultraviolet-light photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were carried out to determine the work function and the position of valence band maximum of materials. A helium discharge lamp, emitting ultraviolet-light energy at 21.2 eV, was used for excitation. All ultraviolet-light photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were made using standard procedures with a −10 V bias applied between the samples and detectors. Clean gold was used as a reference. Grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) was performed during spin coating and thermal annealing in a custom-made spin coater. The spin coater is attached to the endstation of beamline 12.3.2 at the Advanced Light Source (ALS), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. This custom-made setup allows thin film fabrication from solutions including remotely triggered antisolvent dripping during the measurement in the hutch. While the film is fabricated, diffraction and PL data can be collected simultaneously. The incoming X-ray beam was at a shallow angle of 1° with a beam energy of 10 keV. A DECTRIS Pilatus 1M X-ray detector at an angle of 35° to the sample plane and a sample-to-detector distance of ~189 mm was used. Measurements were carried out on an area of 0.06 mm 2
(12 mm × 0.005 mm) with an approximate flux of ~109 photons s –1 . The spin coater setup is designed in such a way that the experiment can be performed remotely, avoiding any transfer delays between film deposition and annealing. Samples were heated using a temperature ramp of about 4.5 °C s –1
to their annealing temperature. The diffraction data was collected with a frame rate of 1.8 s –1 . The 2D diffraction images were initially analysed using custom-made software and then further analysed by using Igor Pro 8.04 software using Irena and Nika packages 24 , 25 .

Abstract Phonon scattering limits charge-carrier mobilities and governs emission line broadening in hybrid metal halide perovskites. Establishing how charge carriers interact with phonons in these materials is therefore essential for the development of high-efficiency perovskite photovoltaics and low-cost lasers. Here we investigate the temperature dependence of emission line broadening in the four commonly studied formamidinium and methylammonium perovskites, HC(NH 2 ) 2 PbI 3 , HC(NH 2 ) 2 PbBr 3 , CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
and CH 3 NH 3 PbBr 3 , and discover that scattering from longitudinal optical phonons via the Fröhlich interaction is the dominant source of electron–phonon coupling near room temperature, with scattering off acoustic phonons negligible. We determine energies for the interacting longitudinal optical phonon modes to be 11.5 and 15.3 meV, and Fröhlich coupling constants of
∼ 40 and 60 meV for the lead iodide and bromide perovskites, respectively. Our findings correlate well with first-principles calculations based on many-body perturbation theory, which underlines the suitability of an electronic band-structure picture for describing charge carriers in hybrid perovskites.

Introduction Hybrid lead halide perovskites have attracted intense research activity following their first implementation as light absorbers in thin-film solar cells 1
that now reach power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in excess of 20% (refs
2 ,
3 ). These compounds are described by the general formula ABX 3 , where A is typically an organic cation such as methylammonium (CH 3 NH
or MA + ) or formamidinium (HC(NH 2 )
or FA + ), B is a divalent metal cation (usually Pb 2+ ) and X is a halide anion (I − , Br −
or Cl − ) 4 . Such hybrid organic–inorganic materials straddle the divide between organic and inorganic semiconductors, facilitating photovoltaic devices that combine the low processing costs of the former with the high PCEs of the latter 2 , 3 , 5 . In addition, their structural flexibility allows a wide compositional parameter space to be explored. Although MAPbI 3
is the most commonly investigated perovskite, the currently most efficient perovskite solar cells replace all 2
or most 3
of the MA +
with FA + . FAPbI 3
has the advantage of a smaller bandgap than MAPbI 3
(1.48 versus 1.57 eV), making it more suited for use in single-junction solar cells 6 , and furthermore shows greater resistance to heat stress 6 . High-performing devices have used formulations containing both FA and MA cations, to counteract the thermodynamic instability of FAPbI 3
in its perovskite phase at room temperature 7 , 8 , 9 . Meanwhile, mixed-halide perovskites incorporating both I −
and Br −
have been investigated for use in tandem solar cells 5 , 6 , 10 , as these systems allow for bandgap optimization across a wide tuning range. The success of hybrid perovskites in photovoltaic applications has been widely attributed to their high absorption coefficients across the visible spectrum 11 , their low exciton binding energies 4 , 12
facilitating charge formation and their long charge-carrier diffusion lengths enabling efficient charge extraction 13 , 14 . However, although much recent attention has been devoted towards unravelling the charge-carrier recombination mechanisms underlying these properties 4 , 15 , the interaction of charge carriers with lattice vibrations (phonons) is currently still a subject of intense debate 16 , 17 . Such electron–phonon interactions matter, because they set a fundamental intrinsic limit to charge-carrier mobilities in the absence of extrinsic scattering off impurities or interfaces 18 . In addition, charge-carrier cooling following non-resonant (above bandgap) photon absorption is governed by interactions between charges and phonons 4 . Slow charge-carrier cooling components (compared with GaAs) have been postulated for hybrid perovskites 19 , which may open the possibility for PCEs beyond the Shockley–Queisser limit. Furthermore, electron–phonon coupling has been shown to yield predominantly homogeneous emission line broadening in hybrid lead iodide perovskite at room temperature, making it suitable as a gain medium for short-pulse lasers 20 . Despite the importance of electron–phonon interactions to the optoelectronic properties of these materials, currently no clear picture has emerged of which mechanisms are active. To address this issue, a number of studies have examined the temperature dependence of the charge-carrier mobility
μ , which was found 21 , 22 , 23 , 24
to scale with
T m
with
m
in the range between −1.4 and −1.6. Several groups 16 , 17 , 24
therefore proposed that electron–phonon coupling at room temperature is almost solely governed by deformation potential scattering with acoustic phonons, which is known 18 , 25
to theoretically result in
μ ∝ T −3/2 . Although such behaviour may be adopted by non-polar inorganic semiconductors such as silicon or germanium 18 , 26 , it would be extremely unusual for perovskites that exhibit polar 27 , 28
lead–iodide bonds. These findings have therefore raised the puzzling question of why such hybrid perovskites appear to evade the Fröhlich interactions between charge carriers and polar longitudinal optical (LO) phonon modes that normally govern polar inorganic semiconductors, such as GaAs 18 , 29 , at room temperature. Here we clarify the relative activity of different charge-carrier scattering mechanisms in hybrid lead halide perovskites by investigating charge-carrier scattering through an analysis of the photoluminescence (PL) linewidth as a function of temperature between 10 and 370 K. By carefully examining the low-temperature regime in which thermal energies fall below those of high-energy LO phonon modes, we are able to clearly separate competing contributions from charge-carrier interactions with acoustic and optical phonons. We are therefore able to show unambiguously that Fröhlich coupling to LO phonons is the predominant cause of linewidth broadening in these materials at room temperature, with scattering from acoustic phonons and impurities being a minor component. We further demonstrate excellent agreement between the experimentally determined temperature dependence of the PL linewidth and theoretical values derived from
ab initio
calculations for MAPbI 3 . To elucidate how charge-carrier–phonon interaction strengths depend on perovskite composition, we examine FAPbI 3 , FAPbBr 3 , MAPbI 3
and MAPbBr 3 , which represent a comprehensive set of the most commonly implemented organic and halide ingredients in hybrid perovskites. We show that although the choice of organic cation has relatively little effect on the Fröhlich interactions, bromide perovskites exhibit higher Fröhlich coupling than iodide perovskites as a result of their smaller high-frequency values of the dielectric function. Overall, our results conclusively demonstrate that electron–phonon coupling in hybrid lead halide perovskites follows a classic bandstructure picture for polar inorganic semiconductors, which are dominated by Fröhlich coupling between charge carriers and LO phonon modes in the high-temperature regime. Results Temperature-dependent PL spectra To conduct our analysis of electron–phonon coupling in hybrid lead halide perovskites, we recorded steady-state PL spectra of solution-processed FAPbI 3 , FAPbBr 3 , MAPbI 3
and MAPbBr 3
thin films over temperatures from 10 to 370 K in increments of 5 K ( Fig. 1 ). The observed PL peak positions at room temperature are consistent with those reported previously for these materials 6 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 . The colour plots in
Fig. 1
exhibit abrupt shifts in PL peak energies at various temperatures that are associated with phase transitions commonly found in these relatively soft materials. For example, MAPbI 3 , MAPbBr 3
and FAPbI 3
have been reported to undergo a phase transition from an orthorhombic to a tetragonal structure between 130 and 160 K (refs
30 ,
33 ,
34 ). A further phase transition to the cubic phase follows at higher temperatures for the MA perovskites (at
∼ 330 K for MAPbI 3
(refs
30 ,
34 ) and 240 K for MAPbBr 3
(ref.
34 )), whereas a transition to a trigonal phase occurs at around 200 K for FAPbI 3
(ref.
30 ). The lower-temperature phase transition to the orthorhombic phase below 130–160 K is generally associated with larger energetic shifts as it marks a strong reduction in the extent of rotational freedom of the organic cation 34 , 35 , 36 . Higher-temperature structural changes are more subtle in this regard and therefore much harder to discern 21 . Apart from these discontinuities, the PL peak in all four materials shifts continuously towards higher energy with increasing temperature. This general trend is in contrast to that of typical semiconductors such as Si, Ge and GaAs, for which the bandgap decreases with temperature as a result of lattice dilation 26 , 37 . The atypical positive bandgap deformation potential of hybrid lead halide perovskites has been attributed to a stabilization of out-of-phase band-edge states as the lattice expands 38 .

and ( d ) MAPbBr 3
thin films at temperatures between 10 and 370 K. Full size image In addition to these well-understood temperature trends, the PL spectra of MA-containing perovskites exhibit strong inhomogeneous broadening and multi-peak emission in the low-temperature orthorhombic phase. Such behaviour has been reported by ourselves 21 , 39
and others 24 , 31 , 40 , 41
on many occasions, yet a precise explanation is still outstanding. For example, the PL spectra of MAPbI 3
develop additional peaks at temperatures below 150 K, as can be seen clearly in
Supplementary Fig. 1 , which shows spectra from the colour plots in
Fig. 1
at selected temperatures. The emerging consensus is that these are caused by additional charge or exciton trap states that are only active in the low-temperature orthorhombic phase 21 , 24 , 31 , 39 , 40 , 41 . It has been proposed that these traps could derive from a small fraction of inclusions of the room-temperature tetragonal phase that are populated through charge or exciton transfer from the majority orthorhombic phase 39 . These inclusions could be a result of strain or the proposed impossibility of a continuous structural transition from the tetragonal to orthorhombic phase in MA perovskites, as reported by Baikie
et al . 35 . We further note that as these complicating features do not appear in the PL spectra of the equivalent FA perovskites, they are probably not intrinsic to hybrid lead halide perovskites, which re-affirms the prevailing view that they originate from trap states. Importantly, the lack of uncomplicated low-temperature spectra has to date prevented proper analysis of the linewidth broadening of MA perovskites and the associated phonon coupling to charge carriers. As we show below, such analysis requires access to a low-temperature range over which PL spectra are dominated by intrinsic phonon broadening, rather than trap-related PL, for the contributions from acoustic and optical phonons to the clearly separated. Therefore, the discovery that the equivalent FA lead halide perovskites do not exhibit extrinsic defect-related PL in the low temperature range allows us to carry out such analysis unhindered. Analysis of PL linewidth broadening Analysis of temperature-dependent emission broadening has long been used to assess the mechanisms of electron–phonon coupling in a wide range of inorganic semiconductors 42
(see
Supplementary Table 1
for a literature overview of the results). We here apply these methods to hybrid lead halide perovskites by first extracting the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the PL spectra shown in
Fig. 1
and then analysing its temperature dependence (plotted in
Fig. 2 ). For most inorganic semiconductors, different mechanisms of scattering between charge carriers and phonons or impurities are associated with different functional dependencies of the PL linewidth
Г(T)
on temperature, which can be expressed as the sum over the various contributions 42 , 43 : Figure 2: Temperature dependence of linewidth. FWHM of the steady-state PL spectra as a function of temperature for ( a ) FAPbI 3 , ( b ) FAPbBr 3 , ( c ) MAPbI 3
and ( d ) MAPbBr 3
thin films plotted as black dots. The solid red lines are fits of
Г ( T )= Г 0 + Г LO , which account for contributions from inhomogeneous broadening and Fröhlich coupling with LO phonons. For the perovskites containing MA, the fits are extrapolated into the low-temperature region in which the model does not hold, as indicated by dashed red lines (actual fits were carried out between 150 and 370 K for MAPbI 3 , and between 100 and 370 K for MAPbBr 3 ). The inset shows the functional form of the temperature dependence of the contributions to PL linewidth in semiconductors from inhomogeneous broadening ( Г 0 , magenta), Fröhlich coupling between charge carriers and LO phonons ( Г LO , red) and acoustic phonons ( Г ac , blue), and scattering from ionized impurities ( Г imp , green), as given by the terms of equation (1). An alternative presentation of the linewidths as a mutliple of the thermal energy is given in
Supplementary Fig. 2 . Full size image Here,
Г 0
is a temperature-independent inhomogeneous broadening term, which arises from scattering due to disorder and imperfections 42 , 44 . The second and third terms ( Г ac
and
Г LO ) are homogeneous broadening terms, which result from acoustic and LO phonon (Fröhlich) scattering 28 , 42 , 44
with charge-carrier–phonon coupling strengths of
γ ac
and
γ LO , respectively. Electron–phonon coupling is in general proportional to the occupation numbers of the respective phonons, as given by the Bose–Einstein distribution function 45 , 46 , taken as
for LO phonons, where
E LO
is an energy representative of the frequency for the weakly dispersive LO phonon branch 18 , 47 . For acoustic phonons whose energy is much smaller than
k B T
over the typical observation range, a linear dependence on temperature is generally assumed 46 , 48 .
Ab initio
calculations of the relevant phonon energies and occupation numbers are shown in
Supplementary Fig. 4 , which confirms that the linear approximation to the acoustic phonon population used in equation (1) is appropriate. The final term,
Г imp , phenomenologically accounts for scattering from ionized impurities with an average binding energy
E b
(ref.
43 ). These impurities contribute
γ imp
of inhomogeneous broadening to the width when fully ionized 43 , 45 . In general, the two major mechanisms governing the electron–phonon coupling in inorganic semiconductors are deformation potential scattering, in which distortions of the lattice change the electronic band structure, and electromechanical or piezoelectric interactions, in which lattice-related electric fields modify the electronic Hamiltonian 18 . Specifically, the LO phonon term in equation (1) accounts for the Fröhlich interaction between LO phonons and electrons, which arises from the Coulomb interaction between the electrons and the macroscopic electric field induced by the out-of-phase displacements of oppositely charged atoms caused by the LO phonon mode 18 . Although both transverse optical and LO phonons interact with electrons via non-polar deformation potentials, equation (1) only accounts for LO phonons because of the dominant influence of their Fröhlich interaction with electrons in polar crystals at higher temperatures 49 . As optical phonons in semiconductors typically have energies of the order of tens of meV (ref.
18 ), their population at low temperatures ( T <100 K) is very small; thus, homogeneous broadening in this regime predominantly results from acoustic phonons 18 , 49 . Therefore, careful examination of the low-temperature regime allows separation of the contributions from optical and acoustic modes. Long-wavelength acoustic phonons induce atomic displacements, which can correspond to macroscopic crystal deformation, affecting electronic energies via either the resultant deformation potential or a piezoelectrically induced electric field 18 . To establish qualitatively which electron–phonon scattering mechanisms contribute in hybrid lead halide perovskites, we compare the temperature-dependent PL linewidth plotted in
Fig. 2
with the functional form of the terms in equation (1). To aid comparison, the inset to
Fig. 2a
shows example functions for the separate components. First, we assess the possibility of electron scattering with ionized impurities playing a significant role. Comparison of the curves in the inset with the data in the main
Fig. 2
makes it apparent that the shape of the ionized impurity scattering term
Г imp
could not produce the observed linear variation with
T
of the linewidths at high temperatures. Therefore, we conclude that scattering with ionized impurities does not play any major role here, in agreement with findings based on recent analyses of the temperature-dependence of the charge-carrier mobility in this regime 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 . We therefore assume
Г imp ≈0 for the rest of the analysis. To separate the contributions from acoustic and optical phonon modes, we first focus on an analysis of the PL linewidth for perovskites containing FA as the organic cation. As
Fig. 2a,b
show, these materials exhibit smooth variation of the linewidth, whereas for MA-containing perovskites the presence of the impurity emission discussed above leads to additional emission broadening in the low-temperature phase ( Fig. 2c,d ). Both FAPbI 3
and FAPbBr 3
approach a PL linewidth of the order of 20 meV towards
T =0, which can therefore be identified as the temperature-independent inhomogeneous broadening term
Г 0
arising from disorder. To qualitatively assess the relative importance of acoustic versus optical phonon contributions, an inspection of the gradient of these curves in the low-temperature regime is essential. Although the optical phonon terms lead to a gradient of zero in the regime for which
E LO < k B T , the smaller energies of acoustic phonons should result in a non-zero gradient given by
γ ac
here. However, visual inspection of the graphs in
Fig. 2a,b
shows that the gradient of the FWHM versus temperature approaches zero at low temperature, suggesting negligible acoustic phonon contribution ( γ ac ≈0). Indeed, we find that fits of equation (1) to these curves converge with
γ ac →0. This result is not surprising, given that in polar inorganic semiconductors the contribution of acoustic phonons to the broadening at room temperature is typically dwarfed by that of the LO phonons and indeed several studies ignore the contribution of acoustic phonons in such systems 49 . However, we may obtain an upper limit to
γ ac
by careful examination of the data in the low-temperature regime in which acoustic phonons are still expected to contribute significantly. Here we may fit
Г ( T )= Г 0 + γ ac T
to the data in the low-temperature ( T <60 K) region 50
or, as an alternative method, obtain the gradient of the data near
T =0 K from differentiation. Both methods yield upper limits around
γ ac =60±20 μeV K −1
for FAPbI 3
and FAPbBr 3 ; therefore, acoustic phonons will only contribute up to
∼ 18 meV to the linewidth broadening at 300 K. Hence, our analysis illustrates that the majority of broadening in the room-temperature regime arises from charge-carrier interactions with optical phonons, as would be expected for a polar semiconductor. To further quantify the dominant Fröhlich coupling in these systems, we proceed by fitting all data including only the mechanisms based on temperature-independent inhomogeneous broadening and Fröhlich coupling to LO phonon modes. For perovskites containing FA cations, fits of
Г ( T )= Г 0 + Г LO
to the PL linewidth data are plotted in
Fig. 2a,b
(red lines) and the extracted fitting parameters are presented in
Table 1 . Apart from Fröhlich coupling strengths, we are also able to determine the energy of LO phonon modes that play the dominant role in electron–LO-phonon coupling. We find
E LO =11.5 meV for FAPbI 3 , with the value for FAPbBr 3
(15.3 meV) being 1.3 times larger, which is only slightly greater than the factor of 1.2 expected from a crude model of the frequency of a diatomic harmonic oscillator. These LO phonon energies of hybrid lead halide perovskites are somewhat lower than those typically measured for a range of inorganic semiconductors (see
Supplementary Table 1
for an overview); however, they agree well with a recent combined experimental and density functional theory (DFT) study assigning LO phonon modes of the Pb-I lattice in MAPbI 3
with energies near 10 meV (ref.
51 ) and with our present calculations (see next section). Table 1 Extracted linewidth parameters. Full size table As noted above, the situation is more complex for MA perovskites, owing to the additional trap-related emission in the low-temperature orthorhombic phase that gives rise to sizeable (>100 meV) additional broadening (see
Fig. 2c,d ). However, in the high-temperature regime, PL linewidths of the MA perovskites vary much in the same manner as that of their FA counterparts, suggesting very similar mechanisms. This may be expected, as the organic cation has relatively little influence on the vibrations of the lead-halide lattice. Hence, we model the linewidth broadening of MA perovskites in the high-temperature regime again using
Г ( T )= Г 0 + Г LO
(solid red lines in
Fig. 2c,d ), using the LO phonon energies determined previously for FA perovskites. The resultant
γ LO
values are, as expected, very similar to those for the corresponding FA perovskites ( Table 1 ). We may also extrapolate these fits down through the low-temperature regime (dashed red lines), where they do not reflect experimental reality but rather show the broadening that would be present if the additional defects in the orthorhombic phase were absent. As such, values extracted for the parameter
Г 0
here mostly reflect inhomogeneous disorder present in the high-temperature phases of MAPbI 3
and MAPbBr 3
at temperatures above 150 and 100 K, respectively. Finally, we comment on the extent to which excitonic effects may influence the coupling between charge carriers and phonons. Although the exact values for the exciton-binding energies in these systems are still a matter of debate, most reported values fall into the range of a few to a few tens of milli-electronvolts (see ref.
4
for a review). These values are compatible with numerous studies demonstrating that at room temperature, following non-resonant excitation, hybrid lead halide perovskites sustain free charge carriers as the predominant species 13 , 14 , 52 . Excitonic effects in the generated charge-carrier population are expected to increase as the temperature is lowered. However, we have recently examined infrared photoinduced transmission spectra for methylammonium lead iodide perovskite 21
and found these to be predominantly governed by free-charge (Drude-like) features, with localization effects (for example, from excitons) only contributing at low temperature and not more than around 23% even at 8 K. This suggests that over the temperature window we examine here, emission broadening is mostly governed by interactions between phonons and free charge carriers rather than excitons. Such predominantly free-charge behaviour of the photogenerated species may be understood, for example, in terms of the Saha equation or a low Mott density for these systems, and considering that the initial highly non-resonant excitation generates predominantly free electron–hole pairs 12 . We may further inspect in more detail the temperature-dependent line shapes of the emission spectra and find these to exhibit high-energy Boltzmann tails corresponding to a thermalized electron–hole density near the lattice temperature (see
Supplementary Fig. 3 ). These overall observations are therefore compatible with the presence of a thermalized free electron–hole charge-carrier density that scatters off mostly LO phonons whose occupancy is governed by the Bose–Einstein distribution function. Analysis of how the energies of such thermalized free electrons and holes influence the precise lineshape of the PL spectra as a function of temperature could provide additional insight into the scattering mechanisms for free charge carriers. Such additional analysis is however beyond the scope of the present investigation, which is limited to considering only the extent of linewidth broadening. First-principles calculations We further corroborate our analysis with first-principles calculations of the electron–phonon coupling in MAPbI 3
(see details in Methods section and in the
Supplementary Note 1 ). In accordance with the above discussion, we separately consider the broadening arising from the interaction of phonons with free conduction-band electrons and free valence-band holes 53 . The combined broadening arising from both types of charge carrier is then compared with the experimentally determined emission broadening. In
Fig. 3a , we present a heat-map of the imaginary part of the electron–phonon self-energy, Im( Σ ), projected on the quasiparticle band structure of MAPbI 3 ; 2 Im( Σ ) represents the linewidth of electrons and holes arising from the electron–phonon interaction before accounting for many-body effects (see Methods) and is therefore directly comparable to the experimentally determined FWHM of the PL emission linewidth.
Figure 3b
shows Im( Σ ) as a function of electron energy, together with the density of electronic states. This figure indicates that the increase in the linewidth is linked to the phase-space availability for electronic transitions, that is, Im( Σ ) increases with increasing density of electronic states, because each state can scatter into a higher number of states by absorbing or emitting a phonon. Our calculations show that the dominant contribution to the electron–phonon self-energy arises from the coupling with the LO mode at
, which is shown schematically in
Fig. 3c . This observation is compatible with the analysis of the temperature dependence of the PL broadening, as presented in
Fig. 2 , yielding similar energy for the predominantly coupling LO phonon mode in MAPbI 3 . Figure 3:

( d ) Temperature dependence of the FWHM of the PL peak in MAPbI 3 : fit to the experimental data (dashed black line) and theoretical calculations using Fermi’s golden rule (blue triangles) and the more accurate Brillouin–Wigner perturbation theory (red triangles). The theoretical broadening is obtained as the sum of 2 lm( Σ ) at the valence and conduction band edges in the case of Fermi’s golden rule, and the sum of 2 Z lm( Σ ) when including many-body quasiparticle renormalization, rigidly shifted by the FWHM at
T =0 K (25.72 meV), to account for inhomogenous broadening. The lines are guides to the eye. Full size image Figure 3d
shows that our calculated temperature dependence of the PL broadening is in good agreement with experiment. In this figure we compared our calculations with the experimental trends obtained from the fit shown in
Fig. 2
(which does not account for the anomalous broadening below 150 K, as discussed above). The blue triangles represent the data calculated based on Fermi’s golden rule, which is equivalent to using the imaginary part of the electron–phonon self-energy, 2 Im( Σ ), whereas the red triangles were obtained by using Brillouin–Wigner perturbation theory 54 , which corresponds to scaling the self-energy by the quasiparticle renormalization factor
Z , that is 2
Z
Im( Σ ) (see Methods). The comparison between calculations and experiments shows that the experimental data are most accurately described by fully taking into account the many-body renormalization of the electron lifetime. Taken together, the impressive agreement between (1) our measured and calculated characteristic phonon energy scale (11.5 and 13 meV, respectively), (2) the magnitude of our measured and calculated linewidth broadening at room temperature (90 and 75 meV, respectively), and (3) the phonon energy scale identified here and the LO phonon identified between 10 and 13 meV in our previous study 51 , strongly support the notion that the broadening of the PL spectra reflects the interaction between free carriers and LO phonons. In addition, we may use first-principle calculations to elucidate why the lead bromide perovskites exhibit Fröhlich coupling constants that are larger than those of the lead iodide system by a factor of 1.5. To investigate this trend, we performed DFT calculations for MAPbBr 3
(see
Supplementary Note 1 ) to compare the associated Born effective charges between the two systems. Our results indicate that the electron–phonon coupling in the bromide perovskite is 40% stronger than in the iodide perovskite, in excellent agreement with our measurements. We find that the increased Fröhlich coupling in MAPbBr 3
is primarily connected with the smaller high-frequency value of the dielectric function compared with MAPbI 3 . Discussion Our analysis of the experimentally determined emission linewidth broadening and our first-principles calculations strongly support the notion that Fröhlich coupling to LO phonons is the predominant charge-carrier scattering mechanism in hybrid lead halide perovskites. As already discussed above, such behaviour is in many ways to be expected for these materials, because the lead-halide bond is sufficiently polar (see our calculated Born effective charges in
Supplementary Table 2 ) to lead to macroscopic polarizations from LO phonon modes that modify the electronic energies, causing electron–phonon scattering. Coupling of charge carriers to phonons with energies in the meV range has also been postulated from the signature of such modes in the room- and low-temperature photoconductivity spectra 21 , 56 . However, the predominance of Fröhlich coupling appears at first sight to contradict the measured 21 , 22 , 23 , 24
temperature dependence of the charge-carrier mobility, which has been stated 16 , 17 , 24
to approach the expected form for acoustic deformation potential scattering ( μ ∝ T −3/2 ). We note, however, that although electron–phonon coupling generally leads to charge-carrier mobilities that increase with decreasing temperature, the exact functional dependence is usually a composite of many different scattering mechanisms that can be hard to attribute uniquely 18 . Charge-carrier scattering with low-energy acoustic phonons can relatively easily be quantified by considering the distribution function of a nondegenerate electron gas approximated by a Boltzmann distribution, which gives the probability that a particular state with energy
E k
is occupied at any temperature
T . Such calculations result in predicted variations in mobility following
μ ∝ T −3/2
for acoustic phonon deformation potential scattering 25 , 26
and
μ ∝ T −1/2
for acoustic phonon piezoelectric scattering 18 . For Fröhlich interactions between charges and LO phonons, analytical solutions are harder to establish 57 , but the reduction in LO phonon occupancy with decreasing temperature similarly leads to an increase in charge-carrier mobility in polar semiconductors 18 . Even for non-polar semiconductors such as silicon, electron–phonon interactions are found to be complex, for example, involving higher-order phonon terms and intervalley scattering 58 . Therefore, we conclude that although acoustic phonon deformation potential scattering may result in
μ ∝ T −3/2 , the converse may not necessarily also hold. In addition, the rapid energy loss of electrons observed following non-resonant excitation 19 , 59
can only sensibly be explained by a succession of high-energy optical phonon emissions 60 , as is typically observed in inorganic semiconductors 4 , 61 . Therefore, we conclude that Fröhlich coupling to LO phonons, rather than acoustic phonon deformation potential coupling, is the dominant charge-carrier scattering mechanism at room temperature in these hybrid lead halide perovskites. Although our findings themselves do not explain the temperature dependence of the charge-carrier mobility in these materials, they support the hypothesis that the observed
μ ∝ T −3/2
relationship is not wholly attributable to acoustic deformation potential scattering. It is also clear that for these high-quality materials, scattering from ionized impurities is a negligible component at room temperature, with both our PL linewidth data and earlier charge-carrier mobility measurements 21 , 22 , 23 , indicating a complete absence of such contributions. In addition, our findings give early answers to the question of how perovskite composition affects Fröhlich interactions between charge carriers and phonons. Such interactions determine the maximum charge-carrier mobilities intrinsically attainable, which in turn affects charge-carrier extraction in solar cells. We show that Fröhlich coupling in hybrid lead bromide perovskites appears to be stronger because of the lower dielectric function in the high-frequency regime. Indeed, the THz charge-carrier mobility for FAPbBr 3
thin films has recently been shown to be somewhat lower than that for FAPbI 3
films 10 , which could be related to decreased momentum scattering time resulting from increased scattering with LO phonons. However, it may also be partly related to a higher propensity towards disorder in the bromide perovskites, as the inhomogeneous broadening parameter
Г 0
appears to be somewhat higher for bromide than iodide perovskites here. Similarly, higher Urbach energies have previously been reported for MAPbBr 3
compared with MAPbI 3 , in accordance with larger energetic disorder in the former 62 . We also find that
Г 0
tends to be lower for the perovskites containing FA as the organic cation, which points to larger material uniformity as one reason behind this material’s recent success in the highest efficiency perovskite solar cells 2 , 7 . We may also compare these findings with those of other polar inorganic semiconductors for which Fröhlich coupling is known to be active.
Supplementary Table 1
provides a detailed literature survey of values established for
γ LO
in other inorganic semiconductors. It has been pointed out 17
that charge-carrier mobilities established for lead halide perovskites (typically ≤100 cm 2  (V s) −1 ) 15 , 17
are relatively modest compared with those achieved in high-quality GaAs despite the effective charge-carrier masses in perovskites being only slightly elevated above those in GaAs. The values of
γ LO ≈40 meV and
γ LO ≈60 meV we extract from our data for the respective iodide and bromide perovskites (see
Table 1 ) are somewhat higher than the range reported for GaAs (see comparison in
Supplementary Table 1 ), which may partly explain these discrepancies. However, they are significantly lower than those typically found in highly polar materials such as GaN and ZnO where they can be over an order of magnitude higher 28 . Further theoretical modelling of charge-carrier mobility in these systems based on our findings will most probably allow more quantitative explanations and predictions to be made. In summary, we have conducted an in-depth analysis of charge-carrier–phonon interactions in hybrid lead halide perovskites, considering the four currently most implemented organic and halide components in hybrid perovskite photovoltaics, which are FAPbI 3 , FAPbBr 3 , MAPbI 3
and MAPbBr 3 . Our analysis of the temperature-dependent emission linewidth of FAPbI 3
and FAPbBr 3
allowed us to establish that the Fröhlich interaction between charge carriers and LO phonons provides the dominant contribution to the predominantly homogeneous linewidth broadening in these hybrid perovskites at room temperature. We successfully corroborated our findings with DFT and many-body perturbation theory calculations, which underline the suitability of an electronic bandstructure picture for describing charge carriers in perovskites. We furthermore obtained experimentally measured energies of LO phonon modes responsible for Fröhlich interactions in these materials and showed that Fröhlich interactions are higher for bromide perovskites than iodide perovskites, providing a link between composition and electron–phonon scattering that fundamentally limits charge-carrier motion. These results lay the groundwork for more quantitative models of charge-carrier mobility values and cooling dynamics that underpin photovoltaic device operation. Methods Sample preparation All materials, unless otherwise stated, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and were used as received. Methylammonium iodide, methylammonium bromide, formamidinium iodide and formamidinium bromide were purchased from Dyesol. Thin films were prepared on Z-cut quartz substrates. These were initially cleaned sequentially with acetone followed by propan-2-ol, then treated with oxygen plasma for 10 min. MA perovskite films were deposited in a nitrogen-filled glovebox using a solvent quenching method wherein an excess of antisolvent is deposited onto the wet substrate while spin-coating 63 . A 1:1 molar ratio solution of MAX and PbX 2
(X=I, Br) was dissolved in anhydrous
N , N -dimethylformamide at 1 M. This was then spin-coated onto the quartz substrates at 5,000 r.p.m. for 25 s. During spin coating, after 7 s an excess of anhydrous chlorobenzene was rapidly deposited onto the spinning film. After spin-coating, films were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. FA perovskite films were deposited using an acid-addition method to produce smooth and uniform pinhole-free films 6 . FAX and PbX 2
(X=I, Br) were dissolved in anhydrous
N , N -dimethylformamide in a 1:1 molar ratio at 0.55 M. Immediately before film formation, small amounts of acid were added to the precursor solutions, to enhance the solubility of the precursors and allow smooth and uniform film formation. Thirty-eight microlitres of hydroiodic acid (57% mass/mass) was added to 1 ml of the 0.55 M FAPbI 3
precursor solution and 32 μl of hydrobromic acid (48% mass/mass) was added to 1 ml of the 0.55 M FAPbBr 3
precursor solution. Films were then spin coated from the precursor plus acid solution on warm (85 °C) oxygen plasma-cleaned substrates at 2,000 r.p.m. in a nitrogen-filled glovebox and subsequently annealed in air at 170 °C for 10 min. PL spectroscopy Each sample was photoexcited by a 398-nm picosecond pulsed diode laser (PicoHarp, LDH-D-C-405M) with a repetition rate of 10 kHz and a fluence of 490 nJ cm −2 . The resultant PL was collected and focused into a grating spectrometer (Princeton Instruments, SP-2558), which directed the spectrally dispersed PL onto an iCCD (PI-MAX4, Princeton Instruments). The sample was mounted under vacuum ( P <10 −6  mbar) in a cold-finger liquid helium cryostat (Oxford Instruments, MicrostatHe). An associated temperature controller (Oxford Instruments, ITC503) monitored the temperature at two sensors mounted on the heat exchanger of the cryostat and the end of the sample holder, respectively; the reading from the latter was taken as the sample temperature. PL measurements were taken as the sample was heated in increments of 5 K between 10 and 370 K. Computational methods We carried out
ab initio
calculations on MAPbI 3
in the orthorhombic phase using the crystallographic data in ref.
35 . The ground-state electronic structure was computed within the local density approximation to DFT including spin–orbit coupling, as implemented in the Quantum ESPRESSO package 64 . We used norm-conserving pseudopotentials to describe the core–valence interaction, with the semicore
d
states taken explicitly into account in the case of Pb and I. Ground-state calculations were converged with a plane-wave cutoff of 100 Ry and a 6 × 6 × 6 unshifted Brillouin-zone grid. The electronic quasiparticle energies were calculated with the SS- GW
method described in ref.
65
using the Yambo code 66
and interpolated by means of Wannier functions as in ref.
55 , using wannier90 (ref.
67 ). This yields bandgap and effective masses in good agreement with experiment (see
Supplementary Note 1 ). The lattice dynamical properties were computed within density functional perturbation theory at the Г point, as in ref.
51 ). The LO–TO splitting was included through the evaluation of the non-analytic contribution to the dynamical matrix. The electron–phonon coupling was calculated using the EPW code 68 , 69 , v.4. The electron–phonon self-energy,
Σ n
k , was calculated as: Here,
and

ɛ n
k
and

v
is the energy of a phonon with wavevector

and polarization
ν , and
η
is a small broadening (10 meV in
Fig. 3a,b ; 1 meV in
Fig. 3d ). Only the interaction with the LO phonons was taken into account, by calculating the electron–phonon matrix element
as in ref.
70
(see
Supplementary equation (1) ). The self-energy in equation (2) was converged by using up to two million random
q
points in the Brillouin zone. The quasiparticle renormalization factor
Z
is defined as the frequency derivative: and is evaluated at the band edges. In the case of the conduction band edge, we find
Z =0.54 at zero temperature. Data availability The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author on request, as is the custom Matlab code used to analyse the PL data. The Quantum ESPRESSO 64 , Yambo 66 , wannier90 (ref.

Abstract The efficiencies of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are now reaching such consistently high levels that scalable manufacturing at low cost is becoming critical. However, this remains challenging due to the expensive hole-transporting materials usually employed, and difficulties associated with the scalable deposition of other functional layers. By simplifying the device architecture, hole-transport-layer-free PSCs with improved photovoltaic performance are fabricated via a scalable doctor-blading process. Molecular doping of halide perovskite films improved the conductivity of the films and their electronic contact with the conductive substrate, resulting in a reduced series resistance. It facilitates the extraction of photoexcited holes from perovskite directly to the conductive substrate. The bladed hole-transport-layer-free PSCs showed a stabilized power conversion efficiency above 20.0%. This work represents a significant step towards the scalable, cost-effective manufacturing of PSCs with both high performance and simple fabrication processes.

Introduction Since their first report in 2009, halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted enormous interest as emerging light-to-electricity conversion optoelectronic devices with both high efficiency and ease of solution processability 1 , 2 , 3 . To date, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of solution-processed PSCs have been certified at well above 20% 4 , 5 , 6 . However, all top-performing PSCs were fabricated by a spin-coating method which is unsuitable for high throughput and scalable module production. Several scalable film deposition techniques have been developed for PSC fabrication, such as doctor-blading 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , spray deposition 11 , slot-die coating 12 , solution printing 13 , and electrodeposition 14 . In particular, doctor-blade coating with a controlled substrate temperature has gained most success in depositing high-quality perovskite films with large grains and controllable optoelectronic properties 15 . Moreover, blade coating has great potential to be scaled up for roll-to-roll fabrication. Encouragingly, the PCEs of PSCs with bladed perovskite layers have steadily increased to above 19%, approaching the levels of their spin-coated counterparts 13 , 16 . A next step towards the scalable fabrication of PSCs is to coat the charge transport layers by scalable processes. However, the existing multiple-layer device structures, either p–i–n or n–i–p structures with a hole transport layer (HTL), perovskite, and electron transport layer (ETL), impose a great challenge on the scalable fabrication of PSCs in a cost-effective manner 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 . First, high-performance organic hole-transporting materials, such as 2,2′,7,7′-Tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), are much more expensive than perovskite materials. Second, for the devices with p–i–n structure, it is difficult to blade-coat perovskite films onto a hydrophobic HTL, e.g., poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine) (PTAA), while a hydrophilic HTL, e.g., NiO
x
, is difficult to form on plastic substrates at low temperature, nor can easily be coated at optimal thickness and electronic quality to achieve the highest device efficiency. Hence, we believe that the elimination of the HTL from the PSC device architecture can be an effective way to solve this challenge. By reducing one step of the standard coating process, at least one third of the manufacture cost and time can be saved, in addition to savings of material cost for the HTL. The reported ambipolar charge transport characteristics of halide perovskite materials endow them with great potential to construct PSCs with simplified device architecture, such as HTL-free PSCs with either conventional or inverted structure 21 , 22 , 23 . Yet, a critical challenge for HTL-free PSCs is the ineffective hole collection by indium tin oxide (ITO) because of mismatched work functions between ITO and the perovskite, which generally causes significant efficiency loss 23 , 24 , 25 . In addition, the construction of HTL-free devices by the blade-coating method faces more challenges due to rougher and more non-uniform perovskite films, than do those prepared by spin-coating with the anti-solvent method. Here we report a molecular-doping strategy for a perovskite layer to doctor-blade HTL-free PSCs with a simplified device structure of ITO/perovskite/ETL/Cu. Doping methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI 3 ) films with 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ), a strong electron-withdrawing molecule, leads to a modified ITO/MAPbI 3
interface with favorable band bending, which facilitates the extraction of photoexcited holes from perovskite to ITO electrode. Combining additive engineering and solvent annealing, high-quality MAPbI 3
films are obtained with full surface coverage, micrometer-sized grains, and improved crystallinity. By employing a bladed and doped MAPbI 3
film as the photoactive layer in a HTL-free device structure, a stabilized PCE over 20.0% with almost no
J–V
hysteresis is obtained. Results Perovskite films fabrication and molecular doping The MAPbI 3
perovskite films were directly deposited onto blank ITO glass substrates by a previously reported doctor-blading method 9 , which is schematically illustrated in Fig.  1a . Before blade coating, the ITO substrates were cleaned by a UV-ozone treatment to improve their wettability to perovskite solution 23 . MAPbI 3
precursor dissolved in N,N-diethylformamide (DMF) containing p-type dopant (F4TCNQ) was dripped onto substrates which were heated at 150 °C, followed by a quick blading process to spread the solution onto the substrates. After blading, the perovskite precursor solution dried in a few seconds, and the substrates were quickly removed from the hot plate and annealed at 100 °C for varied durations. The bladed perovskite films showed thicknesses of 500 ± 20 nm from cross-sectional imaging (Fig.  1b ) by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). To implement molecular doping of the perovskite layer, F4TCNQ with chemical structure shown in Fig.  1a
was dissolved in DMF separately, and then added to the as-prepared MAPbI 3
precursor solution. Perovskite films made without or with F4TCNQ were denoted as MAPbI 3
or MAPbI 3 :F4TCNQ, respectively. Fig. 1 Doctor blading and doping of perovskite films by F4TCNQ.

Schematic illustration of the energy diagram and electron transfer process for MAPbI 3 :F4TCNQ blends Full size image The doping of perovskite is expected to change the work function of the films. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) was used to determine the surface potential change of perovskite films upon F4TCNQ mixing. In addition to direct mixing of F4TCNQ and MAPbI 3
in precursor solution, MAPbI 3 :F4TCNQ was prepared by solid diffusion via heating F4TCNQ powder on MAPbI 3
and then removing the excess F4TCNQ. The topography and contact potential difference (CPD) images of pristine MAPbI 3
and MAPbI 3 :F4TCNQ films by either standard solution mixing or solid diffusion are shown in Fig.  1c–h . For better comparison, the three CPD images are flattened and presented in the same color scale, while the histograms of the absolute CPD values of the three types of films are plotted in Fig.  1i . The pure MAPbI 3
film has coarse grains and uniform CPD distribution (Fig.  1c, f ). In contrast, solution mixed MAPbI 3 :F4TCNQ film, in which uniform doping is expected, has fine grains and greater heterogeneity of the CPD distribution (Fig.  1d, g ). For the sample with solid-diffused F4TCNQ, some small F4TCNQ particles were placed on top of a MAPbI 3
film, and the CPD imaging was conducted around the edge (the green color line as indicated in Fig.  1h ) to include both neat and doped perovskite regions. Such method leads to a clear edge between diffused and undiffused regions that can be visualized in the CPD image (Fig.  1h ), thus the CPD heterogeneity is even higher. The change of absolute CPD caused by F4TCNQ doping is clearly demonstrated in Fig.  1i . A decrease of surface potential or in other words an increase of work function was observed for the MAPbI 3 :F4TCNQ films, irrespective of direct mixing or solid diffusion. The increase of heterogeneity for the MAPbI 3 :F4TCNQ films is also reflected in the broadening of the curves. This confirmed p-type doping of MAPbI 3
by F4TCNQ. Specifically, after the addition of electron-withdrawing F4TCNQ molecule to the MAPbI 3 , owing to the deep lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of F4TCNQ, electrons in the valance band of MAPbI 3
can be thermally activated into the LUMO level of F4TCNQ, which leaves holes in MAPbI 3
and thus causes its p-doping (Fig.  1j ). As a result, the hole concentration in the MAPbI 3
film increased. The carrier concentration change upon F4TCNQ doping has been evaluated by analyzing the dark capacitance vs. voltage ( C–V ) characteristics of the perovskite devices (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). Charge density profiles were extracted from the
C–V
curves using Mott–Schottky analysis 26 , 27 . The carrier concentration in the perovskite layer was calculated to be 0.6 × 10 16  cm −3
in the neat MAPbI 3
film which increased to 2.4 × 10 16  cm −3
after the addition of 0.03 wt% F4TCNQ. This molecular p-type doping strategy enabled the fabrication of an HTL-free PSC with a simplified device configuration but still effective p–n heterojunction (i.e., p-doped perovskite and n-type ETL), and thus enhanced device performance. Electronic properties of doped perovskite films The electronic properties of the MAPbI 3 :F4TCNQ films were investigated by comparing their current density–voltage ( J–V ) characteristics with pristine MAPbI 3
films deposited on glass substrates in the dark condition. The lateral conductivity was measured across gold electrodes spaced 100 µm apart (Fig.  2a ). As shown in Fig.  2b , the MAPbI 3 :F4TCNQ film exhibited a nearly tenfold increase in conductivity over the neat MAPbI 3
film, which confirmed that F4TCNQ doped MAPbI 3 . The charge transfer from MAPbI 3
to F4TCNQ is expected to cause quenching of photoluminescence (PL) from the MAPbI 3
layer, which was measured by using time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay for MAPbI 3
films deposited on glass substrates (Fig.  2c ). The MAPbI 3 :F4TCNQ prepared on glass substrate showed a PL lifetime of 65 ns, which is fourfold shorter than the PL lifetime of pristine MAPbI 3
film (268 ns) on glass. Fig. 2 Conductivities and photoluminescence lifetimes of neat or doped perovskite films.

MAPbI 3 :F4TCNQ film Full size image The relative large molecular size of F4TCNQ likely prevents its integration into the lattice of MAPbI 3 . Therefore, we speculate that F4TCNQ molecules most probably remain at the grain boundary (GB) regions of perovskite films and/or perovskite/electrode interfaces. To determine the lateral distribution of F4TCNQ molecules, the local dark conductivity at grains and GBs was measured using conducting atomic force microscopy (c-AFM). Figure  2d
illustrates the c-AFM setup, where the microscope tip was positioned at locations randomly chosen from topographic AFM images (Fig.  2e, g ). The tip bias was scanned in the range +2.0 to −2.0 V at a rate of 0.14 V s −1 . For the neat MAPbI 3
film, the dark currents were similar at the grain and GB regions (Fig.  2f
and Supplementary Fig.  2a, b ), which is in accordance with previous reporting 28 . In sharp contrast, the dark currents measured at the GB regions of the MAPbI 3 :F4TCNQ film were notably higher (Fig.  2h
and Supplementary Figs.  2c, d ), elucidating the remarkably improved conductivity at the GB region after molecular doping of MAPbI 3
by F4TCNQ. At the regions close to GBs, the F4TCNQ molecules and MAPbI 3
undergo charge transfer, leading to an increase in carrier density in MAPbI 3
and thus the enhanced dark conductivity 29 . Morphologies and crystallinities of perovskite films High-quality perovskite films with large grains, high crystallinity and complete surface coverage are also crucial to achieving high-performance HTL-free devices. The blending of F4TCNQ in the perovskite in a small percentage (ranged from 0.01 to 0.05 wt%) did not notably change the morphology and grain size of the perovskite films, as shown by the SEM images in Supplementary Fig.  3 , nor cause a drastic change of crystallinity, as shown by the XRD patterns of bladed MAPbI 3
films prepared with different amounts of F4TCNQ in Supplementary Fig.  4 . Accordingly, methylammonium hypophosphite (MHP) and methylammonium chloride (MACl) were introduced as additives to the precursor solution, and co-solvents (dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/ chlorobenzene (CBZ)) post-annealing process was also combined to achieve a high-quality and high-crystalline MAPbI 3
film (Supplementary Figs.  5 ,

and

for SEM images and XRD patterns of bladed MAPbI 3
films prepared with different amounts of MHP as well as using co-solvents annealing technique in the absence or presence of MACl) 9 , 10 , 16 , 30 , 31 . Figure  3a, b
show representative SEM images of the bladed perovskite films after optimization, which featured a uniform morphology that extended hundreds of micrometers. The perovskite domains were densely packed together, and without observable voids at domain boundaries (Fig.  3a ). It should be noted that these domains are not single crystalline grains. Each micrometer-scale convection domain was comprised of micro-sized grains ranging from 800 to 1700 nm (average above 1 μm, Fig.  3b ).

As illustrated in Fig.  3c , inverted HTL-free PSCs were fabricated with a device configuration of ITO/MAPbI 3 :F4TCNQ/ETL/Cu. The corresponding photovoltaic performances for PSCs based on different F4TCNQ concentrations have been displayed in the Supplementary Table  1 , which indicated the optimal F4TCNQ concentration was 0.03 wt%.

films and MAPbI 3 :F4TCNQ films (with 0.03 wt% F4TCNQ), with photovoltaic parameters summarized in Table  1 . The reference PSC without F4TCNQ (i.e., MAPbI 3 ) exhibited a poor PCE of just 11.0%, which is in accordance with that of most reported HTL-free PSCs 23 , 24 . Surprisingly, with the addition of F4TCNQ, notable concurrent enhancements of the
J sc ,
V oc , and FF have been achieved. The champion cell based on MAPbI 3 :F4TCNQ film achieved the highest PCE of 20.2%, with a
J sc
of 22.7 mA cm −2 , a  V oc
of 1.10 V, and a FF of 0.81. To the best of our knowledge, this is the record efficiency for the bladed PSCs in the absence of HTLs. For comparison, the PSC based on the PTAA HTL and undoped MAPbI 3
layer has been fabricated, which showcases a PCE of 19.5%, along with a
J sc
of 22.1 mA cm −2 , a
V oc
of 1.12 V, and a FF of 0.79. This result is in good agreement with our previous reports 8 , 9 , 16 . It is worth noting that the demonstrated HTL-free device showed similar or even better photovoltaic performance, highlighting the effectiveness of such a doping strategy for constructing high-performance PSCs with not only a simpler structure, but also less deposition steps and lower material cost. The
J–V
curves of MAPbI 3 :F4TCNQ-based device were measured in both reverse and forward scan modes at a scan rate of 0.1 V s −1 , and almost no hysteresis was observed (Supplementary Fig.  8 ). Figure  3e
shows the stabilized photocurrent density of this device as measured at 0.93 V, giving a stabilized PCE exceeding 20.0% under continuous light soaking. This high stabilized PCE output is among the best record for HTL-free PSCs, and is quite remarkable given that the device is prepared using a scalable fabrication method. Figure  3f
shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the champion device. The integrated
J sc
from the EQE measurement agreed well with the
J sc
values measured under AM 1.5 G one sun illumination (Fig.  3d ). The fabrication procedure was repeated to confirm the reliability and reproducibility of the results. The PCE histogram was collected from 30 independent cells (Fig.  3g ), revealing that more than 73% of the cells had PCEs above 18.0%, and more than 93% had PCEs higher than 17.0% under one sun illumination. A study of the stability for the devices with or without HTL has been conducted. The devices were stored under ambient conditions (where humidity and temperature were about 20% and 25 °C, respectively) without any encapsulation. As compared to the devices with HTL, the HTL-free device exhibits a slightly better stability, which maintained over 92% of its initial PCE after storage for 500 h (Supplementary Fig.  9 ). Table 1 Photovoltaic parameters of PSCs employing neat or doped perovskite layers under one sun light illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm −2 ) Full size table It is noted from Fig.  3d
and Table  1
that the almost twofold efficiency enhancement in the F4TCNQ-doped devices primarily originates from the remarkable FF increase. Further analysis of the
J–V
curves in Fig.  3d
revealed that F4TCNQ doping of the perovskite layer significantly reduced device series resistance ( R s ) from 25.6 Ω cm 2
for undoped device to 2.6 Ω cm 2
for doped device. The influence of
R s
on device FF has been well established in diode based solar cells 32 , according to the classical equation based on diode equation: $$I = I_{\mathrm{L}} - I_{\mathrm{0}}{\mathrm{exp}}\left[ {\frac{{q(V + IR_{\mathrm{s}})}}{{nkT}}} \right]$$
(1)
where
I
is the device output current,
I L
is the maximum light generated current,
I 0
is saturated dark current,
R s
is series resistance,
n
is ideal factor,
k
is Boltzmann constant,
T
is temperature. Assuming a diode ideal factor of 1, the FFs for the undoped and doped devices were calculated to be 53% and 83% from Eq. ( 1 ), which are very close to measured values of 56% and 81%, respectively. This indicates the increased FF for the devices with doped MAPbI 3
is mainly caused by the reduction of the series resistance. To find out the origin of reduced series resistance by F4TCNQ doping, energy level diagrams are constructed and shown in Fig.  4
for the perovskite/ITO interface with or without F4TCNQ doping. Here the energy levels were extracted from the literature for the films made with same composition and similar method 33 , 34 . For undoped MAPbI 3 , the Fermi level of pristine MAPbI 3
(nearly intrinsic) is slightly lower than that of ITO (−4.7 eV) 34 . The Fermi level lines up during contact formation and causes a downward band-bending in MAPbI 3 , which forms a barrier for hole extraction from MAPbI 3
to ITO (Fig.  4a ). This would also increase the possibility of charge recombination and increase series resistance at the ITO/perovskite interface. In contrast, the incorporation of F4TCNQ in the MAPbI 3
films turns the MAPbI 3
to more p-type, particularly at the interface of ITO and MAPbI 3 , which should avert band-bending direction (Fig.  4b ). This was confirmed by surface potential measurement that the F4TCNQ doping can increase work function of perovskite by ~0.1 to 0.2 eV (Fig.  1i ). As is shown in Fig.  4b , the F4TCNQ doping results in an upward band bending at the ITO/MAPbI 3 :F4TCNQ interface. In this case, the hole transfer from F4TCNQ-doped MAPbI 3
to ITO is thus facilitated, resulting in a reduced series resistance to increase FF 35 . Fig. 4 Interfacial hole transfer dynamics. Schematic illustrations of hole transfer at the
a
ITO/MAPbI 3
or
b
ITO/F4TCNQ-doped MAPbI 3
interface Full size image The diode Eq. ( 1 ) predicts that
R s
variation has no influence on device
V oc , while in our case, the F4TCNQ doping increased device
V oc
from 1.00 to 1.10 V. This discrepancy indicates there is another factor, in addition to
R s , which leads to the
V oc
enhancement. To find out the reason, a transient photovoltage spectroscopy (TPV) measurement was also carried out to understand the charge carrier recombination dynamics. As shown in Supplementary Fig.  10 , the MAPbI 3 :F4TCNQ-based PSC had a longer carrier lifetime (0.69 μs) than the reference device based on neat MAPbI 3
(0.30 μs) under one sun illumination. This result was consistent with the larger
V oc
for the device with doping. The observed carrier recombination lifetime enhancement could be a result of band-bending configuration change due to doping, though there may be other reasons that may also change the carrier recombination lifetime. For instance, for the device with undoped MAPbI 3 , the retarded hole extraction would increase the possibility of charge recombination, because they cannot be effectively extracted out. Discussion We demonstrated how molecular doping influences the series resistance and interfacial charge transfer within HTL-free PSC devices with or without F4TCNQ incorporated in the perovskite layer. In the absence of HTL, both the electrons and holes can transport to the ITO/perovskite interface and recombine there, leading to serious interfacial charge recombination and thus inferior charge collection 36 . In addition, the mismatched work functions between perovskite and ITO would induce an undesirable energy barrier that leads to inferior hole transfer. These situations are all very detrimental to device performance. Molecular doping of perovskite by F4TCNQ to some extent induces favorable interfacial band bending, which allows efficient transport of holes at ITO/perovskite interface (Fig.
4b ) 35 . Choosing an appropriate p-type dopant with proper molecular size and selected surface hydrophility with ITO substrate is promising to further improve the ITO/perovskite interfacial affinity. Owing to the larger molecular size of F4TCNQ than the interstitial sites in perovskite structure, the F4TCNQ concentrated at the grain boundary regions. The dopant assisted with charge dissociation and thus resulting in more balanced transfer of electrons and holes to their respective electrodes, which decreased the possibility of the charge carrier recombination. We found the charge trap density within MAPbI 3 :F4TCNQ-based PSC was even slightly smaller than its pristine MAPbI 3
counterpart (Supplementary Fig.  11 ). It has been demonstrated that the trap sites within the organic semiconductors can be reduced due to partial filling by doping, typically at very low doping levels 37 . In summary, an additive-assisted strategy for p-type molecular doping of solution-bladed perovskite films was demonstrated. F4TCNQ-doped MAPbI 3
films show increased electrical conductivity, especially at grain boundary regions, and increased charge carrier concentrations. The incorporation of F4TCNQ in perovskite layers could modify the ITO/perovskite interface with reduced series resistance, which could be attributed to the favorable interfacial band bending for facilitated hole transfer and extraction from perovskite to ITO. The simple but effective approach enabled the scalable fabrication of HTL-free PSC devices with a simplified device geometry. Molecular doping of perovskite film by F4TCNQ led to the considerable enhancement of photovoltaic performance from 11.0 to 20.2%. The MAPbI 3 :F4TCNQ-based device exhibited a stabilized PCE that exceeded 20.0% and negligible hysteresis. This effective doping strategy eliminates the HTL preparation step, thus simplifying the PSC fabrication process and reducing costs. Extending the application of this doping technique to a broader range of semiconducting materials will definitely benefit the construction of other high performance, printed optoelectronic devices. Methods Materials preparation Lead iodide (PbI 2 , 99.9985%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Methylammonium iodide (MAI) was purchased from Dyesol. MACl (98%), 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ, 97%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, anhydrous, 99.8%), DMSO (99.9%), acetonitrile (anhydrous, 99.8%) and CBZ (anhydrous, 99.8%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All chemicals were used as received without further purification. Device fabrication The ITO glass substrates were ultrasonically washed with deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol for 30 min successively. After drying, the cleaned ITO glass was treated by UV-ozone (UVO) for 15 min then used immediately for device fabrication. To form a perovskite precursor (1 M), an equimolar ratio of PbI 2
and MAI was dissolved in DMF with different amounts of MHP (0.075 wt% to 0.300 wt%), F4TCNQ (0.01 wt% to 0.05 wt%), and 0.5 wt% MACl (for chlorine-containing precursor) added as required. Specifically, to implement solution-processed molecular doping of the perovskite photoactive layer, F4TCNQ was dissolved in DMF separately, and then added to the solution of as-prepared MAPbI 3
precursor solution. Typically, MHP/DMF additive was used to increase grain size, improve perovskite film crystallinity, and surface coverage. The bladed coating of perovskite films was conducted in an N 2 -purged glovebox (below 1.0 ppm O 2
and H 2 O). The perovskite precursor solution (~5 to 10 μL) was dripped onto the ITO glass on a hot plate set at 150 °C, then swiped linearly by a glass blade at a speed of 0.75 cm s −1 . The as-prepared perovskite films were then annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. For solvent annealing, the perovskite films were annealed under a vapor of mixed DMSO/CBZ solvent (1:1 v/v) at 100 °C for 30 min according to a literature method 31 . Finally, C 60
(20 nm, Nano-C), bathocuproine (BCP, 8 nm, Sigma-Aldrich), and Cu electrode (80 nm) were sequentially deposited on the perovskite layer by thermal evaporation to form a complete PSC device. Device characterization SEM images were obtained with a Quanta 200 FEG environmental SEM. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were acquired by a Bruker D8 Discover Diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (1.5406 Å). PL spectrum was measured with a Horiba iHR320 Imaging Spectrometer at room temperature. A 532 nm green laser (Laserglow Technologies) with an intensity of 100 mW cm −2
was used as the excitation source. TRPL was obtained using the DeltaPro with a pulsed laser source at 406 nm (Horiba NanoLED 402-LH; pulse width below 200 ps, 20 pJ per pulse, ~1 mm 2
spot size), and the signal was recorded using time corrected TCSPC. c-AFM measurements were performed on an Asylum Research MFP-3D AFM using Pt-coated Si conductive probes (PPP-EFM, Nanosensors). The conductivity of perovskite films was measured by a two-electrode method on glass substrates. The
J–V
characteristics of the cells (voltage scanning rate 0.1 V s −1 ) and the steady photocurrent under maximum power output bias (0.93 V) were recorded with a Keithley 2400 source-meter under simulated AM 1.5 G irradiation by a Xenon lamp (Oriel 67005), which was calibrated by a silicon diode equipped with a Schott visible color KG5 glass filter. EQE was measured with a Newport QE measurement kit. The
J–V
and EQE measurements were conducted under ambient air conditions without encapsulation. A non-reflective shadow mask was used to define a 0.08 cm 2
active area of the PSCs. The series resistance ( R s ) is derived from the slope of the
J–V
curve at the open-circuit voltage point. TPV decay was measured under 1 sun illumination and recorded by a 1 GHz Agilent digital oscilloscope. Data availability The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.

Abstract
It is very significant to understand the formation of perovskite crystals from the precursor solution and construct high-quality films to achieve highly efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we have revealed a colloidal strategy to prepare compact monolayer perovskite films by controlling the size of colloidal clusters in the perovskite precursor. Under the action of the coordination interaction, the introduction of CH 3 NH 3 Cl (MACl) into the standard perovskite precursor significantly increases the size of colloidal clusters. Meanwhile,
N -dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is further employed to stabilize the characteristics of the colloidal clusters and improve the reproducibility of the anti-solvent method. The large colloidal clusters can be orderly arranged on the substrate by spin-coating to form intermediate phase monolayer films, which grow to form large grains with an average size of 3 μm. Due to the much lower trap-state density and higher crystallinity of the monolayer perovskite films, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.14% has been achieved. This study sheds light on the conversion mechanism of perovskite crystals from the colloidal precursor to solid films, and paves the way for further improvement of high-quality perovskite films that can lead to high performance devices.

Abstract
Metal halide perovskite solar cells are rapidly becoming increasingly competitive with conventional PV technologies. While their efficiencies have been often touted as exceptional, they have received a lot of criticism for an apparent lack of stability. This perspective describes some of the most pressing stability concerns facing perovskite solar cells, and describes some of the recent advances made in this area. We will demonstrate that the solutions to the areas of structural, thermal, and environmental stability are closely linked, and that rational design of the perovskite and careful encapsulation can result in efficient and stable perovskite solar cells. We will conclude with some very promising results, demonstrating perovskite solar cells passing an IEC damp heat stability test.

Abstract Photovoltaic devices based on hybrid perovskite materials have exceeded 22% efficiency due to high charge-carrier mobilities and lifetimes. Properties such as photocurrent generation and open-circuit voltage are influenced by the microscopic structure and orientation of the perovskite crystals, but are difficult to quantify on the intra-grain length scale and are often treated as homogeneous within the active layer. Here, we map the local short-circuit photocurrent, open-circuit photovoltage, and dark drift current in state-of-the-art methylammonium lead iodide solar cells using photoconductive atomic force microscopy. We find, within individual grains, spatially correlated heterogeneity in short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage up to 0.6 V. These variations are related to different crystal facets and have a direct impact on the macroscopic power conversion efficiency. We attribute this heterogeneity to a facet-dependent density of trap states. These results imply that controlling crystal grain and facet orientation will enable a systematic optimization of polycrystalline and single-crystal devices for photovoltaic and lighting applications.

Hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskites are a fascinating and highly promising class of materials for optoelectronic applications, since they are straightforward to fabricate 1 , 2 , 3
and have tunable direct bandgaps 4 , 5 , 6 . After only a few years of active research, polycrystalline thin-film perovskite photovoltaic (PV) devices 7 , 8 , 9
have reached power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 22% (ref.  10 ) and have potential applications as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) 8 , 11 , laser gain media 12 , and photodetectors 13 . For PV devices, the rapid increase in PCE is astounding, considering that the origins of the highly efficient photovoltaic effect, as well as efficiency loss mechanisms, are not fully understood. Systematic optimization of efficiency requires understanding these fundamental processes at their native length scales. Previous work on the macroscopic optoelectronic mechanisms revealed high charge-carrier mobilities 14 , 15 , 16
and long lifetimes 17 , suggesting homogeneous performance within the active layer 18 . At the nanoscale, studies of charge separation processes concluded that devices are analogous to p–i–n junctions 19 , 20 , and another study reported enhanced photocurrent along grain boundaries 21 . Recent studies found surprisingly strong inter-grain photoluminescence (PL) 22
and cathodoluminescence 23
heterogeneity, which suggests that optoelectronic properties, such as open-circuit voltage ( V OC ), may also exhibit strong local variations 24 . These results highlight the pressing need to study local PV characteristics, such as
V OC
and short-circuit current ( I SC ), to understand the factors affecting efficiency in these systems. However, while inorganic and polymer PV materials have been studied on the nanoscale using scanning probe techniques 25 , 26 , 27 , no studies have yet determined the governing optoelectronic properties for perovskite PV devices at their native length scales (10–100 nm) or what limits their efficiency. Here, we locally probe and map the parameters that determine PV device performance— V OC ,
I SC , and dark drift current ( I D )—close to their native length scales. This was accomplished by employing a customized conductive atomic force microscopy (cAFM) technique to provide insight into these critical PV performance-determining parameters with nm-scale resolution. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations on perovskite electronic structure were carried out to support the interpretation of experimental data. We find significant intra-grain heterogeneities, which arise from facet-dependent variations of surface defect states that strongly impact device-level PCE. As a result, the macroscopic PV and LED performance of lead halide perovskites could be optimized by controlling the crystal orientation and facets at interfaces for both polycrystalline and single-crystal devices 16 . Photocurrent microscopy to probe local efficiency We used two sets of methylammonium lead iodide chloride (MAPbI 3− x Cl x ) thin films, which were processed in parallel. One set was used to fabricate planar solar cells by depositing a hole transport layer (HTL, spiro-OMeTAD) and a gold top contact, resulting in an average PCE of 15.7% ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). The second set was used as a half-cell for scanning probe analysis, omitting the HTL and top electrode to directly access the bare MAPbI 3− x Cl x
surface. The large surface roughness of the perovskite material, together with strong tip–sample interactions, pose significant challenges for reproducible cAFM using contact mode scanning ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Hence, we employed a modified cAFM technique in which, at each pixel, the tip approaches the surface, measures the photocurrent, retracts from the surface and moves to the next pixel, as shown in
Fig. 1a . In contrast to conventional cAFM, this technique eliminates friction, which reduces tip–sample deterioration and material transfer, and maintains a constant contact area while measuring current.
Figure 1b
shows a representative topography measurement of the MAPbI 3− x Cl x
surface; the average surface roughness is 19.1 nm and grain size is 142 ± 38 nm. Figure 1: cAFM experiment on the surface of a MAPbI 3− x Cl x
solar cell. a , The entire sample surface is illuminated while a conductive AFM tip measures the photocurrent. Bias is applied to the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrode and current is collected through the platinum-coated AFM tip at virtual ground. The arrows describe the approach–retract scan mode in which the tip approaches, measures, and retracts at each pixel, thereby minimizing potentially damaging tip–sample interactions.
b , A representative topography image of a MAPbI 3− x Cl x
thin film illustrates the large surface roughness. The scale bar is 1 μm. Full size image I SC ,
V OC
and
I D
were measured in this order on MAPbI 3− x Cl x
solar cells under appropriate illumination and bias conditions:
I SC
under illumination at 0 V;
V OC
relative to a reference bias under illumination at forward reference biases between 0.1 and 0.7 V; and
I D
in the dark at 2 and 3 V forward bias. The
V OC
is segmented relative to an applied reference bias. That is, when the photocurrent measured by cAFM is negative, positive, or approximately zero, the
V OC
is less than, greater than, or approximately equal to the applied reference bias. This method of characterizing
V OC
was chosen because alternative techniques, such as collecting local current–voltage curves or scanning potentiometry maps, do not provide reproducible results on hybrid halide perovskites (see
Supplementary Note 1 ). It is important to note that the conditions used to map
I SC
and
V OC
mitigate ion migration 28
because the tip is in contact with the sample for less than 2 ms, while electrical current from analogous macroscale devices is stable for at least hundreds of seconds (see
Supplementary Note 2
and
Supplementary Figs 4 and 5 ). Furthermore, we note that the maximum internal electric field is actually given by the built-in field at zero bias and is reduced as the tip bias approaches
V OC . The topography image in
Fig. 2a
displays individual crystal grains and various crystal facets within these grains. The range of different grain shapes observed in the topography image is due to the lack of preferential grain orientation in these MAPbI 3− x Cl x
films, as we have shown in a previous study using X-ray diffraction 3 . These measurements are reproducible ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ) and free of artefacts from topography and tip–sample interactions, as we illustrate in detail in
Supplementary Note 3 . Figure 2: Intra-grain heterogeneity of
I SC ,
V OC , and efficiency indicator. a , Topography image corresponding to all current maps. Individual crystal grains and their facets are clearly visible. The scale bar is 500 nm.
b ,

I SC
maps were measured on samples that included a thin HTL layer of spiro-OMeTAD on the MAPbI 3− x Cl x
( Supplementary Fig. 10 ).
c , Segmented
V OC
map measured under illumination relative to a forward reference bias of 0.6 V. Grey areas have
V OC
close to the reference bias, white areas above and black areas below.
d , To compare heterogeneity of
I SC
and  V OC
to facets, areas in blue (high
V OC
and  I SC ) and areas in red (low
V OC
and  I SC ) are overlaid on the local topography, indicating that many grains have a specific crystal facet that provides higher performance. For enlarged images with marked grains see
Supplementary Fig. 19 . Full size image Surprisingly,
I SC
and
V OC
( Fig. 2b,c ) show not only strong local inter-grain but also intra-grain heterogeneity, which appear to be associated with the facets of individual grains. The photocurrent varies by up to an order of magnitude within individual grains ( I SC
map
Fig. 2b ). Importantly, we find that the average
I SC
for individual grains does not depend on grain size ( Supplementary Fig. 7 ). This result contrasts with that of Nie
et al. 29
and suggests that grain-size-dependent
I SC
may be different for the regime studied here, in which the grain size is smaller than the
∼ 1 μm carrier diffusion length 14 . To ensure that the measured heterogeneity is not due to tip–sample interaction artefacts, we verified that
I SC
was not correlated with crystal height, different regions of constant topographic slope, or lateral and adhesion forces ( Supplementary Fig. 8 ). The
V OC
map shown in
Fig. 2c
also reveals intra-grain heterogeneity. This segmented map was obtained by measuring current at a forward reference bias of 0.6 V, which is near the macroscale
V OC
(0.51 V) obtained on a device with a Pt top contact in place of the HTL/Au to mimic the Pt cAFM tip–sample contact. As a result, all
V OC
values in the map are reported relative to the applied 0.6 V reference bias, as described above. As in the case of
I SC , the observed variation of
V OC
is most pronounced within individual grains, rather than between different grains. As a metric for local PV performance, we define the efficiency indicator, which is assigned as ‘high’ in regions having a combination of high
V OC
and
I SC
and ‘low’ in regions of low
V OC
and
I SC . Note that, contrary to PCE, this efficiency indicator does not contain the fill factor. We could not make quantitative PCE maps, since this would require current–voltage curves at each pixel, for the experimental reasons described above. The efficiency indicator map in
Fig. 2d
was generated by overlaying topography, in grey scale, with pixels representing high efficiency in blue ( V OC
> 0.6 V and
I SC
> 12 pA) and low efficiency in red ( V OC
≤ 0.6 V and
I SC
< 5 pA). Considerable intra-grain heterogeneity can be seen. To exclude tip–substrate effects as a cause for the heterogeneity, we repeated
I SC
and
V OC
scans over the same region and observed no change in the heterogeneity; used tips of different materials and observed similar heterogeneity ( Supplementary Fig. 9 ); and performed cAFM experiments on samples following deposition of a thin HTL layer of spiro-OMeTAD on the MAPbI 3− x Cl x
( Supplementary Fig. 10 ) and observed again similar heterogeneity in
I SC . These tests clearly indicate that the observed spatial variation is an inherent feature of these PV devices and not an artefact of interactions between the tip and the sample material. Grain facet-dependent heterogeneity
The observed intra-grain heterogeneity in
I SC ,
V OC
and efficiency indicator maps appear to be facet dependent when compared to the topography map. To test this observation statistically, the variance of
I SC
within facets was determined and compared to the
I SC
variance of facet-sized areas that were randomly placed over the
I SC
map. The facets were identified by calculating the azimuthal gradient from the measured topography image ( Fig. 3a ), as shown in
Fig. 3b . From the gradient image, the facets were individually identified on the basis of their constant gradient using segmentation and watershed algorithms ( Supplementary Fig. 11 ). The variance of
I SC
values within each facet was calculated, and then averaged, yielding a mean of variances of 5.69 pA 2 . Details of the variance calculation are available in the
Supplementary Methods . To determine the significance of this mean value, the same calculation was performed on randomly selected areas of the
I SC
map that mimic the number and size of the identified facets. This process of randomly selecting areas was completed 2,000 times to generate the histogram of the mean of current variances shown in
Fig. 3c , with the majority of randomly placed areas exhibiting a mean variance of 7.5 pA 2 . Since the current within the crystal facets has a mean variance significantly lower than the range of mean variance for randomly selected areas, the correlation of
I SC
heterogeneity with the crystal facets is statistically confirmed ( p -value = 0.02). The same calculation was performed on another set of topography and
I SC
images for MAPbI 3− x Cl x , and again the mean current variance for the facets was significantly less than for randomly selected areas ( Supplementary Fig. 12 ). From this analysis, we conclude that the intra-grain variations in
I SC
and
V OC
are indeed facet dependent. Figure 3: Facet-dependent
I SC
heterogeneity. a , Topography image in same area as
Fig. 2a . Grains are easily distinguished, but facets are more difficult to identify. Scale bar is 1 μm.
b , Azimuthal gradient image calculated from the topography image. Facets (areas of constant slope) are clearly identified in the gradient image.
c , Histogram of the mean of the
I SC
variances calculated for 2,000 sets of randomly placed squares that mimic the size and number of the identified facets in the gradient image. The red dashed line at 5.96 pA 2
is the mean of the
I SC
variances within the identified facets. Based on the histogram, it is statistically unlikely that the mean of the current variances in the facets is random; the
p -value is 0.02. See
Supplementary Methods
for details of gradient identification and mean variance calculation. Full size image While the
I SC
heterogeneity on the length scale probed here might be partially compensated by long charge-carrier diffusion lengths,
V OC
inhomogeneity is the performance-determining factor for macroscale solar cells: MAPbI 3− x Cl x
grains can be approximated as individual PV elements wired in parallel, where the lowest
V OC
will significantly reduce the macroscopic
V OC
(refs  19 , 30 ). If simply considering two adjacent grains, charges will flow from the high- to the low- V OC
grain, reducing the overall
V OC . Hence, we investigated
V OC
variation in more detail by collecting consecutive photocurrent maps of the same area at forward reference biases from 0.1 to 0.7 V, with increments of 0.1 V, shown in
Fig. 4a . These images were aligned, and the voltage values assigned based on two factors: if the photocurrent is approximately zero,
V OC
is set equal to the applied reference bias. If the current switches from positive ( V OC
higher than applied bias) to negative ( V OC
lower than applied bias) from one map to the next,
V OC
is between the two bias values. Values of
V OC
above 0.7 V are marked in white. Some areas are likely to have a higher
V OC
than 0.7 V, but we were not able to measure consecutive photocurrent maps for an applied bias range greater than 0.1 V to 0.7 V without tip modification. Any tip modification can change the tip–substrate contact area and tip work function, making quantitative current and voltage comparisons unreliable. We find a surprisingly large local variation in
V OC —over a range of 0.6 V—that has a dramatic impact on the macroscopic
V OC
and, hence, PCE. Again, the variation in
V OC
is correlated with the crystal facet that is being measured ( Supplementary Fig. 13 ). Figure 4: Heterogeneity in
V OC
and its correlation to
I SC . a , Local

values to individual pixels. The scale bar is 500 nm.

V OC

I SC . Inset: Area histogram of
V OC
intervals. Full size image The spatial correlation between
V OC
and
I SC
indicated in
Fig. 2
becomes more apparent when the full
V OC
range map in
Fig. 4a
is compared to the
I SC
map for that area ( Supplementary Fig. 13 ), as illustrated in
Fig. 4b . Higher
V OC
correlates with higher
I SC . Approximately 5% of the measured area was non-functioning with zero
I SC
and
V OC , while 35% of the area produced
V OC
greater than 0.7 V, suggesting that the efficiency in those areas is very high. If one were to assume a uniform fill factor, and gauge PCE only by the product of
V OC
and
I SC , high efficiency facets would perform up to 50% better than average, which would mean that some grains with specific facets could approach the theoretical PCE limit. So far, we have not been able to specifically index the high- and low-efficiency facets: electron backscatter diffraction mapping gave no meaningful results on facet orientation due to damage from the electron beam. Furthermore, spatially resolved elemental analysis by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and by scanning Auger microscopy ( Supplementary Fig. 14 ) failed to find differences in chemical composition, with no detectable trace of chlorine across the surface, consistent with prior reports 31 , 32 , 33 . We considered a range of hypotheses to explain the observed heterogeneity, but most could not describe the experimentally observed facet dependence (see
Supplementary Discussion ). However, we note that recent findings from deQuilettes
et al. 22
showed that inter-grain variation of PL intensity and lifetime are due to variations in trap state concentrations and that the traps can be passivated by surface treatment. Because PL efficiency is related to
V OC
(ref.  24 ), we hypothesize that our observed intra-grain heterogeneity in
V OC
is a consequence of variations in trap state concentrations among crystal facets: a high density of trap states lowers
V OC
due to Fermi level pinning and reduces
I SC
due to higher recombination rates. This hypothesis is further supported by Noel
et al. 34
showing that surface passivation enhances
I SC ,
V OC , and fill factor in PV devices equivalent in material and performance to those studied here. The simultaneous negative effect of trap states on
V OC
and
I SC
explains the strong spatial correlation we observe. Facet impact on internal electric fields and drift current To confirm that the observed heterogeneity in
V OC
and
I SC
is not related to differences in mobility, we mapped the local drift current ( I D ), which is proportional to mobility. We also note that
I D
is an important parameter for LED applications. The
I D
maps at 2 V and 3 V applied bias in
Fig. 5a,b
show that there is greater heterogeneity at 3 V compared to 2 V. An applied bias above 2 V provides sufficiently large electric fields across the perovskite film to ensure that current is dominated by electronic transport ( Supplementary Fig. 15 ) rather than recombination at trap states 19 , 35 , 36 . The
I D
map at 2 V shows very little heterogeneity throughout individual grains and between grains, which indicates a relatively constant mobility at these length scales and bias conditions. This observation indicates that variations of mobility are not the cause of the
I SC
and
V OC
heterogeneity. However, at 3 V forward bias the heterogeneities become much more pronounced and reveal a reoccurrence of facet-dependent heterogeneity ( Fig. 5b ). To ensure reproducibility, we measured at 2 V, 3 V, and back to 2 V, showing no difference in the 2 V
I D
maps or topography ( Supplementary Fig. 16 ). Figure 5: Heterogeneity in drift current due to changes in effective mass. a , Dark drift current ( I D ) map measured at a forward bias of 2 V indicates homogeneous electrical transport within grains. The scale bar is 500 nm.

map measured at a forward bias of 3 V and in the same area reveals significant heterogeneity. The scale bar is 500 nm.
c , Histogram of the relative drift currents at each pixel within a representative grain measured at 2 and 3 V, showing increased heterogeneity at 3 V.
d , Application of sufficiently high electric fields results in alignment of the MA molecules along the electric field direction and a displacement of the Pb cations relative to I 6
octahedra. Grey, green, black, light blue, and white spheres represent Pb, I, C, N, and H atoms, respectively. The MA molecules are aligned in parallel at an alignment angle of α = 180 ∘ . Enlarged images of these effects in
Supplementary Fig. 20 .
e , The electron and hole effective masses increase as both the Pb ions are displaced and as the MA become more aligned with the electric field. The effective mass can increase by up to a factor of 1.8, depending on the electric field direction. Full size image The enhancement of
I D
heterogeneity when moving from 2 to 3 V forward bias is illustrated in a histogram where the number of pixels is plotted versus the relative drift currents for an individual grain ( Fig. 5c ). The blue histogram represents
I D
at 3 V, the red histogram at 2 V. Due to the difference in
I D
magnitude measured at 2 and 3 V, the current values in the histograms are shifted and normalized to the respective mean currents and the histogram amplitudes are normalized to unity for easy comparison. The
I D
histogram at 3 V (blue) is very broad, with
I D
values ranging over an order of magnitude for different pixels. It shows two distinct peaks at −0.22 and −0.15 nA, which stem from two different facets within one grain, with one facet allowing 1.5 times higher
I D . In contrast, the 2 V histogram (red) is narrow and has only one peak at −65 pA, representing the spatial homogeneity of the measured mobility. Previously, ion migration was observed at comparable applied electric fields, which was indicated by modification of the topography 37 . However, due to our measurement technique, the sample is exposed to the maximum electric field for only 1.6 ms—too brief for ion migration 28 —when the tip is on the sample surface. The field is one order of magnitude lower during the next 10 ms, when the tip retracts, moves to the next pixel, and re-approaches. Based on the Einstein relation, which describes ion motion under an external force, and a diffusion coefficient of 10 −12  cm 2  s −1
(ref.  38 ), iodine ions will drift only 0.062 nm under a bias of 3 V across a 300 nm film over 1.6 ms. Hence, we would not expect topographic or
I D
modification for biases up to 3 V, consistent with our observations. We did not apply a bias over 3 V due to modifications in sample morphology at higher bias. While the
I D
homogeneity at 2 V supports the hypothesis that facet-dependent surface defect state concentrations give rise to local PV performance differences, the question remains: what causes the appearance of facet-dependent heterogeneity of
I D
at higher bias? To address this question, we investigated the effect of large electric fields on the electronic structure of lead halide perovskites using first-principles DFT calculations including spin–orbit coupling (SOC). For electric fields larger than
∼ 10 5  V cm −1 , corresponding to 3–4 V across our thin films, we find that the methylammonium (MA) ions align with the electric field (see
Supplementary Methods ). This alignment is accompanied by displacements of the Pb ions relative to the I 6
octahedra in each unit cell, leading to an overall polarization of the crystal lattice ( Fig. 5d ) 39 , 40 , 41 , 42 . As shown in
Fig. 5e , this polarization results in an increase in the effective mass of electrons and holes along the direction of the electric field by a factor between 1.3 and 1.8 for the three directions of MA alignment examined. Assuming a constant charge density,
I D
is proportional to mobility and, thus, inversely proportional to the reduced effective mass, which increases under sufficiently large electric fields according to our DFT calculations. The internal electric field in MAPbI 3− x Cl x
films is approximately equal to ( V app
−
V OC )∕ d , where
V app
is the applied forward bias and
d
is the film thickness. Hence, we suggest that at a bias of 3 V, only facets with low
V OC
(higher trap state density) have an internal electric field sufficiently high to induce complete MA alignment and the corresponding polar Pb and I displacements. The 1.3 to 1.8 times increase in effective mass, as predicted by our calculations, explains the experimentally observed reduction in
I D
of 1.5 times between different facets on the same grain. On facets characterized by high
V OC , the internal electric fields do not surpass the necessary threshold, and the mobility remains high. This model explains the facet-dependent heterogeneity in
I D
at large bias and its spatial correlation with
V OC
( Supplementary Fig. 17 ). We did consider other hypotheses to describe the heterogeneity at high bias, such as variations in carrier concentration, scattering time, and ion migration, but our model based on the DFT calculations provides the best agreement with the experimental results (see
Supplementary Discussion ). Ion migration may influence the measured magnitude of
I D , but its effect is probably very small ( Supplementary Fig. 16 ). Facets with high trap state density can modify local
I D , an important insight for LED operation. Conclusion
In conclusion, we show significant intra-grain heterogeneity in short-circuit current, open-circuit voltage, and high bias drift current, as well as spatial correlation between these parameters, in state-of-the-art MAPbI 3− x Cl x
solar cell materials. The intra-grain heterogeneity in
V OC
and
I SC
is indicative of facet-dependent defect concentrations in these polycrystalline films.
V OC
heterogeneity has a direct effect on macroscale solar cell performance, but can also indirectly affect mobility due to local polarization at high forward bias, which might also impact LED applications. Based on these results, the efficiency of single-crystal and polycrystalline halide perovskite solar cells and LEDs can be systematically improved by controlling the growth direction of the grains and the orientation of the facets at interfaces with electron and hole conducting layers, as well as by chemical passivation of interfacial defect states. We are currently working toward growing high-quality MAPbI 3− x Cl x
films with different preferential crystal orientations to measure changes in heterogeneity with cAFM for correlation with macroscopic PCE. Our findings described here suggest that reproducible performance of devices at the scale of individual grains will rely on control of facet-specific defect properties. Methods Conductive atomic force microscopy. cAFM allows for the simultaneous measurement of current and topography. Measurements were performed using a Park Systems NX10 AFM encased in a nitrogen-filled glovebox to prevent sample degradation. Samples can be stored at least one week in the nitrogen atmosphere without degradation. All measurements were conducted with relative humidity less than 1%. The gentle PinPoint mode was the key to acquiring reproducible and reliable topography and cAFM images on the rough MAPbI 3− x Cl x
surfaces: the tip approached over a period of 5 ms to achieve an interaction force of 2 nN, the force was held constant while the current was sampled 80 times at 50 kHz, then the tip retracted over a period of 5 ms ( Fig. 1a ) and moved to the next pixel. The height at constant force is also recorded to generate a simultaneous topographic image. This method differs significantly from tapping mode because a contact mode tip is used, the tip is not oscillating, and the tip retracts and approaches at each pixel rather than adjusting the tip height to maintain a constant oscillation amplitude. This scan mode does require more time (approximately 2 h for a 512 × 512 pixel image), but results in highly reproducible images. The drift on our Park NX10 microscope was typically 10 nm h −1
in equilibrium ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ), and successive current scans were digitally aligned using the topographic image channel; thus, drift did not complicate interpretation of the results presented here. We chose these approach–retract conditions to achieve reproducible photocurrent measurements and to avoid effects of ion migration 28
(see
Supplementary Notes 2 and 3 ) since the tip is in contact for less than 1.6 ms with the sample—too fast for ion migration to play a role. In our cAFM set-up, the bias is applied to the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrode, while the Pt tip is at virtual ground. The current is measured directly after the tip using a preamplifier with a gain of 10 10  V/A. Because of this electrical configuration, negative voltage forward biases the cell and
I SC
has a positive value. Short-circuit current density ( J SC ) values were not calculated for the nanoscale measurements, because determining the contact area between the AFM tip and the sample at each pixel would be a gross approximation. For the photocurrent maps, the sample is illuminated from above with a white LED having an output from 375 to 800 nm and an integrated power density of 2.73 mW cm −2
(see
Supplementary Fig. 18
for the spectrum). Since initial light exposure modifies the performance of lead halide perovskites, we light-soaked the samples for an hour before characterizing the local performance under steady state conditions. AdvancedTEC ContPt AFM probes (Nanosensors) were employed because the tetrahedral tip protrudes from the end of the cantilever, which provides direct optical access to the point of contact between the tip apex and the sample (see
Supplementary Methods ). Shading of the sample by the cantilever was also prevented by using a 0.4 numerical aperture objective, which focuses the light with a 24-degree half-angle. These tips have a 25 nm radius of curvature and a 0.2 N m −1
force constant. Many tips were used to ensure that the tips were sharp and not contaminated by material from the perovskite surface. As soon as any tip modification was observed, we exchanged the tip. Data taken while the tip apex was modified were not considered for analysis. Sample preparation and device performance. The two-step low-pressure vapour-assisted solution process to fabricate the MAPbI 3− x Cl x
is described as follows 3 . First, a PbI 2 /PbCl 2
solution is spin coated onto titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) coated FTO glass substrates. Second, the film is converted to MAPbI 3− x Cl x
by annealing the film in CH 3 NH 3 I vapour at low pressure for 2 h. This fabrication technique creates continuous films and reduced hysteresis effects in a planar PV device architecture. Planar solar cells with the structure FTO/dense TiO 2 /MAPbI 3− x Cl x /2,20,7,70-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)–9,9-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD)/Au have an average PCE of 15.7%,
V OC
of 1.0 V, and short-circuit current density ( J SC ) of 21.3 mA cm −2
(ref.  3 ). A representative current density–voltage curve is shown in
Supplementary Fig. 1 . For the cAFM measurement, the MAPbI 3− x Cl x
surface must be exposed to correlate morphology and current. To directly access the perovskite surface, the spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer (HTL) and Au contact are omitted and the Pt-coated AFM tip acts as the electrode. A macroscale solar cell with a structure mimicking the cAFM measurement (FTO/TiO 2 /MAPbI 3− x Cl x /Pt) has a
V OC
of 0.51 V and
J SC  of 16.2 mA cm −2
(see
Supplementary Fig. 4
for a representative current–voltage curve). The significantly reduced
V OC
is the result of removing the MAPbI 3− x Cl x /spiro-OMeTAD heterojunction, so only the TiO 2 /MAPbI 3− x Cl x
heterojunction contributes to the
V OC
(ref.  19 ). Python image analysis. The Python code utilizes the Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) binary descriptor to match objects in the images, and the RANSAC method is use to filter the matches to determine the transform 43 . Image registration allowed for careful comparisons of
I D ,
I SC
and
V OC
of the exact same region. To compare
I SC
to the grain size, we used the watershed method to identify crystal grains and calculate the average
I SC
per grain. First-principles calculations. To understand the consequences of internal electric fields on the atomic and electronic structure of (CH 3 NH 3 )PbI 3 , we perform first-principles DFT calculations including spin–orbit coupling (SOC). DFT calculations were performed using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange correlation functional 44
and the projector augmented wave (PAW) 45
formalism as implemented in the Vienna
ab initio
Simulation Program (VASP) 46 . The tetragonal phase is described by a
√ 2 × √ 2 × 2
unit cell with four formula units, corresponding to a total of 48 atoms. We performed geometry optimizations of three structures with parallel alignment of the MA molecules in [001], [100] and [111] directions, using a 4 × 4 × 4 Γ-centred
k -point mesh and an energy cutoff of 500 eV. Starting from experimental lattice parameters 3 , we performed full structural relaxations where lattice constants, and internal degrees of freedom were allowed to relax. No symmetry constraints were imposed in these calculations, and forces were converged until smaller than 0.01 eV Å −1 . Band structures were calculated from charge densities obtained using a denser 6 × 6 × 6 Γ-centred k -point mesh, including semi-core states and spin–orbit interaction. Total energies and lattice parameters of all structures that we considered are shown in
Supplementary Table 1 . From the band structures, we calculated the effective electron and hole masses by parabolic band fitting around the conduction band minimum (CBM) and the valence band maximum (VBM), respectively, along the crystallographic high-symmetry directions. In the main text, we report the factor by which the reduced effective mass changes along the direction of MA alignment, since we assume that transport takes place along the direction of the applied electric field. For example, we show the factor by which the reduced effective mass changes along the crystallographic [001] direction on aligning the MA ions along this direction. This factor is defined as
m α, ∗ 001 ∕ m α=0°,
∗ 001 , where
m α,
∗ 001
=
m 001 e m 001 h ∕( m 001 e
+
m 001 h ) is the reduced effective mass for alignment angle α, and
m 001 e
and
m 001 h
are the respective electron and hole effective masses along the crystallographic [001] direction. The effective masses of all structures that we considered can be found in
Supplementary Table 2 . See

Abstract
Halide perovskites are crystalline semiconductors gaining increasing attention as low-cost, high-performance materials for optoelectronics. Their processing from solution at low temperatures is compatible with rapid manufacturing of thin-film devices, including solar cells and light-emitting diodes. Therefore, understanding the coordination chemistry in metal halide perovskite precursor solutions would allow controlling the crystallization of thin films, their material properties and device performance. Here, we present a direct nanostructural technique to characterize the colloidal structure of perovskites in precursor solutions. Small-angle scattering is particularly adept for measuring nanoparticles in solution. Applying this technique to perovskite precursor solutions, we can study their colloidal properties. We show that not only do the colloids themselves matter, but also we can reveal their strong interactions in the early stages of crystallization. In particular, we focus on the prearrangement of particles into cluster-like formations. As an example, we present the concentration dependence, which is additionally supported using
207 Pb NMR.

1 Introduction The aim of a small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiment is to determine the shape and the organization, averaged in time, of particles or aggregates dispersed in a continuous medium. The term particle is applied to a wide range of objects, as for example, small colloidal particles (clay, ferrofluid, nanotube), surfactant aggregates (micelles, lamellar, hexagonal, cubic, or sponge phases), polymers and all derivatives, liquid crystal, model membranes, proteins in solution, flux line lattices in supraconductors. The list is not exhaustive. Small-angle scattering was discovered in the late 1930s by Guinier during X-ray diffraction experiments on metal alloys [ 1 ]. The main principles and equations still in use are exposed by Guinier and Fournet [ 2 ] in the very first monograph on SAXS. The development of SANS experiments started 30 years later, in the 1960s. The increase of interest was related to the pioneering work of Sturhmann et al. [ 3 – 5 ] where contrast variation experiments demonstrated that neutrons were a powerful tool to investigate materials. Indeed, the difference of scattering length densities between isotopes and more precisely between hydrogen and deuterium atoms is at the basis of most of the experiments. Moreover, neutrons are nondestructive and do not alter the samples as X-rays from synchrotron sources can do. The aim of the chapter is to give an overview of what small-angle neutron scattering is. In the first three sections, the experimental aspects will be explained with the description of a SANS instrument, the course of an experiment, and the data reduction. The two following parts will be dedicated to data interpretation and analysis. Basic rules of scattering will be recalled, useful equations of form factors will be given, and the instrumental resolution combined with polydispersity (variation in particle size) effects will be presented. This chapter will conclude with the recent advancements and future developments in SANS. 2 Description of SANS Instruments The two main sources of neutrons are steady-state reactors and spallation sources. In the first case, neutrons are continuously produced by fission processes. In the second case, a pulsed neutron beam (typically with 25 or 50 Hz frequency) is generated by the collision of high-energy protons which chop off heavy atoms. The time-of-flight method is used on the instruments to analyze the neutrons arriving on the detector. Consequently, the geometry and handling of SANS experiments depends on the kind of source. A world directory of SANS instruments is available on the web sites given in [ 6 ]. Technical descriptions of some of these instruments can be found in [ 7 ] as well. The spectrometers D22 (ILL, France) and LOQ (ISIS, UK) will be described as example for steady-state and time-of-flight instrument respectively. Then, D22 characteristics will be used to illustrate different sections of the article. 2.1 The Steady-State Instrument D22 A typical example of steady-state pinhole instrument is D22 at the Institut Laue Langevin, Grenoble. D22 was commissioned in 1995 and has been improved with the installation of a new detector in March 2004. The schematic layout of the instrument is given in
Figure
13‐1
. Figure 13‐1 Schematic representation the steady-state instrument D22 at the Institut Laue Langevin (figure courtesy of the ILL) Full size image
A white beam is produced by the horizontal cold source in the reactor. The wavelength is selected through a mechanical velocity selector (DORNIER), which consists of a rotating drum with helically curved absorbing slits at its surface. The wavelength can be varied between 4.6 and 40 Å when the rotation speed decreases from 28,000 to 4,000 rpm. The wavelength spread Δ λ/λ
is 10% (FWHM). The selector is mounted on ball-bearings and forbidden frequencies of rotation exist to minimize vibrations and resonance. Silver behenate, a polycrystalline powder giving narrow Bragg peaks is used as a standard to calibrate the wavelength. Several orders of Bragg peaks are obtained within few minutes, with a first order at
q
0
= 0.1763 Å −1 . The empirical relationship between the wavelength and the velocity or the RPM (revolutions per minute) follows: $$\lambda = {A \over {RPM}} + B$$
((1))
At the date of this review
A  = 121651 Å −1
and
B  = 0.1355 Å −1
on D22. After the selector, a set of vertical and horizontal slits are mounted. They define the size of the beam. The closure of the slits to reduce the beam size is used when a higher instrument resolution is necessary, for example, to study the shape of the Bragg peaks in flux line lattices. Then neutrons pass through a low efficiency detector, called a monitor. The integrated counts during the time the measurement are used for data normalization.
Collimation
is a series of waveguides necessary because unlike electromagnetic radiation (light or X-Ray), neutrons cannot be easily focused. The possibility of neutron lenses will be discussed in the last section dedicated to the new perspectives for SANS instruments. The collimation part on D22 is composed by eight guides with a cross-section of 55 × 40 mm 2 . Their lengths vary as a geometrical series to yield free flight paths of 1.4–17.6 m and are calculated in such a way that when one removes or adds a part of collimation the flux decreases or increases by a factor of 2. Antiparasistic diaphragms are placed between two guide sections. At the end of the collimation, the size of the beam in front of the sample is fixed by an aperture, made of B4C covered by Cadmium. Their shapes (round, slits, square) and sizes (from 1 to 20 mm) are very flexible depending on the sample geometry. The detector moves from 1.1 to 18 m from the sample position in a 2-m diameter tube under vacuum (0.2 mbar). The “beam-stop” made of an absorbing piece of B4C and Cadmium placed in front of the detector prevents the direct beam from damaging the detector. The possibility to offset the detector laterally up to 400 mm in the vacuum vessel allows one to cover a dynamic
q -range ( q
max / q
min ) of 20 with only one configuration. The detector rotation around its middle axis is also possible and useful at small detector distances ( D  < 2 m) to correct from geometric distortions (see  Figure
13‐5
). By combining the entire range of wavelengths and detector distances, the total accessible
q -range varies from 8 10 −4
to 0.8 Å −1 . D22 is located close to the brilliant horizontal cold source of the reactor. Thanks to the large cross-section of the neutron guide, the short rotor and high transmission of its velocity selector, the diffractometer D22 is up to now the one with the highest flux at the sample position with up to 10 8
neutron/s/cm 2 . 2.2 The Time-of-Flight Instrument LOQ The schematic geometry of the LOQ instrument is shown in
Figure
13‐2
. A description of the instrument is given in [ 8 ]. The white beam passes thought super-mirror Soller bender which removes wavelengths less than 2 Å, a first aperture, a disk chopper with variable openings, and a frame overlap mirrors to cut the wavelengths higher than 12 Å. The neutrons flight through a 3-m evacuated guide. A second aperture is placed at the end of the final collimation and defines the sample beam size. The sample position is at around 11.1 m from the moderator. The sample transmissions are measured by inserting a monitor just after the sample after reducing the beam diameter to 1 mm between the sample and the monitor. Figure 13‐2 Schematic representation of the time-of-flight instrument LOQ at the ISIS Facility, Didcot, UK (figure courtesy of ISIS) Full size image
The main gas-filled multi-detector is fixed at 4.1 m from the sample in a vacuum tube. The active area is 64 cm 2
with 128 × 128 pixels (5 mm resolution) and 100 time channels for the different wavelengths. The high
q
can be measured simultaneously using a second detector set at a fixed and close position to the sample. The principal benefit of conducting SANS experiments at ISIS is that a “white” incident beam is combined with time-of-flight detection techniques to give a very large dynamic range in scattering vector, accessible in a single measurement without any need to reconfigure the instrument. On LOQ at ISIS a pulse shaping 25 Hz disc shopper selects wavelength of 2.2–10 Å, which are used simultaneously by time-of-flight. For fixed geometry instruments working in time-of-flight mode, different wavelength neutrons scattered at a same angle have different
q
values and arrive on the detector at different times. The broader the incoming wavelength range, the wider the
q -range of the instrument. The data are saved in a 3D array with two dimensions for the pixels of the detector and the third for the time axis. The range of scattering vectors for time-of-flight instrument is similar to the range of steady-state instruments. The main advantage of time-of-flight instrument is that the full
q -range is covered by only one instrument setting. 2.3 Detectors for SANS Instruments Up to now, the most used detectors in SANS are gas proportional counters. Until the end of 2003, D22 was handled with the largest area multidetector filled with
3 He as detection medium and CF 4
as stopping gas. Technical data on neutron detection are detailed in [ 9 ]. The neutron absorption by a target isotope molecule ( 3 He) induces a fission reaction and emission of two charged particles, one triton and one proton, in opposite direction with a total kinetic energy of 760 keV which induces the primary ionization in gas. The stopping gas has two roles. First it reduces the path length of the electrons for a good position resolution and minimizes the wall effects. Secondly, in an environment of high photon background, it has a low sensitivity to gamma and X-rays. The electrons are accelerated to get more ionization and to amplify the signal. Near the anode wire, where the electric field is very high, the ions produced by the electron avalanche move away from the anode and induce a current in the cathode which is measured. On D22, the previous detector was composed by a network of 128 × 128 wires with a pixel size of 0.75 × 0.75 mm 2 . The advantages of gas-filled detectors are their high efficiency for thermal neutrons, around 80% at a wavelength of 6 Å and a low sensitivity to γ radiation. The maximal count rate is limited by the time to collect the charges and the electrons. The last developments on this field have permitted to decrease the dead time down to
τ  = 1 ns which represents a lost of 10% at 100 kHz count rate (neutron/s). Dead time correction is possible and strongly improves the data quality and curve overlapping. The two possible models are called paralyzable and nonparalyzable. The “real” count rate
C
real
is calculated from the measured count rate
C
mes
through the following relations. Nonparalyzable model: $$C_{{\rm{real}}} = {{C_{{\rm{mes}}} } \over {1 - \tau C_{{\rm{mes}}} }}$$
((2))
Paralyzable model: $$C_{{\rm{real}}} = C_{{\rm{mes}}} \exp \left( { - \tau C_{{\rm{mes}}} } \right)$$
((3))
The nonparalyzable model was used on D22 with the multiwire detector and is still in use for data correction on D11 (ILL). More details can be found in [ 10 ]. Example of determination of detector dead time is presented in
Figure
13‐3
. The measurement done on the multiwires gas-filled detector from D22, consists in measuring the attenuated direct beam through circular diaphragms and increasing progressively the surface of the beam at the sample position. The three attenuation factors are 147, 903, and 2,874. By considering a homogenous beam, the flux is proportional to the beam surface. The full lines are the data fitting with the nonparalyzable model, and the dotted lines are linear functions. The dead time
τ
is found at 0.91 ms, which corresponds to a lost 10% for a measured count rate of 100 kHz ( 2 ). Figure 13‐3 Dead time measurement on the gas-filled multiwire detector from D22. Flux measurement with factor of attenuation of: (◊)
F  = 147, (□)
F  = 902, (Δ)
F  = 2874. The dotted lines are linear functions and full lines the fitting with the nonparalyzable equation ( 2 ) Full size image
Since March 2004, a new detector is operating on D22. The new detector developed at the ILL by the detector group is a real-time neutron detector for small-angle scattering applications, which is capable of counting 2 MHz of neutrons on the whole detector with dead time losses of not more than 10%, rather than the 100 kHz for the previous detector. This detector is composed of an array of 128 vertical tubes of 8 mm external diameter and 102 mm length aligned side by side in a plan and brazed on both ends to a common pressure vessel. The sensitive area is 1 m 2 , with a pixel size of 0.8 × 0.8 mm 2 . The tubes are filled with
3 He and CF 4
at 15 bars. The thin resistive anode wire is tightened in the middle of the tube and relied on both sides of the amplifiers. The conversion of neutrons to electrons follows the processes described previously. The impact position along the tubes is now measured by charge division on the anode wire. Finally, each tube is an independent counter able to reach 80 kHz at 10% dead time correction. For very high count rates or localized spots due to pragg peaks for example, a dead-time correction per tube can be performed. More details are described in [ 11 ,
12 ]. For description of other neutron detectors, please refer to [ 9 ,
10 ,
13 ]. 2.4 Sample Environments The sample environment is easily versatile to match the various needs of the users. Most of the SANS instruments possess a remotely controlled thermostatted sample changer. Cryostats, cryofurnaces, furnaces, electromagnets are also available. A vacuum chamber can be used for very low scattering samples to reduce the scattering from air. The development of SANS experiments is strongly related to the development of new sample environments, to investigate properties of sample under nonsteady conditions. Shear apparatus, pressure cell, or stopped-flow apparatus are more and more used routinely. Special equipments may also be developed and designed by the scientist visitors (flash light [ 14 ], extruder [ 15 ], polarizer [ 16 ]) and adapted to the sample position. 3 Course of a SANS Experiment 3.1 Definition of the q-Vector The schematic representation of a small-angle scattering experiment is presented in
Figure
13‐4
. In an ideal case, the neutron beam can be viewed as an assembly of particles flying in parallel directions at a same speed. It can be described by a planar monochromatic wave which the propagation equation can be written as: $$\phi \left( {x,t} \right) = \phi _0 e^{ - i\left( {kt - \omega T} \right)}$$
((4))
\(\omega = {{2 \pi } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{2 \pi } T}} \right. } T}\)
is the pulsation and
k
i
is the incident wave vector; the magnitude is
\(k = {{2\pi } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{2\pi } \lambda }} \right. } \lambda }\) . An atom scattered in the beam gives raise to a spherical wave. In SANS, only the coherent elastic interaction between the neutron beam and the sample is considered. The only thing which changes is the direction of the wave vector
k
s
. The scattering vector (or wave vector or momentum transfer)
q
is the difference between incident and scattered wave vectors ( q = k
s
− k
i
). By definition, the angle between
k
s
and
k
i
is called 2 θ . The magnitude of
q
quantifies the lengths in the reciprocical space and is expressed in Å −1
or nm −1
$$q = {{4\pi } \over \lambda }\sin \theta .$$
((5))
If one introduces the latter equation in the Bragg law, one obtains: $$q = {{2\pi } \over d}.$$
((6))
This simple relation links the lengths in direct and reciprocical spaces and allows one to define the observation window during the experiment. Figure 13‐4 Schematic representation of a scattering experiment and representation of the scattering vector

The aim of the following section is to describe the experiment course step by step starting from the choice of the configuration up to the data acquisition. 3.2 Choice of Configurations and Systematic Required Measurements Before starting an experiment, it is necessary to think about the
q -range required and to optimize the configurations needed. By configuration one means the wavelength, the sample-to-detector distance
D , the collimation
C
and the detector offset (if possible on the instrument). In most of the cases the total
q -range offered by the instrument is not necessary, and the limited beam time allocated per experiment does not allow the users to investigate all the instrument possibilities. If the largest size
L
of scatterers is roughly known (from any other technique), an evaluation of the minimum
q
is obtained by
π/L . With a steady-state instrument, it is recommended if possible to keep the wavelength constant and to vary the sample-to-detector distance to cover the needed
q -range. This choice avoids repeating the transmission measurements and the calibrations that are wavelength-dependent. It also facilitates the data treatment. 3.2.1 Collimation The choice of the collimation distance is a compromise between the size of the direct beam (and thus the resolution, see
Section
6
) and the flux. Usually, a collimation distance matching the sample-to-detector distance is used. Nevertheless, for strong scatterer like water and/or short sample-to-detector distance, larger collimation distances can be used to reduce the flux and the scattering and to avoid detector saturation and damage. A frequently chosen set of configurations on D22 is:
λ  = 6 Å,
D  = 17.5, 5, and 1.4 with an offset of the detector of 400 mm to cover a
q -range from 2 10 −3
to 0.65 Å −1 . The beginning of an experiment for each configuration requires, the alignment of the beam-stop and measurement of beam center, electronic background, scattering of the sample empty cell and of a standard sample for absolute calibration. 3.2.2 Beam Center Determination An attenuator is set in the direct beam and the beam-stop is removed. The attenuated direct beam is measured through an empty position during several tens of seconds. The beam center of gravity is calculated with standard routines and further used for radial averaging. The integrated number of neutrons in the direct beam allows one to calculate the flux if the attenuation factor is known. 3.2.3 Beam-Stop Alignment The position of the direct beam on the detector varies with the sample-to-detector distance, the collimation, and in an important way with the wavelength since neutrons fall under gravity. Thus, the beam-stop position varies and the alignment has to be checked for each configuration, especially for large wavelengths and large sample-to-detector distances. A strong forward scatterer (teflon, graphite, etc.) allows one to clearly see the shadow of the beam-stop, which is correctly aligned when the same number of neutrons is counted on the beam-stop edges (or on the first significant channel). 3.2.4 Electronic Background The background is measured by stopping the incoming beam with a piece B4C or Cadmium, which are both strong neutron absorbers (but Cd creates gammas). In consequence what is measured on the detector comes from electronic noise, cosmic, and instrument environment. These backgrounds are generally low. Measurements are really important for weak scattering samples. 3.2.5 Standard for Calibration The use of a standard has two functions: correction of the variation in cell efficiency and normalization in absolute unit. Another possibility to get the absolute scaling is to use standards with known cross section [ 17 ,
18 ]. For SANS, samples with predominant incoherent scattering such as water (H 2 O) or vanadium are currently used for the absolute scaling. With an ideal detector, water shows a flat scattering independent from the scattering angle. The water scattering is not measured at large sample-to-detector distances and long collimation because the low flux would require several hours of acquisition to get a good signal to noise ratio. The normalization and correction of cell efficiency are done with a water run measured in another configuration but with the same wavelength. The correction of flux and solid angle is explained in the next section. It is recommended to perform the instrument calibrations and standard measurements at the beginning of the experiment. Indeed, in case of instrument failure, it will be nevertheless possible to treat the data recorded. 3.2.6 Transmission The sample transmission is the ratio between the flux through the sample and the incident flux at
q  = 0. The attenuated flux by the sample is measured in the same way and conditions as the direct beam. A transmission measurement lasts less than 5 min. 3.2.7 Counting Time For many samples, the scattering at large angles is strong but mainly due to incoherent scattering coming from the sample and the solvent, especially for hydrogenated solvent. Depending on the instrument and on the detector it is known that a certain total number of neutrons
N
T
on the whole detector area will give after the radial averaging (in case of isotropic scattering) a good statistics, i.e., small error bars and smooth shape of the curve. For example, on D22,
N
T
= 4,000,000 counts give good statistics. Short acquisitions of 10 s or less allow one to estimate the sample count rate c/s.
N
T
divided by c/s gives an estimation of the acquisition time. The development of new “intelligent program” able to stop an acquisition when a certain number of neutrons is reached on the whole detector or in a defined area will be discussed in the last section “future and development.” The relevant count rate is the difference of count rates between the sample and the solvent (mainly coming from incoherent diffusion). A too short measurement especially at high
q
where the coherent intensity decreases give large error bars on the absolute intensity and even negative values after subtraction of background and incoherent scattering. It is recommended to measure the solvent at large angles to have an experimental determination of the level of incoherent scattering. The number
N
T
is of course just an indication that must be modulated in function of the kind of information needed and also in function of the allocated beam time. It can be reduced if statistics is not really needed (for example, measurement of a slope) or increased in contrary if statistics is required (determination of a minimum, shape of Bragg peaks, etc.). 3.2.8 Command Files Once the previous steps have been done, the configuration settings and the acquisitions can be programmed in command files. 3.3 Conclusion The choice of the configurations may be a determining factor for further analysis and data fitting. It is a compromise between flux, resolution, beam time allocated, and number of samples. 4 From Raw Data to Absolute Scaling The instruments from different Institutes have developed data treatment programs, which can be adapted to other instruments after minor modifications for the reading of data and parameters. The principle remains similar. For the ILL SANS instruments see [ 19 ] for the standard programs in use. The different steps consist in:
Calculating the beam center for the different configurations used.
Creating mask files to hide cells behind the beam stop as well as potential “bad cells”
Calculating transmissions.
Performing radial averaging giving the intensity as a function of
q
in case of isotropic scattering. Depending on the programs, what is called “intensity” at this step can be a number of neutrons, or a count rate per second or per monitor unit.
The last step to obtain the absolute intensity is more delicate and its description is the aim of the following section.
(1) Note: The two last points can be performed in the reverse order. Absolute scaling can be performed on the 2D image, before radial or section averaging for anisotropic data. When a coherent beam with a flux
Φ
o
illuminates a sample of volume
V
and a thickness
e , during a time
t , a given fraction of the incident flux Δ N
is elastically scattered in the direction q within a solid angle ΔΩ: $${\rm \Delta} N = \Phi _0 tTr{{\rm d {\rm \sigma} } \over {\rm d {\rm \Omega} }}(q){\rm \Delta} {\rm \Omega} ,$$
((7))
where
Tr
is the transmission of the sample.
\({{{\rm{d}}{\rm \sigma} } \over {{\rm{d}}{\rm \Omega} }}(q)\)
is the differential scattering cross section characteristic of elastic interaction between sample and neutrons. Then the intensity
I
scattered per unit volume is $$I\left( {cm^{ - 1} } \right) = {1 \over V}{{{\rm{d}}{\rm \sigma} } \over {{\rm{d}}{\rm \Omega} }}(q) = {{{\rm \Delta} N\left( q \right)} \over {\Phi _0 Tr\left( {{\rm \Delta} {\rm \Omega} } \right).t.e}}$$
$$\left( {{{{\rm{d}}{\rm \Sigma} } \over {{\rm{d}}{\rm \Omega} }}} \right)_{\rm Total} = {{N\left( q \right)} \over {\Phi _o .{\rm \Delta} {\rm \Omega} \left( q \right).Tr.t.e}} = {1 \over {\Phi _o {\rm \Delta} {\rm \Omega} \left( q \right).Tr\left( q \right).t.e\left( q \right)}}I\left( q \right).$$
((8))
In soft condensed matter, the samples are generally filled in a quartz cell that contributes slightly to the general scattering. The scattering from the empty cell (EC) is subtracted from the total scattering as follows: $$\eqalign { \left( {{{\rm d {\rm \Sigma} } \over {\rm d {\rm \Omega} }}} \right)_{\rm sample} = & {1 \over {e_{\rm sample}}}\left[ {{{N_{\rm sample} \left( q \right)} \over {\Phi _{\rm{o}}.{\rm \Delta} {\rm \Omega} \left( q \right).Tr_{\rm sample} .t_{\rm sample} }} - {{N_{{\rm{EC}}} \left( q \right)} \over {\Phi _o .{\rm \Delta} {\rm \Omega} \left( q \right).Tr_{{\rm EC}} .t_{{\rm EC}} }}} \right]_{\rm sample} \cr = & {1 \over {e_{\rm sample}\Phi _{\rm{o}} }}\left[ {{{N_{\rm sample} \left( q \right)} \over { {\rm \Delta} {\rm \Omega} \left( q \right).Tr_{\rm sample} .t_{\rm sample} }} - {{N_{{\rm{EC}}} \left( q \right)} \over {{\rm \Delta} {\rm \Omega} \left( q \right).Tr_{{\rm EC}} .t_{{\rm EC}} }}} \right] }$$
((9))
(2) In the case of a solid sample, which does not necessitate a cell, the scattering from air has to be removed. The transmissions are calculated with respect to the empty beam. We now turn to the description, calculation, or measurement of the different terms of the previous equation. 4.1 Determination of the Incident Flux
Φ
0
In ( 7 ), the incident flux
Φ
0
is the number of neutrons per second at the sample position for a given aperture. The flux can be measured directly with a calibrated monitor installed at the sample position. The other possibility is to measure the direct beam on the detector through a calibrated attenuator. This approach calls Σ EB , the sum of neutrons integrated in the surface of the direct beam,
t
EB , the acquisition time, and
F , the factor of attenuation. Then, taking into account the detector dead time
τ
$$\Phi _0 \left( {n/s} \right) = F{{{{{\rm \Sigma} _{{\rm EB}} } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{{\rm \Sigma} _{EB} } {t_{EB} }}} \right. } {t_{{\rm EB}} }}} \over {1 - \tau {{{\rm \Sigma} _{{\rm EB}} } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{{\rm \Sigma} _{{\rm EB}} } {t_{EB} }}} \right. } {t_{{\rm EB}} }}}}.$$
((10))
Thanks to the development of new fast detectors like the one on D22 at the ILL, the dead time correction is not necessary in most of the cases. For classical gas detectors, the dead time is of the order of few tens of microseconds and corresponds to a lost of 10% of neutrons at count rates of 100 kHz. 4.2 Normalization with a Standard Sample Samples with predominant incoherent scattering such as light water (H 2 O) or vanadium are used for the absolute scaling and to correct the variations in efficiency of the cells. $$\left( {{{{\rm d} {\rm \Sigma} } \over {{\rm d} {\rm \Omega} }}} \right)_{{\rm{\rm sample}}} = {{I_{\rm sample} } \over {I_{{\rm{standard}}} }}\left( {{{{\rm d} {\rm \Sigma} } \over {{\rm d} {\rm \Omega} }}} \right)_{{\rm{standard}}}$$
((11))
A water sample of thickness
e  = 0.1 cm is frequently used as standard because water is easy to find, the liquid is homogenous at the scales of SANS, and the scattering is mainly incoherent. However, due to inelastic and multiple scattering effects, the water scattering is not totally isotropic, but stronger in the forward direction. The assumption that the neutrons that are not transmitted are scattered uniformly in 4π steradians is wrong. A wavelength-dependent correction factor
g ( λ ) has to be introduced to write the real scattering cross section $$\left( {{{{\rm d}{\rm \Sigma} } \over {{\rm d}{\rm \Omega} }}} \right)_{{\rm H}_{\rm 2} 0}^{{\rm real}} = g\left( \lambda \right){{1 - Tr} \over {4\pi .e.Tr}}.$$
((12))
In SANS there is no universal calibration curves. The water scattering measured on two instruments may vary significantly. Because of multiple scattering and inelastic effects, scattering depends on the wavelength distribution, on the geometry and configuration, and on the detector. Between D11 and D22, when both instruments are working with a gas-filled detector, the difference of
g ( λ ) values was of the order of few percents. As long as possible, it is thus extremely important to carry out the calibrations in the same setting conditions as the samples.
\(\left( {{{{\rm d}{\rm \Sigma} } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{{\rm d}{\rm \Sigma} } {{\rm d}{\rm \Omega} }}} \right.} {{\rm d}{\rm \Omega} }}} \right)_{{\rm H}_{\rm 2} {\rm O}}^{{\rm real}}\)
can be calculated using ( 9 ). It is also possible to recalculate
\(\left( {{{{\rm d} {\rm \Sigma} } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{d {\rm \Sigma} } {d {\rm \Omega} }}} \right. } {{\rm d} {\rm \Omega} }}} \right)_{{\rm H_2 O}}^{{\rm real}} {\rm{ }}\)
by measuring standards (polymer) from samples with a known cross section [ 17 ,
18 ].
\(\left( {{{{\rm d}{\rm \Sigma} } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{{\rm d}{\rm \Sigma} } {{\rm d}{\rm \Omega} }}} \right.} {{\rm d}{\rm \Omega} }}} \right)_{{\rm H}_{\rm 2}{\rm O} }^{{\rm real}}\)
as a function of
λ
may be empirically extrapolated with a polynomial function: $$\left( {{{{\rm d}{\rm \Sigma} } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{{\rm d}{\rm \Sigma} } {{\rm d}{\rm \Omega} }}} \right.} {{\rm d}{\rm \Omega} }}} \right)_{{\rm H}_{\rm 2} {\rm O}}^{{\rm real}} = {\rm A + B}{\rm .}\lambda + {\rm C}{\rm .}\lambda ^{\rm 2} + {\rm D}{\rm .}\lambda ^{\rm 3}$$ The water cross-section increases with the wavelength and varies slightly with temperature. The values are close to 1 cm −1 . Sample normalization using water as standard is obtained according the following equation: $$\left( {{{{\rm d}{\rm \Sigma} } \over {{\rm d}{\rm \Omega} }}} \right)_{{\rm sample}} = {1 \over {F_{{\rm sc}} }}\left( {{{{\rm d}{\rm \Sigma} } \over {{\rm d}{\rm \Omega} }}} \right)_{{\rm H}_{\rm 2} {\rm O}}^{{\rm real}} {{\displaystyle \left[ {{{I_{{\rm sample}} - I_{{\rm B4C}} } \over {Tr_{{\rm sample}} }} - {{I_{{\rm sample - EC}} - I_{{\rm B4C}} } \over {Tr_{{\rm sample - EC}} }}} \right]{1 \over {e_{{\rm sample}} }}} \over {\left[ {{{I_{{\rm H}_{\rm 2} {\rm O}} - I_{{\rm B4C}} } \over {Tr_{{\rm H}_{\rm 2} {\rm O}} }} - {{I_{{\rm H}_{\rm 2} {\rm O - EC}} - I_{{\rm B4C}} } \over {Tr_{{\rm H}_{\rm 2} {\rm O - EC}} }}} \right]{1 \over {e_{{\rm H}_{\rm 2} {\rm O}} }}}}$$
((13))
The subscript EC refers to the empty cell.
Tr
is the transmission with respect to the empty beam,
I
is the number of neutrons per second.
F
sc
is a scaling coefficient equal to 1 when the water and the sample are measured in the same instrument configuration. For large sample-to-detector distance ( D  > 10 m) and thus large collimation, the flux and water count rates are too low to get a good statistics in a reasonable time. A water run measured in a configuration with higher flux (at shorter sample to detector distance) but the same
λ
is used to correct the variations of detector efficiency. Then, the scaling factor
F
sc
corrects the flux that varies with the collimation and the solid angle according to $$F = {{\left( {\Phi _0 {\rm \Delta} {\rm \Omega} } \right)_{{\rm sample}} } \over {\left( {\Phi _0 {\rm \Delta} {\rm \Omega} } \right)_{{\rm H}_{\rm 2} {\rm O}} }} = \left( {{{{\rm Coll}_{{\rm H}_{\rm 2} {\rm O}} D_{{\rm H}_{\rm 2} {\rm O}} } \over {{\rm Coll}_{{\rm sample}} D_{{\rm sample}} }}} \right)^2 = {{\Phi _{{\rm sample}} } \over {\Phi _{{\rm H}_{\rm 2} {\rm O}} }}\left( {{{D_{{\rm H}_{\rm 2} {\rm O}} } \over {D_{{\rm sample}} }}} \right)^2 ,$$

is to apply ( 2 ), the delicate point being the accurate measurement of

O is the origin of the scattered beams (sample position) and O′ the image of the direct beam on the detector.

ADA ′. The sample-to-detector distance is represented by the segment
\(D\left( {2\theta } \right) = \overline {OO\,'} \,'\)
and
\(p = \overline {A'B\,'}\)
is the pixel size.
\(D\left( 0 \right) = \overline {OO'}\)
The sample-to-detector distance and the solid angle are function of
2θ
according to $${\rm \Delta} {\rm \Omega} \left( {2\theta } \right) = {{\overline {AB} ^2 } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{\overline {AB} ^2 } {\left[ {D\left( {2\theta } \right)} \right]}}} \right. } {\left[ {D\left( {2\theta } \right)} \right]}}^2 ,$$
$$D\left( {2\theta } \right) = {{D\left( {2\theta = 0} \right)} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{D\left( {2\theta = 0} \right)} {\cos \left( {2\theta } \right)}}} \right. } {\cos \left( {2\theta } \right)}}\ {\rm{ and }}\ \overline {AB} = p^2 \cos \left( {2\theta } \right).$$ Finally $${\rm \Delta} {\rm \Omega} \left( {2\theta } \right) = {{p^2 \cos ^3 \left( {2\theta } \right)} \over {D\left( {2\theta = 0} \right)}}.$$

Equation ( 15 ) shows that the solid angle value decreases with
q . An example is shown in

D  = 1.4 m,
C  = 17.6 m, and
λ
= 6 Å. The data are normalized in absolute scale according to ( 8 ). The hollow diamonds are obtained taking the solid angle as a constant. One observes a strong decrease of the intensity as
q
increases. The full symbols are calculated using ( 15 ) which allows one to get the flat scattering expected for incoherent scatterers. The slight decrease still remaining at high

can be due to inelastic effects in light water. Figure 13‐6 Water scattering measured on D22 at short sample-to-detector distance,

4.4 Transmission 4.4.1 Definition The transmission is the ratio of the intensities at
q  = 0 between the beam through the sample and the white beam. It depends on the sum of coherent, incoherent, and absorption cross-sections and also from the scattering angle. $${\rm Tr}\left( {2\theta ,\lambda } \right) = {{I\left( {2\theta } \right)} \over {I_0 }} = \exp \left( { - \mu \left( \lambda \right)e\left( {2\theta } \right)} \right),$$
$${\rm Tr}(\lambda)={I(0)\over I_0}=\exp\left( { - N{\rm \sigma} \left( \lambda \right)e\left( {2\theta } \right)} \right) = \exp \left( { - \mu \left( \lambda \right)e\left( {2\theta } \right)} \right) = \exp \left( { - {{e\left( {2\theta } \right)} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{e\left( {2\theta } \right)} {\rm \Lambda} }} \right. } {\rm \Lambda} }\left( \lambda \right)} \right),$$
((16))
Where
\(\mu \left( \lambda \right)\) , the mass adsorption coefficient is wavelength-dependant and
\({\rm \Lambda} \left( \lambda \right)\)
is the mean free path of the radiation in the sample.
\({\rm \sigma} \left( \lambda \right)\)
can be calculated from the transmission measured at
θ  = 0 and is the sum of three terms:
$${\rm \sigma} \left( \lambda \right) = \sum\limits_i {{\rm \sigma} _{\rm coh,i} } + {\rm \sigma} _{\rm incoh,i} + {\rm \sigma} _{\rm abs,i} \left( \lambda \right)$$
((17))
\({\rm \sigma} _{\rm abs} \left( \lambda \right)\)
the absorption cross-section is due to nuclear capture process. It is inversely proportional to the amplitude of the wave vector
\(k = {{2\pi } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{2\pi } \lambda }} \right. } \lambda }\)
and thus proportional to
λ . The values for a neutron velocity of 2200 m/s (1.8 Å) are given in
Table
13-1
. Then, for a wavelength
λ ,
\({\rm \sigma} _{\rm abs} \left( \lambda \right) = {\rm \sigma} _{\rm abs} \left( \lambda \right){\lambda \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {\lambda {1.8}}} \right. } {1.8}}\) . Table 13‐1 Length scattering densities, coherent, incoherent and absorption cross-sections for selected atoms and their isotopes [ 20 ] Full size table
The absorption cross sections of selected nuclei and isotopes are listed in
Table
13-1
. Typical values range from 0.1 to 10 barns (10 −24
cm 2 ) but can be very high for certain atoms like Boron and its isotope B(768 and 3,835 barns), Cadmium (2,520 barns), or Gadolinium (49,700 barns). Consequently, these very absorbent materials are widely used as shielding (beam-stop, coverage inside walls of the detector tube, etc.).
\({\rm \sigma} _{\rm coh}\)
and
\({\rm \sigma} _{\rm incoh}\)
are the apparent absorptions due to coherent and incoherent scattering. 4.4.2 Numerical Applications and Examples In the soft condensed matter field, where hydrogen atoms are largely present, the amount of hydrogen or deuterium has a large impact on the transmission. The measured transmissions of 1 mm of H 2 O and D 2 O at 6 Å are 0.52 and 0.93, respectively. The absorption of air is of 1% per meter. For long instruments as SANS spectrometers, it is then important to keep the neutron guides and the detector tank under vacuum. In some cases,
4 He is used to fill the neutron guides. A guide of 1 m length filled with
4 He at atmospheric pressure is considered. Helium density is d = 0.2 g/cm 3 . The molecule number per cm 3
is
\(d_N = {{{\rm d}N_a } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{dN_a } M}} \right. } M}\) , with
N
a
the Avogadro number and
M
the molar mass. For a length of 1 m, the transmission is
\({\rm Tr} = \exp \left( { - d_N {\rm \sigma} _T L} \right)\) , with
d
N
= 0.301 × 10 20
mol/cm 3 ,
σ
T
= 1.34 × 10 −24
cm 2 , and
L  = 100 cm, then
Tr  = 0.996. The absorption is nearly negligible, much weaker than air. Now with
3 He in the same conditions,
\({\rm \sigma} _T \approx {\rm \sigma} _a = 5333 \ \times 10^{ - 24} {\lambda \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {\lambda {1.8}}} \right. } {1.8}}{\rm{ }}{\rm cm^2}\)
and
Tr  ≈ 10 −7 . 4.4.3 Transmission at Large Angles Does the transmission depend on the scattering angle? As for the solid angle calculation, the question can be raised for scattering measured at small detector distances and thus high scattering angles. The path length of the beam is different from the sample thickness
e
at large angles ( Figure
13‐7
). A beam scattered at a position
x
from the entrance window traverses a length
l
calculated in ( 18 ). $$l\left( {2\theta } \right) = {{x + \left( {e - x} \right)} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{x + \left( {e - x} \right)} {\left( {\cos \left( {2\theta } \right)} \right)}}} \right. } {\left( {\cos \left( {2\theta } \right)} \right)}}$$
((18))
We introduce the function:
\(f\left( {2\theta } \right) = - 1 + {1 \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {1 {\cos \left( {2\theta } \right)}}} \right. } {\cos \left( {2\theta } \right)}}\) . Equation ( 18 ) becomes: $$l\left( {2\theta } \right) = e + x\left[ \ {f\left( {2\theta } \right)} \right]$$
((19))
Before interaction the beam is attenuated by a factor
\(\exp \left( { - \mu x} \right)\)
and after interaction by a coefficient
\(\exp \left( { - \mu {{\left( {e - x} \right)} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{\left( {e - x} \right)} {\cos \left( {2\theta } \right)}}} \right. } {\cos \left( {2\theta } \right)}}} \right)\) . Hence, the transmission is: $$\eqalign{ Tr\left( {2\theta } \right) = & {1 \over e} \int\limits_0^e {\exp \left[ { - \mu \left( {e + xf\left({2\theta } \right)} \right)} \right]} {\rm d}x = {1 \over e}\exp \left( { - \mu e} \right) \int\limits_0^e {\exp \left[ { - \mu xf\left( {2\theta } \right)} \right]} {\rm d}x \cr & {Tr\left( {2\theta } \right) = \left[ {\mu ef\left( {2\theta } \right)} \right]^{ - 1} \exp \left( { - \mu e} \right)\left\{ {1 - \exp \left[ { - \mu ef\left( {2\theta } \right)} \right]} \right\}}}$$

the diminution of the transmission is of only 3% for D 2 O and can be neglected. The decrease is of 23% for H 2 O and a connection must be taken into account during data reduction. Figure 13‐7 Path length of a scattered beam Full size image

4.5 Multiple Scattering Multiple scattering occurs when a scattered neutron is scattered again in the sample. There is always a probability that such event occurs but it must not dominate the total scattering. Multiple scattering smears the true intensity since the total intensity is the sum of intensities due to single, twice, or more scattering vectors at unknown angles. The data interpretation becomes nearly impossible or wrong, if the multiple scattering is not detected. Suspicion of multiple scattering can be done in case of low transmission (<0.5) and strong scattering intensity at low
q
(>10 4
cm −1 ). There is no general method to correct data from multiple scattering but in case of “weak” multiple scattering, different methods are proposed [ 21 ]. A criterion to avoid multiple scattering has been given in [ 22 ] and says that “part of attenuation of the direct beam due to coherent scattering should not be <9.” This result has been established with studies on interpenetrating polymer networks. 4.5.1 Transmission at Large Angles In case of low multiple scattering, the effect is not easily detected. Different scattering distortions are observed. First evidence is that several curves measured at different configurations do not overlap. In case of fractal dimension, at low
q , the multiple scattering induces a lowering of the intensity that could be confused with a plateau. Artifacts due to multiple scattering are presented in

With concentrated microemulsions, it has been observed on the contrary, an increase in the low
q
scattering and of the width of the correlation peak, with a multiple image of the main scattering peak and an increase of the incoherent background [ 24 ]. 4.5.2 How to Prevent Multiple Scattering?
Use thinner sample, use diluted sample (if dilution does not induce phase transition)
Use shorter wavelength to increase the mean free path Λ(λ)
Decrease the contrast Δ ρ
(for example, use deuterated compound in deuterated matrix)
4.6 Subtraction of Incoherent Background The incoherent scattering, mainly coming from the hydrogen molecules, gives raise to a flat background that is necessary to subtract before the data analysis. The subtraction is a delicate point, since an under or upper estimation of the incoherent background may vary a slope or the position of a minimum in
q
and thus alter the data interpretation. Different methods are then employed.
The incoherent background can be estimated with the measurement at the highest possible scattering vector
q
(>0.4 Å −1 ) because in most of the cases in soft condensed matter the objects are big and the coherent scattering becomes negligible.
In case of very dilute deuterated compound in hydrogenated solvent, the subtraction of the scattering from the solvent will be sufficient.
A reference sample with no structure and containing the same amount of H and D molecules (for example, a mixture of H 2 O/D 2 O) can be measured. This requires to know exactly the sample composition or to prepare a mixture having the same transmission as the sample.
If the scattering cross section as a
q
dependence, one can write:
\({{\rm d {\rm \Sigma} } \over {\rm d {\rm \Omega} }} \propto Aq^{ - d} + B,\)
where
B
represents the background. At high
q , one can suppose that the Porod regime is reached, then
\({{\rm d {\rm \Sigma} } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{d {\rm \Sigma} } {d {\rm \Omega} q^4 \propto A + B}}} \right. } {\rm d {\rm \Omega}} q^4 \propto A + B}q^4\) . The slope gives the value of the incoherent background. This simple empirical method gives reasonable results.
The incoherent background can be calculated in principle with the tabulated values of
b
inc . Nevertheless, the values are given for bound atoms, and are smaller than the real ones. Moreover, the incoherent contribution coming from the spin is not taken into account.
4.7 Conclusion The data reduction is a crucial step before data analysis. Particular care must be taken in the high-angle scattering due to corrections for the solid angle, transmission and the incoherent scattering, as described in a recent article [ 24 ]. The importance of the absolute calibration is obvious. SANS curves obtained on different spectrometers or in different
q -ranges can be joined together and compared. Absolute intensity allows one to calculate molecular mass, volume fraction, specific area of scattering elements, etc. It also can prove the presence of multiple scattering, repulsive or attractive forces, unexpected aggregation, or sample degradation. In addition length scattering densities can be extracted and hydration numbers deduced. The experimental intensity in absolute scale cm −1
as a function of the scattering vector
q
is now established. The standard models to be compared with the experiment will be described in the following section. 5 Modeling of the Scattered Intensity A detailed theory of small-angle scattering can be found in [ 2 ,
25 ]. In this section, only the basis equations will be introduced and stress will be put on analytic expressions widely used and illustrated by recent experiments. The interaction with the neutron beam depends on the kind of atom
i . The scattering probability is proportional to a surface
\({\rm \sigma} _s^i\) , characteristic from the interaction between the radiation and the atom. This surface is the scattering cross section and corresponds to the atom surface seen by the radiation. The cross section is equal to
\({\rm \sigma} _s^i = 4\pi \left\langle {\left| {b^i } \right|^2 } \right\rangle\) .
b
i
is the scattering length which characterizes the range of interaction. The scattering length density (SLD) is then equal to
\(\rho \left( r \right) = \sum\limits_i {\rho _i \left( r \right)} b^i ,\)
where
\(\rho _i \left( r \right)\)
is the local density of atom
i . Basic relationships between the neutron scattering lengths and cross sections, dependencies on the spin and values are tabulated in [ 20 ]. Some of them are given in
Table
13-1
. The differential cross-section is related to the amplitude of the scattered wave by $${{\rm d {\rm \sigma} } \over {\rm d {\rm \Omega} }} = \left| b \right|^2 .$$
5.1 Rules of Thumb in Small-Angle Scattering We consider a statically isotropic system where the particle positions are not correlated at long range. In the Born approximation, the interaction with a scatterer does not depend on the scattering by the other scatterers. In this case, the amplitude scattered by the different particles can be added. For a particle of length scattering density
ρ ( r ), the amplitude is given by: $$A\left( q \right) = \int\limits_{\!\!V}\! {\rho \left( r \right)e^{ - iqr} {\rm{d}}r}$$
((21))
\(\rho \left( r \right)\)
describes the distribution of length densities in the particle and is directly related to the chemical composition. It is convenient to split
\(\rho \left( r \right)\)
into two parts and to put in evidence the fluctuations around an average value: $$\rho \left( r \right) = \left\langle \rho \right\rangle + \delta \rho \left( r \right).$$
((22))
The contribution from the average term is null for
q  > 0, then
$$A\left( q \right) = \int\limits_{\!\!V} \!{\delta \rho \left( r \right)e^{ - iqr} {\rm{d}}r} .$$
((23))
The detector measures the intensity which is the absolute square of the amplitude. The scattered intensity per unit volume is: $$I\left( q \right) = {{A\left( q \right)A^* \left( q \right)} \over V} = {1 \over V}\int\!\!\!\int\limits_{\!\!\!VV} \!\!{\delta \rho \left( r \right)\delta \rho \left( {r'} \right)e^{ - iq(r - r')} } {\rm{d}}r{\rm{d}}r'.$$
((24))
In the simplest case where the system is made of two phases, one of length scattering density
ρ
p
and the second one of length scattering density
ρ
s
, ( 24 ) becomes:
$$I\left( q \right) = {1 \over V}\left( {\rho _{\rm{p}} - \rho _{\rm{S}} } \right)^2 \int\limits_{V_{\rm{p}} } \!\!{\int\limits_{V_{\rm{p}} } \!{e^{ - iq\left( {r - r'} \right)} {\rm{d}}r} {\rm{d}}r' = } \ {1 \over V}{\rm \Delta} \rho ^2 \int\limits_{V_{\rm{p}} } \!\!{\int\limits_{V_{\rm{p}} }\! \!{e^{ - iq\left( {r - r'} \right)} {\rm{d}}r} {\rm{d}}r'}$$
((25))
Δ ρ
is the difference of length scattering densities between particle and matrix. An assembly of
N
p
identical particles is next considered. Equation ( 25 ) can be rewritten as: $$I\left( q \right) = {{V_{\rm{p}}^2 } \over V}N_{\rm{p}} {\rm \Delta} \rho ^2 \left[ {F\left( q \right)} \right]^2 {\rm{,}}\quad {\rm{ with }}\ F\left( q \right) = {1 \over {V_{\rm{p}} }}\int\limits_{V_{\rm{p}} }\!\! {e^{ - iqr} {\rm{d}}r} ,$$
((26))
Finally, with the usual notations, one gets: $$I\left( q \right) = \Phi V_p {\rm \Delta} \rho ^2 P\left( q \right)$$
((27))
P ( q ) is called the particle form factor and describes the geometry of the scattering object.
P ( q ) tends to 1 for
q =  0. We consider now an assembly of
N
p
identical particles correlated in space. The measured intensity is equal to the statistical average over all the particle positions and orientations in a volume
V : $$I\left( q \right) = {{A\left( q \right)A^* \left( q \right)} \over V} = {1 \over V}\left\langle {\int\limits_{\!\!V} \!{\rho \left( r \right)e^{ - iqr} {\rm{d}}r} \int\limits_{\!\!V} \!{\rho \left( {r'} \right)e^{ - iqr'} } {\rm{d}}r'} \right\rangle$$
((28))
Let us write
r
as
r  =  r
i
+  u , $$I\left( q \right) = {1 \over V}\left\langle {\sum\limits_i {e^{ - iqr_i } } \int\limits_{V_{\rm{p}} } \!\!{\rho \left( u \right)e^{ - iqu} {\rm{d}}u} \sum\limits_j {e^{ - iqr_j } } \int\limits_{V_{\rm{p}} } \!\!{\rho \left( v \right)e^{ - iqv} {\rm d}v} } \right\rangle$$
((29))
For spherical particles with identical interactions, the average of the product is equal to the product of the averages, then: $$I\left( q \right) = {N \over V}\left\langle {\left[ {{1 \over N}\sum\limits_{i = 1}^N {\sum\limits_{j = 1}^N {e^{ - iq\left( {r_i - r_j } \right)} } } } \right]{\rm{ }}\left[ {\int\limits_{V_{\rm{p}} } \!\!{\int\limits_{V_{\rm{p}} } \!\!{\rho \left( u \right)\rho \left( v \right)e^{ - iq(u - v)} {\rm{d}}u}{\rm d}v } \ } \right]} \right\rangle .$$
((30))
One recognizes in the second term the particle form factor. The first term is the structure factor
S ( q ) describing the correlation between particle mass centers. If one excludes the case
r
i
=  r
j
then the expression for the structure factor becomes: $$S\left( q \right) = 1 + {1 \over N}\left\langle {\sum\limits_{i = 1}^N {\sum\limits_{j \ne i}^{} {e^{ - iq\left( {r_i - r_j } \right)} } } } \right\rangle .$$
((31))
In a continuous medium, ( 31 ) can be written as: $$S\left( q \right) = 1 + {{N - 1} \over V}\int\limits_{\!\!V}\! {g\left( r \right)e^{ - iqr} } {\rm{d}}r,$$
((32))
where
g ( r ) is the correlation function between particle mass centers. At
q  = 0, according to ( 31 )
S ( q )  = N . We define the following function
\(S_m \left( q \right)\)
as $$S_{\rm{m}} \left( q \right) = S\left( q \right) - {{N - 1} \over V}\delta \left( q \right).$$
((33))
With
δ
the Dirac function. Then, $$S_{\rm{m}} \left( q \right) = 1 + {{N - 1} \over V}\int\limits_{\!\!V} {\left[ {g\left( r \right) - 1} \right]e^{ - iqr} } {\rm{d}}r.$$
((34))
In the case of isotropic interactions, azimuthal (radial) averaging reduces ( 34 ) to: $$S_{\rm{m}} \left( q \right) = 1 + {{N - 1} \over V}\int\limits_{\!\!V} \!{4\pi r^2 \left[ {g\left( r \right) - 1} \right]{{\sin qr} \over {qr}}} {\rm{d}}r.$$
((35))
To summarize, the intensity per unit volume
V
of
N
p
homogeneous isotropic scatterers of volume
V
p
and coherent length scattering density
ρ
p
dispersed in a medium of length scattering density
ρ
is the product of the form factor and the structure factor weighted by a contrast factor
K
c
follows: $$I\left( q \right) = \Phi V_{\rm{p}} {\rm \Delta} \rho ^2 P\left( q \right)S\left( q \right) = K_{\rm{c}} P\left( q \right)S\left( q \right).$$
((36))
In the following, the three relevant parts of the above equation,
ρ ,
P ( q ), and
S ( q ) will be detailed and numerical applications will be described to aid in the understanding and interpretation of scattering curves. 5.2 SLD, Contrast Variation, and Isotopic Labeling The SLD from a molecule with
x
i
, atoms
i
and molecular volume
v
p
is: $$\rho _p = {{\sum\limits_i {x_i b_i } } \over {v_{\rm{p}} }}$$
((37))
b
i
is the coherent neutron scattering length of atom
i . Only coherent scattered neutrons carry information about structure. The molecular volume
v
p
requires knowledge of the bulk density of the molecule. It can be difficult to measure and is a source of inaccuracy on the SLD value.
ρ
is usually expressed in cm −2
or Å −2 . The calculation of the atomic
b
i
is not trivial and values are experimentally determined and tabulated [ 20 ]. The magnitude is determined by the quantum mechanics of the neutron–nucleus interaction. It varies in an unsystematic way with the atomic number, depending on the direction of the nuclear spin and drastic variations can be found between two isotopes, the main example being the difference of value and sign between hydrogen and deuterium atoms. A negative value signifies a shift of π of the phase on scattering. This last property is of great importance and opens the possibility of what is called “contrast variation.” The principle is to substitute one atom by one of its isotopes to induce a strong variation in the scattering length, assuming that no drastic perturbation of the properties (physical, chemical, etc.) of the sample occurs. In soft condensed matter, the compounds of interest (colloids, emulsions, surfactants, polymers, etc.) contain a large quantity of hydrogen molecules which can be substituted in principle by deuterium atoms and
b
H  = −0.374 10 −12
cm −2
and
b
D  = 6.37 10 −12
cm −2 . This feature is at the origin of many SANS experiments and important advancements have been done in the description of molecular assemblies. One of the pioneering studies using the contrast variation method has been carried out by Stuhrmann in 1974 at the ILL [ 3 – 5 ] to investigate the structure of biological macromolecule like ferritin. In the first article the author concludes that “the most promising domain of neutron small-angle scattering seems to be the study of H-D exchange of reactions of macromolecules in dilute solutions . ” Thirty years later, this conclusion is still relevant. Isotopic substitution can be used to create a contrast inside a particle by a specific labeling of a part of the molecule. In the field of polymer science, the technique is widely used. For example, the difference in length scattering density between hydrogenated and deuterated polystyrene ( ρ
PSH  = 1.42 × 10 10
cm −2
and
ρ
PSD  = 6.42 × 10 10
cm −2 ) was used to follow the chain conformation during extrusion of a polymer melt made of a few percent (ca. 5%) of hydrogenated polystyrene mixed with deuterated polystyrene [ 15 ]. 5.2.1 The Zero Average Contrast Method For semidiluted polymer or polyelectrolyte solutions, both intra- and intercorrelations between the polymer chains contribute to the scattered intensity. The zero average contrast (ZAC) method allows the elimination of the signal coming from the structure factor (the intercorrelations) to see only the form factor from a single chain. The method consists in the exchange of hydrogen by deuterium atoms in the polymer chain and the modification of the length scattering density of solvent by a mixture of hydrogenated and deuterated molecules. We consider a polymer solution containing
N
h
and
N
d , H- and D-polymer chains, with
N
h
and
N
d
monomers, respectively. The volume fraction of deuterated monomers is called
Φ . The ZAC is obtained when the following condition is fulfilled: $$\left( {1 - \Phi } \right){\rm \Delta} \rho _{\rm{H}} + \Phi {\rm \Delta} \rho _{\rm{D}} = 0,$$
((38))
where Δ ρ
H
and Δ ρ
D
are the differences of length scattering densities from the H- and D- monomers and the solvent, respectively. Different examples of ZAC applications are illustrated by the references given in [ 27 ]. The experiments have demonstrated the vermicular form factors of fully charged PSSNa polymer chains. Reference [ 28 ] presents a study of polystyrene in diethylphalate in good solvant where the form factor of a single chain as a function of the shear rate is investigated. 5.2.2 Contrast Variation Technique One of the main applications is found in multiple component systems to match a compound or a part of aggregate with a specific isotopic mixture of solvent. This technique called “contrast match” has been successfully used to elucidate the structure of particles composed of different layers, as for example, in microemulsions; to investigate surfactant layers adsorbed around mineral particles [ 29 ]; and for characterization of complex systems [ 30 ]. We recall that the scattered intensity for a dilute system without interaction is: $$I\left( q \right) = \Phi V_{\rm{p}} \left( {{\rm \Delta} \rho } \right)^2 P\left( q \right).$$
((39))
At
q = 0 ,
P ( q ) tends to 1 and $$I\left( 0 \right) = \Phi V_{\rm{p}} \left( {{\rm \Delta} \rho } \right)^2 = \Phi V_{\rm{p}} \left( {\rho _{\rm{p}} - \rho _{\rm{s}} } \right)^2 .$$
((40))
ρ
p
is the average scattering density of the solute and
ρ
s
that of solvent or matrix. The knowledge of the molecular volume is sometimes a delicate point, and the calculation of
ρ
p
is extremely sensitive to
V
p , the volume in bulk and thus to the density
d
since
\(V_{\rm{p}} = {M \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {M d}} \right. } d}\) ,
M
being the molar mass. In such cases
d  can be accurately determined by measuring the length scattering density of the molecule. The average length scattering density of a H/D mixture is: $$\overline \rho _{\rm{s}} = x\rho _{\rm{s}}^{\rm{D}} + \left( {1 - x} \right)\rho _{\rm{s}}^{\rm{H}}$$
((41))
with
x
the volume fraction of deuterated solvent.
\(\sqrt {I\left( {q \to 0} \right)} \propto \pm \left( {{\rm \Delta} \rho } \right)\)
is linear as a function of
x
if the particles are monodisperse. At contrast match
I (0) = 0 one can deduce
x
and
ρ
p . For polydisperse particles in solution, the intensity is never zero, and only a minimum is obtained. Experimentally, a contrast variation experiment consists in measuring the scattered intensity at the lowest possible q. The samples prepared at the same concentration in different mixtures of D/H solvent, from fully deuterated to fully hydrogenated solvent. The following example presents an experimental determination of the SLD of laponite particles from a contrast variation experiment ( Figure
13‐10
). Laponite is a synthetic clay which the particles have been characterized by other techniques as well (cryofracture and TEM [ 32 ]; AFM [ 31 ]). The particles can be described as monodisperse disks of 1 nm thickness and 30 nm diameter. The general composition is Si 8 Mg 5.45 Li 0.4 H 4 O 24 Na 0.7 , density 2.65, and the volume of the unit cell is 4.7847 10 −22
cm 3 . One gets
ρ
laponite  = 3.94.10 10
cm −2 . Figure 13‐10 Contrast variation experiment from an aqueous solution of Laponite,
Φ  = 0.75%. The square root of the absolute intensity at low of plotted versus the volume fraction of D 2 O [ 31 ]. Full size image
The contrast match point is found at volume fraction of D 2 O of 0.673, corresponding to
ρ  = 4.11 10 10
cm −2 , in good agreement with the previously calculated value. 5.2.3 Contrast and Background The contrast is strongly increased when one of the compounds (solvent or solute) is deuterated. Then one has to select a sample composition with fewer hydrogen molecules to reduce the incoherent background. In general, one chooses deuterated solvents because many of them can be purchased even if they remain expensive. On the other hand, deuterated molecules are less commonly used and require a good knowledge of chemistry to synthesize. Secondly, in dilute or semidilute solution, the main source of hydrogen comes from the solvent. 5.2.4 Limits of Isotopic Labeling In general, one assumes that there is no drastic change of the properties of the samples after isotopic substitution. Nevertheless, it is known that physical and chemical properties may slightly vary. The θ-temperature, the melting temperature, the temperature of phase transitions may change from few degrees. The CMC (critical micellar concentration) is decreased by replacing D 2 O by H 2 O. For example, the CMC of the nonionic surfactant C 12 E 4
varies from 4.91 10 −5
mol/L in H 2 O to 5.65 10 −5
mol/L in D 2 O at 25°C [ 33 ]. Phase separation has been observed in binary mixtures of deuterated and hydrogenated polymer as mentioned in [ 34 ] with polybutadiene and can lead to incorrect interpretations of sample behavior if extrapolated to fully protonated samples. A significant
q -dependence has been measured in hydrogenated and deuterated mixtures of alkanes ( n -decane and isooctane) whereas the scattering of pure hydrogenated and deuterated solvent gives flat isotropic scattering. Alkane molecules are relatively large and there is no exchange of H and D as in light and heavy water mixtures. Consequently, there is a coherent term resulting from the sum of scattering due to density and composition fluctuations [ 35 ]. Labile hydrogens from alcohol, acid or base functions can be exchanged between solute and solvent. They have to be taken into account in contrast match experiments. Examples of length scattering variations for various amino acids in D 2 O/H 2 O mixtures are plotted in [ 36 ]. 5.3 Analytical Expressions of Particle Form Factors Two possible approaches may be applied to determine the particle form factor. The direct method consists in calculating analytical expressions which are compared to the experimental data by varying parameters (radius, length, polydispersity, etc) in order to minimize the
χ
2 : $$\chi ^2 = \sum\limits_{N - x} {\left[ {{{\left( {I_{{\rm{model}}} \left( q \right) - I_{\exp } \left( q \right)} \right)} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{\left( {I_{{\rm{model}}} \left( q \right) - I_{\exp } \left( q \right)} \right)} {E(q)}}} \right. } {E(q)}}} \right]^2 /\left( {N - x} \right)} .$$
((42))
E ( q ) is the error on experimental intensity;
x
is the number of variables. In most of the cases, when no interaction peak is present, the intensity falls quickly with
q . Equation ( 36 ) assigns a larger weight to the accurate agreement between experiment and model at low
q
values. Taking the logarithm of the intensity will enhance the weight of points at high
q
and improve the fitting at large angles. The indirect methods treat the inverse Fourier transform of the data. A detailed review of particle form factors can be found in [ 37 ]. In the following, only the most used equations are recalled and illustrated by typical selected examples, the following list is of course not exhaustive. 5.3.1 Sphere The form factor of homogeneous sphere of radius
R
is known since 1951 [ 38 ]: $$F_{\rm{S}} \left( {q,R} \right) = \left[ {3{{\sin \left( {qR} \right) - \left( {qR} \right)\cos \left( {qR} \right)} \over {\left( {qR} \right)^3 }}} \right]{\rm{ and }}\ P_{\rm{S}} \left( {q,R} \right) = \left[ {F_{\rm{S}} \left( {q,R} \right)} \right]^2 .$$
((43))
The
P ( q ) of the sphere is equal to zero for
qR  = 4.493, 7.725, etc. This form factor can be applied to describe surfactant micelles in solution, colloidal particles (latex, ferrofluid, silica beads), or globular protein in biology. 5.3.2 Concentric Shells and Hollow Sphere The case of sphere can be extended to spherical concentric shells.
N
shells are considered, with radii
R
i
and scattering densities
ρ
i
,
R
1
being the outer radius, then: $$P\left( q \right) = F^2 \left( q \right) = \left[ {\sum\limits_{i = 1}^N {V_i \left( {\rho _{i - 1} - \rho _i } \right)F_{\rm{S}} \left( {q,R_i } \right)} } \right]^2 ,\quad \rho _0 = \rho _{\rm{s}} {\rm{, the \ solvent \ SLD}}{\rm{.}}$$
((44))
In the case of two concentric shells of radii
R
1
and
R
2
, R
1
> R
2 , the previous equation is reduced to: $$P\left( q \right) = F^2 \left( q \right) = \left[ {{{\left( {\rho _1 - \rho _{\rm{S}} } \right)V_1 F_{\rm{S}} \left( {q,R_1 } \right) + \left( {\rho _2 - \rho _1 } \right)V_2 F_{\rm{S}} \left( {q,R_2 } \right)} \over {\left( {\rho _1 - \rho _{\rm{S}} } \right)V_1 + \left( {\rho _2 - \rho _1 } \right)V_2 }}} \right]^2 .$$
((45))
The core-shell model describes accurately colloidal particles composed of a core and a shell. An example combining SAXS and SANS can be found in [ 39 ], where PNIPA chains are grafted on a solid poly(styrene) core. Even if a single spherical model gives reasonable fittings in many systems like micelles in solution, the data fitting is considerably improved by the use of a two-shell model. Indeed, due to hydration of the polar heads, the length scattering densities of the core and of the hydrophilic parts are significantly different. A recent article deals with the modeling of core-shell spherical micelles made of the ionic surfactant (or small polymer) C 18 E 100 , which possesses a huge head group in comparison with the hydrophobic core [ 40 ]. A detailed model for the scattering intensity is developed there. Instead of a two-shell model, the authors add to the classical form factor from a sphere a smoothly decaying scattering density at the surface, a more realistic model, to represent roughness between core and shell and water penetration in the first Angstroms of the hydrophilic part. Taking
ρ
2
= ρ
s , the last equation represents a hollow sphere with an envelop thickness of
R
1
−R
2 . $$P\left( q \right) = F^2 \left( q \right) = \left[ {{{\left( {\rho _1 - \rho _S } \right)} \over {V_1 - V_2 }}\left( {V_1 F_{\rm{S}} \left( {q,R_1 } \right) - V_2 F_{\rm{S}} \left( {q,R_2 } \right)} \right)} \right]^2 .$$
((46))
This model can describe, for example, the scattering of vesicles (liposomes). Many examples are found in literature due to the increased interest of such assemblies which may mimic biomembranes. Another example of an application of this equation is found for microemulsion. In oil in water emulsions, oil droplets are dispersed in a continuous medium of water, the interface between the two media is composed of a monolayer of surfactant molecules. The SLD profile exhibits three steps. By contrast variation experiments, it is then possible to match the surfactant layer or on the contrary to only see it. An illustration can be seen in [ 41 ] with the ternary system AOT/Water/Decane. 5.3.3 Cylinder The expression for a cylinder with radius
R
and length
2L
was calculated in 1951 by Fournet [ 42 ] $$P(q) = \int\limits_0^{\Pi/2} {{{{\rm \sin ^2}(qL\cos \alpha )} \over {(qL\cos \alpha )^2 }}} {{{\rm 4} J_1^2 (qr \ {\rm \sin} \alpha )} \over {(qr{\,\sin} \alpha )^2 }}{\rm \sin} \alpha {\rm d}\alpha .$$
((47))
α
is the angle between the normal to the particle and the scattering vector
q .
J
1
is the first order Bessel function. Below
q = π/R , the
P ( q ) reaches a plateau. For highly asymmetrical particles, with
e/R << 1, and
q  >  π/R , the scattering intensity decreases as
q
−2 . The minima of the function are found for
qR  = 3.83, 7.01, etc. Catanionic mixtures of surfactants exhibit rich phase diagrams, where vesicles, elongated and flat micelles, or lamellar phases are formed as a function of the surfactant composition. An example of cylindrical micelles formed by catanionic surfactants in water can be found in [ 43 ]. Flat rigid nanodisks have been reported in [ 44 ], where the SANS curves exhibit a q −2
decrease over more than two decades. Flat rigid particles as clay (laponite) are also well-fitted by equation ( 47 ) [ 32 , Mourchid et al.]. 5.3.4 Ellipsoid Let us consider an ellipsoid of revolution with semi-axis R, R, and εR. The expression calculated by Guinier [ 1 ] is: $$P\left( {q,R,\varepsilon } \right) = \int\limits_0^{{\pi \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {\pi 2}} \right. } 2}} {P_{\rm{S}} \left( {q,r\left( {R,\varepsilon ,\alpha } \right)} \right)\sin \alpha d\alpha } \;{\rm{with}}\;r\left( {R,\varepsilon ,\alpha } \right) = R\sqrt {\sin ^2 \alpha + \varepsilon ^2 \cos ^2 \alpha } .$$
((48))
P
s
is the form factor from a sphere ( 43 ). Oblate or prolate ellipsoidal objects are easily formed by nonionic surfactant micelles [ 45 ]. The mixture of different surfactant or the addition of host molecules can induce a change in shape from sphere to ellipsoid due to modifications of interactions between surfactant head groups [ 46 ]. Another example is the polymerization of styrene in vesicle bilayer which creates oblate particles, clearly visible by SANS experiments [ 47 ]. 5.3.5 The Guinier Approximation When
q
tends to 0, in the range where
qR
< 1, Guinier has shown that
P ( q ) has a general form which depends only on the radius of gyration of the particle
R
g : $$P\left( q \right) = \Phi V_{\rm{p}} \left[ {1 - {{\left( {qR_{_{\rm{g}} } } \right)^2 } \over 3} + \ldots} \right] \approx \Phi V_{\rm{p}} \exp \left( { - {{\left( {qR_{_{\rm{g}} } } \right)^2 } \over 3}} \right).$$
((49))
This powerful approximation allows one to obtain geometric information by looking only at the behavior at small angles. Nevertheless one should keep in mind that it is only valid at
qR
< 1 for systems without interactions. The plot of ln( I ) as a function of
q
2
gives a linear function, where
R
g

is given by the slope. 5.3.6 The Zimm Approximation For macromolecules in solution, an often used approximation, also coming from limited development of
I ( q ), is the Zimm’s approximation: $${c \over {I\left( q \right)}} = {1 \over {I_0 }}\left( {1 + {{\left( {qR_{_{\rm{g}} } } \right)^2 } \over 3}} \right).$$

5.3.7 Fractals One of the most beautiful examples of a fractal in everyday life is the Romanesco cabbage ( Figure
13‐11
). Fractals are defined by a self-similar structure in a given spatial range where the shape observed is independent from the length scale. The mass
M
in a volume
R
d
follows the power law
\(M\left( R \right) \propto R^D\) ,
D
is called the fractal dimension. The density of matter at a distance
R
from any subunit center varies as $$\rho \left( R \right) \propto R^{D - d} .$$
((51))
By Fourier transform one gets
$$I\left( q \right) \propto q^D .$$
((52))
Mass fractals are characterized by exponent between 1 and 3 and surface fractals by exponents between 3 and 4. If mathematically the fractal behavior extends to all length scales, in practice it stops at small scales when the individual scatterers are seen and at large scales when the process of growth stops. In a log–log scale representation, the slope gives directly the fractal dimension and must be observed at least in one order of magnitude to deduce with certitude a fractal process.

5.3.8 Concentrated Surfactant Phases Surfactant molecules are widely used and studied in soft condensed matter. They are at the base of membrane cells and are found nearly everywhere in everyday life, either as natural or synthetic molecules in food, cosmetic, cleaning, ink, etc. If in industry they are used mainly in dilute conditions, these amphiphilic molecules with a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic core form various shapes and organizations in water or oil in more concentrated states. Micelles are generally formed at low concentrations. At higher concentrations, or in presence of salt or by varying the temperature, lamellar, sponge, cubic, or hexagonal phases are formed. All of these phases give typical patterns, where the form factor is modulated by the structure factor. In concentrated and well-ordered systems several Bragg peaks can be measured (see for example,
Figure
13‐13
). From their shape and size, the bending modulus and the rigidity of membranes can be extracted. For interested readers the following articles and lectures are recommended [ 45 ,
46 ]. Figure 13‐12 Comparison of form factors. Figure 12 (a) sphere (grey) smeared with a function of polydispersity (grey), hollow sphere (red); Figure 12 (b) ellipsoid (green), disk (black) and cylinder (red) Full size image

5.3.9 Case of Polymers SANS experiments have greatly contributed to a deeper understanding of the phase behavior and the structure of polymer melts and solutions. Please refer to the articles published in this book from G. Berry (vol I, chap 2), C. Giacomeli and R. Borsali (vol I, chap 3), S. Pederson (vol I, cahp 4), Y. Nakamaru/Norisuye (vol I, chap 5), I. Hamley & V. Castelletto (vol II, chap 8). 5.3.10 Case of Interfaces Consider a two-phase system. At large
q
vectors, the interface is observed at a small scale. Now if the scattering vector is much larger than the characteristic curvature of the interfaces, they appear flat and the intensity is proportional to the total surface area Σ, independently of the shape of the two phases. The so-called Porod limit (1951) says that for a sharp interface (in the normal direction but smooth in any parallel direction) the intensity decreases as
q
−4
at large
q
as $${\rm \Sigma} = {1 \over {2\pi \left( {{\rm \Delta} \rho ^2 } \right)}}\mathop {\bf lim}\limits_{q \to \infty } I\left( q \right) q^4,$$
((53))
where Σ is the specific area, i.e, the surface developed by the interface per unit volume in m 2 /m 3 . Assuming a spherical geometry of the particles, the radius can be deduced as: $$R = {{3{\rm \Phi} } \over {\rm \Sigma} }.$$
((54))
In the case of particles of typical size
R , measuring in the Porod limit means that the
q -range has to be extended up to
q
value around
qR  = 10. A precise determination of the specific area is closely related to the precision of the absolute scaling. The equation allows one to determine the size of very large particles up to the order of micrometers. An example of an application is the measurement of the droplet size in the spontaneous emulsion formed by the well-known beverage “Pastis” [ 50 ]. The emulsion is formed by anethol droplets in a continuous medium of water and ethanol. The radius of droplets is of the order of micrometers and increases with time and temperature. Even on D22, the complete form factor is not accessible by SANS. Only the last part of the form factor, decreasing as
q
−4
is viewed and from this discrepancy it is possible to deduce the radii of the particles. The porod law has been used to analyze data from mesoporous materials (or cement), which develop a large interface with closed pores not accessible with other techniques (as gaseous absorption, for example). Other applications concern pores in alumine [ 51 ], surfactant phases [ 52 ], gels [ 53 ], or emulsions [ 54 ]. Correction of the Porod limit becomes necessary when the modulus of the scattering vector is of the same order as the surface curvature (surface roughness). Different corrections are detailed in [ 55 ]. The different form factors (sphere, hollow sphere, ellipsoid, cylinder, and disk) are illustrated in
Figure
13‐12a
and
b
. The calculation is done for radius or length of 150 Å and layer thickness of 20 Å, in order to compare for identical parameters the variation of the scattering curves induced by the different shapes. The ellipsoidal shape is calculated for
R  = 150 Å and
ε   =  3. For a more realistic representation, the form factors are smeared by a log-normal polydispersity function, as will be explained in the next section. The log–log representation puts clearly into evidence different regimes. At low
q , for
qR
< 1, the scattering curves reach a plateau and are in the so-called “Guinier” regime. Then the first oscillation is related to the larger dimension of the scatterers (outer radius, cylinder length, etc). At intermediary range, the double logarithmic representation appears as a linear slope which is related to the aggregate shape:
q
−1
slope: 1D object like rigid fibers.
q
−2
slope: 2D object or locally planar, as for example, membrane, flat colloidal particle. At high
q , the minimum of the oscillation is related to the lowest dimension of the objects (vesicle bilayer, disk thickness, etc.), followed by a
q
−4
slope, characteristic of the interface between the objects and the solvent. 5.4 Indirect Fourier Transform Method The following method has been developed by O. Glatter. The details of calculation are explained in journal articles [ 56 ] and in a book of lecture notes [ 57 ]. In this approach, there is no hypothesis a priori on the size, shape, and polydispersity of the scattered objects. It consists of an inverse Fourier transformation of the experimental scattering curves which yields the pair distance distribution function
p(r) . The PDDF gives information of the structure in the real space and needs to be compared with calculated models, as spheres, cylinders, etc. It is also possible to construct a model based on an analytical form for the objects with complex shapes and inhomogeneous density. The validity of the model is tested by calculation of the PDDF and
I ( q ) and comparison with the experimental data. Every model that can fit within the errors is acceptable. Additional parameters (obtained with other techniques) will be needed to select the right model. More recently, the generalized indirect Fourier transform (GIFT) aims to determine simultaneously the form factor and the structure factor in case of interacting particles [ 58 ]. The pertinent use of the program package requires training; it is then an extremely powerful tool for SANS data analysis. Ab initio analysis of particle shape and domain structure programs has been developed by D. Svergun as well. The approach based on IFT is explained in detail in [ 59 ]. The powerful algorithms are used in soft condensed matter but also for biological samples, as for example, to refine the configuration of proteins in solutions. 5.5 Structure Factors of Colloids A detailed lecture on interacting colloidal suspensions can be found in [ 60 ].
S ( q ) is related to the pair correlation function
g ( r ), which describes the local order of the scatterers, i.e., the probability of finding a particle at a given distance from another one.
g ( r ) depends on the interaction potential. $$g\left( r \right) = e^{ - {{V\left( r \right)} \over {k_B T}}} ,$$
((55))
where
V(r)
is the mean field potential. In case of relatively dilute systems,
V ( r )  = U ( r ), the interaction pair potential. Assuming that
N
> >1, the structure factor can be written as $$S\left( q \right) = 1 + {N \over V}\int_V {\left( {g\left( r \right) - 1} \right)e^{ - iqr} {\rm{d}}r} .$$
((56))
Or in case of isotropic interactions ( 56 ) becomes $$S\left( q \right) = 1 + 4\pi {N \over V}\int_V {\left( {g\left( r \right) - 1} \right)r^2 {{\sin qr} \over {qr}}{\rm{d}}r} .$$
((57))
Typically, the structure factor is a dimensionless oscillatory function that tends to unity at high
q
and equals 1 for dilute solutions. The first maximum at
q
0
is related to the distance between the nearest neighbors by
\({{2\pi } \mathord{\left/{\vphantom {{2\pi } {q_0 }}} \right.} {q_0 }}\) . The experimental structure factors can be obtained by measuring the absolute intensity at two particle concentrations and by dividing the scattering at the highest concentration by the one at lowest concentration, in dilute condition. The resulting curve can be then compared with existing models, trying different pair potential. Attractive interactions or biphasic samples induce an increase of the intensity at low
q , whereas a decrease of the intensity is the signature of repulsive interactions. In
Figure
13‐13
an example of aggregation and attractive interaction in lamellar phase is presented. The lamellar
L
α
phase is made by dilution in D 2 O of AOT, an anionic surfactant with C 12 E 4 , a nonionic surfactant (molar surfactant ratio 1:1). For a total volume fraction of surfactant of 24%, micelles and
L
α
are in osmotic equilibrium, the sample is slightly turbid and a
q
−3
upturn is observed at low
q . As soon as the single-phase regime is reached, the low
q
intensity strongly decreases. On the other hand, in
Figure
13‐14
, the lowering of the low q intensity is due to the repulsive interaction between charged micelles. The red curve represents the fitted form factor and the green one is the experimental structure factor.

Most of the expressions are calculated in the frame of statistical mechanics and liquid state theory for particles with spherical symmetry and interacting with a symmetric potential. The pair correlation function
g ( r ) is calculated by means of the Ornstein–Zernike integral equations with an additional equation known as the closure equation to describe the pair potential of the system under investigation. The wide variety of colloids yields to very different kind of interactions from hard sphere to long-range soft potentials. There are only few cases where an analytical expression exists. For all the others, numerical calculations need to be performed. For hard-sphere systems, the expression is calculated with the Perkus–Yevick approximation for the closure relation. The system is fully described by the hard sphere radius and volume ( R
SH
and
Φ
SH ) [ 61 ]. A widely used analytic expression for charged colloids in a repulsive screened Coulomb potential has been given by Hayter and Penfold in 1981, where the OZ equation is solved in the Mean Spherical Approximation theory (MSA) [ 62 ]. The equations are mainly valid in the case of relatively high colloid concentrations. In 1982, the model has been extended to dilute systems. The new closure equation is known as the “Rescaled Mean Spherical Approximation” (RMSA) [ 63 ]. The model has been successfully applied for charged micelles or colloids. The variable parameters are the ionic strength ( c
s ), the volume fraction ( Φ ), the colloid charge ( σ ), and the radius ( R ). Some of these parameters are known from the sample preparation ( c
s
, Φ ). In many cases, the radius can be extracted from the form factor. Then structure factor fitting allows one to estimate the rate of counter-ion dissociation or the screening length, for example. Important progresses in the understanding of counter-ion role have been so realized and compared to behavior described by the Hofmeister series. 6 Instrument Resolution and Polydispersity In the latter chapter, ideal form factors have been presented. However, in most of the cases, these form factors do not fit the experimental data as well as expected. Instrument resolution and polydispersity of the scatterers have to be introduced in the model [ 64 ,
65 ]. Here, the effect of instrumental resolution and polydispersity will be compared. To illustrate the effects, the model of a spherical shell is used: the outer radius
R
1
is fixed at 220 Å and layer thickness at 20 Å ( 45 ). Δ ρ
is set at 1 so that
P ( 0 ) = 1. A background of 10 −3
is added to cut the very deep oscillations at large
q
(down to 10 −8 ), to reduce the amplitude of the intensity axis and to see better the differences between the simulations. The resolution is the uncertainty of the measured
q
value and indicates the possibility to resolve sharp features such as oscillations or Bragg peaks. As shown below, Δ q/q
depends partially on the wavelength spread, which is quite different between time-of-flight and steady-state instruments. The following considers only the latter kind of instruments. Resolution calculation for time-of-flight spectrometers is detailed in [ 66 ]. The smearing of the ideal scattered intensity has three factors: the finite size of the incident beam, the wavelength resolution, and the pixel size on the detector [ 65 ]. Only the first two points will be considered since the pixel size (max 10 × 10 mm 2 ) has a negligible effect. The
q -resolution at a given q may be written according to a Taylor expansion as: $${\rm \Delta} q = - q\left( {{{\delta \lambda } \over \lambda }} \right) + \left( {{{4\pi } \over \lambda }} \right)\cos \theta {\rm \Delta} \theta .$$
((58))
Hence, $$\eqalign{{\rm \Delta} q^2 & = q^2 \left( {{{\delta \lambda } \over \lambda }} \right)^2 + \left( {{{4\pi } \over \lambda }} \right)^2 \cos ^2 \theta {\rm \Delta} \theta ^2 = {\rm \Delta} q^2 \left( \lambda \right) + {\rm \Delta} q^2 \left( \theta \right) \cr & = q^2 \left[ {\left( {{1 \over {2\sqrt {2\ln 2} }}{{{\rm \Delta} \lambda } \over \lambda }} \right)^2 } \right] + \left[ {\left( {{{4\pi } \over \lambda }} \right)^2 - q^2 } \right]{\rm \Delta} \theta ^2 . }$$
((59))
Δ λ/λ
is related to the FWHM (full width at half maximum) value of the triangular function describing the wavelength distribution by FWHM =
λ
0
(Δ λ/λ ). Δ θ
is related the width of the direct beam ( Figure
13‐15
). A detailed description of Δ λ/λ
(δ λ/λ ) and Δ θ
is given in Appendix (6.7). Figure 13‐15 Contributions of Δ

From ( 59 ), one can see clearly that Δ q
2
depends on the wavelength spread and also on
q
value. The contribution from Δ θ
is quasi-constant versus
q , the one from
λ
increases with
q.
At low
q
(<10 −2
Å −1 ), the uncertainly is dominated by the distribution in angle. At large
q -values, Δ q
is due to the wavelength spread. The resolution function
R(q ′ , q , Δ q ) describes the distribution of the
q
vectors at a given instrumental configuration. The experimental intensity

((60))
Assuming a Gaussian function for the resolution, ( 60 ) yields: $$I_{\exp } \left( q \right) = \int_{q' \to - \infty }^{q' \to + \infty } {{1 \over {{\rm \Delta} q\sqrt {2\pi } }}\exp \left( { - {{\left( {q' - q} \right)^2 } \over {2\left( {{\rm \Delta} q} \right)^2 }}} \right)I(q){\rm{d}}q'}.$$
((61))
In practice, the range of integration
q ′  −   ∞ ,
q ′  +   ∞
is replaced by
q ′   −   a ,
q ′  +   a
where
a
depends on the width of the Gaussian function, i.e., on Δ q
2 . The higher Δ q
2 , the larger is the integration range which has to be used. A too small integration range would yield to an underestimation of the smearing, particularly at high
q , where the function is broader. 6.1 Effect of the Beam Divergence and Size: θ Resolution As shown in ( 76 ), Δ θ
varies between 8 × 10 −4
and 2.6 × 10 −3

. In insert, a zoom of the low
q
region is presented; the direct beam width is compared to the width of the first oscillation of the ideal form factor and the resulting smeared curve is drawn. The direct beam size has a large influence at small angles inducing an intensity decrease of the plateau and smoothing the first oscillations with a shift of the minima toward higher

Distribution In Figure  13-17 , one sees that on such a sample, the effects are most noticeable for Δ λ/λ  > 20%. Above this value, the oscillations vanish. Below 20%, the oscillations are still visible but a broadening is observed. In contrast with the

are important at large

6.3 Smearing Examples 6.3.1 Evidence of Wavelength Spread on Bragg Peaks A simple and easy experiment to demonstrate the wavelength spread is to use a polycrystalline sample, giving narrow Bragg peaks, with several orders at large angles (>0.1 Å −1 ). For example, tetradecanol, octadenol [ 67 ], or silver behenate [ 68 ] are currently used for
q -range calibration and give their first order Bragg peak at
q
b
= 0.1583, 0.1521, and 0.10763 Å −1 , respectively. In this range of
q
larger than 0.1 Å −1
the uncertainty in
q
is mainly governed by the wavelength spread ( Figure
13‐15
). At the position of
n
th
Bragg peak, ( 59 ) becomes: $${\rm \Delta} q_b^{n2} = n^2 {\rm \Delta} q_b ^2 \left( \lambda \right) + {\rm \Delta} q_b^{n2} \left( \theta \right).$$
((62))
For this experiment silver behenate was used. Silver behenate was purchased from Johnson Matthey chemicals and used without further treatment, but kept in a dry dark place. Three wavelengths 6, 8, and 10 Å have been used. In

D  = 2 m, and
C  = 14.4 m is presented. Three Bragg peaks are visible. In insert, the width of the peaks normalized σ 1 in intensity is compared. Figure 13‐18 Scattering curve of silver behenate. In insert, the three Bragg peaks are normalized σ 1 in intensity to evidence the enlargement of the peaks due to the wavelength spread Full size image
The Bragg peaks are fitted with a Gaussian function given
\(\left( {{\rm \Delta} q_b^n } \right)_{\exp }\)
equals to 0.0066, 0.011, 0.017 Å −2
for
n  = 1, 2, and 3, respectively. A full series of measurements at different wavelengths and collimations and calculation details are presented in [ 69 ]. In powder diffraction, the width of the Bragg peak and the enlargement is related to the mosaicity. In soft condensed matter for lamellar phases, the Bragg peak shape is related to bending constant and elasticity of bilayer. The presented example shows the importance of the knowledge of the instrument resolution for accurate determination of parameters. Inversely, a well-known crystal with a very small mosaicity giving sharp Bragg peaks can be used to determine the wavelength spread. 6.3.2 Importance of the Choice of Instrument Configurations The choice of instrument configuration can strongly affect the data analysis. An example is given in
Figure
13‐19
. Calibrated monodisperse latex particles were purchased by Aldrich (ref cat 46,169-5,
R

D  = 17.6 and
C  = 17.6 m for the low angles and
D  = 5.6 and
C  = 5.6 m, with a wavelength
λ  = 6 Å. The scattering curves are shifted of a factor of 5 in intensity. The form factor oscillations are clearly visible in the low
q
configuration, whereas, they are totally smeared in the other configuration where only the curve envelop is seen. In such case, data fitting gives very large uncertainly on the radius, around 40% and sometimes never converges.

F

G ( R

x
is the parameter characterizing the width of the distribution: $$I_{{\rm{poly}}} \left( {q,R_2 } \right) = \int_0^\infty \!\!\!{G(R_2 ,r,x)I(q,r_2 )\,{\rm{d}}r} .$$

Gaussian, log-normal functions or Schultz distribution are often used to represent the size spread, around an average value

The log-normal distribution is equal to:

The root mean square deviation from the mean is
\({\rm \sigma} = R_2 /\left( {Z + 1} \right)^{{1 \mathord{\left/{\vphantom {1 2}} \right.} 2}}\) . The maximum of the curve is found at
\(R = ZR_2 /\left( {Z + 1} \right).\)
The three functions are plotted in

R

is fixed at 200 Å. For the log-normal and the Schultz functions, the maximum of the curves are slightly smaller than
R

\(G(R_2 )\exp ( - {1 \mathord{\left/{\vphantom {1 {2)}}} \right.} {2)}}\) are related by: $${\rm \Delta} R_2 \left( {{\rm{Gaussian}}} \right) = {\rm \sigma} _o R_2 \left( {{\rm{L}og} - {\rm{Normal}}} \right) = R_2 /\left( {Z + 1} \right){}^{{1 \mathord{\left/{\vphantom {1 2}} \right.} 2}}({\rm{Schultz}}).$$

Finally, these three expressions yield very similar numerical values ( Figure
13‐20
) and it is certainly not possible to distinguish them by a SANS experiment. In the following, a log-normal law will be used to illustrate the effects of polydispersity. The effect of polydispersity on the form factor of a spherical shell of inner radius of 200 Å is illustrated in

6.5 Instrumental Resolution and Polydispersity If one compares
Figure

and
Figure

, the effects of polydispersity or instrument resolution are very similar. Indeed, mathematically, the smearing equations ( 61 ) and ( 63 ) are similar. An experimental curve results from the smearing of the ideal intensity both by the resolution and the polydispersity functions: $$I_{\exp } \left( {q_{\rm{o}} ,R_2 } \right) = \int_0^\infty {R\left( {q_{\rm{o}} ,q'} \right)} \left\lfloor\int_0^\infty K_cG(R_2,r,{{\rm \Delta}} R_2)F^2(r,q)dr\right\rfloor dq^\prime$$
((68))
As
q
and
R
2
are independent variables, ( 68 ) is also equal to: $$I_{\exp } \left( {q_{\rm{o}} ,R_2 } \right) = \int_{R = 0}^{R \to \infty } {\int_{q \to - \infty }^{q \to + \infty } {K_c R( {q_{\rm{o}} ,q})} } G( {R_2 ,r, {\rm \Delta} R_2} )F^2(r,q){\rm{d}}rdq$$
((69))
Remark: Taking a Gaussian law for the polydispersity, the total resolution function is symmetrical according to the variables
q
and
r . Thus, the smearing effects due to Δ r
o
or Δ q
o
may be equivalent. 6.6 Conclusion The contribution of the instrumental resolution to the scattering pattern is a general question. This knowledge is crucial for the data analysis because instrumental resolution and sample polydispersity have similar smearing effects on the SANS data. Smoothing of the form factor oscillations, broadening of Bragg peaks or of the maxima are observed. Plotting
I ( q ) versus
q
in a log–log representation may show a decrease of the initial slope, due to a smearing by a large direct beam may also be present [ 64 ]. As shown with simulation, 20% is the limiting value above which the smearing effect by the wavelength becomes drastic and yields to a real change in the scattered pattern. The choice of collimation is a compromise between the flux and the resolution that has to be considered for each experiment. 6.7 Appendix: Definition of Δ θ
and Δ λ / λ ; Comparison between Triangle and Gaussian Functions In the entire text, Gaussian functions are used to describe the wavelength and the angular distribution. Define here how the widths Δ x
0
of the Gaussian functions are calculated. Δλ/λ usually given is the FWHM which is different from Δ x
0
Recall that a Gaussian function centered on
x
o
of half width Δ x
0
at the value
$$G(x,x_0 ,{\rm \Delta} x_0 ) = {1 \over {\sqrt {2\pi } {\rm \Delta} x_0 }}\exp \left( {{{ - 1} \mathord{\left/{\vphantom {{ - 1} 2}} \right.} 2}} \right)$$ is given by: $$G\left( {x,x_0 ,{\rm \Delta} x_0 } \right) = {1 \over {\sqrt {2{\rm{\pi }}} {\rm \Delta} x_0 }}\exp \left( { - {{\left( {x - x_0 } \right)^2 } \over {2{\rm \Delta} x_0 ^2 }}} \right).$$
((70))
The FWHM of a Gaussian is $${\rm{FWHM}} = 2{\rm \Delta} x_0 \sqrt {2\ln 2} .$$
((71))
6.7.1 Wavelength Distribution The wavelength distribution is ideally triangular but experiments show that Gaussian fits give reasonable results and improve the numerical treatment [ 65 ]. Δ λ/λ
is deduced from the FWHM of the triangular function. It is usually between 5 and 20% with a neutron velocity selector, a value determined by time-of-flight measurements. Gaussian and triangular functions are compared in

λ
o (Δ λ/λ ) is given by: $$\eqalign{ & T \left( \lambda \right) = {1 \over {\left[ {\lambda _0 \left( {{{{\rm \Delta} \lambda } \mathord{\left/{\vphantom {{{\rm \Delta} \lambda } \lambda }} \right.} \lambda }} \right)} \right]^2 }}\lambda + {{\lambda _0 \left( {1 - \left( {{{{\rm \Delta} \lambda } \mathord{\left/{\vphantom {{{\rm \Delta} \lambda } \lambda }} \right.} \lambda }} \right)} \right)} \over {\left[ {\lambda _0 \left( {{{{\rm \Delta} \lambda } \mathord{\left/{\vphantom {{{\rm \Delta} \lambda } \lambda }} \right.} \lambda }} \right)} \right]^2 }};\quad \lambda \le \lambda _0 \cr & T \left( \lambda \right) = {{ - 1} \over {\left[ {\lambda _0 \left( {{{{\rm \Delta} \lambda } \mathord{\left/{\vphantom {{{\rm \Delta} \lambda } \lambda }} \right.} \lambda }} \right)} \right]^2 }}\lambda + {{\lambda _0 \left( {1 + \left( {{{{\rm \Delta} \lambda } \mathord{\left/{\vphantom {{{\rm \Delta} \lambda } \lambda }} \right.} \lambda }} \right)} \right)} \over {\left[ {\lambda _0 \left( {{{{\rm \Delta} \lambda } \mathord{\left/{\vphantom {{{\rm \Delta} \lambda } \lambda }} \right.} \lambda }} \right)} \right]^2 }};\quad \lambda \ge \lambda _0 \cr}$$
((72))
The calculation uses a Gaussian function where the relevant parameter is σ
λ
, the half width at the value
\({1 \over {\sqrt {2\pi } {\rm \sigma} _\lambda }}\exp \left( {{{ - 1} \mathord{\left/{\vphantom {{ - 1} 2}} \right.} 2}} \right)\) . Replace the triangular function by a Gaussian one with the same FWHM. From ( 71 ), one deduces: $${\rm \sigma} _\lambda = {{\lambda _0 \left( {{{{\rm \Delta} \lambda } \mathord{\left/{\vphantom {{{\rm \Delta} \lambda } \lambda }} \right.} \lambda }} \right)} \over {2\sqrt {2\ln 2} }}.$$
((73))
Thus, the relative wavelength spread introduces in ( 59 ) is: $$\left( {{{\delta \lambda } \mathord{\left/{\vphantom {{\delta \lambda } \lambda }} \right.} \lambda }} \right) = {{\left( {{{{\rm \Delta} \lambda } \mathord{\left/{\vphantom {{{\rm \Delta} \lambda } \lambda }} \right.} \lambda }} \right)} \over {2\sqrt {2\ln 2} }}.$$
((74))
6.7.2 Angular Distribution The angular distribution Δ θ
is deduced from the width of the direct beam. For
q  = 0,
θ
= 0 and ( 58 ) is reduced to: $${\rm \Delta} q\left( 0 \right) = {{4\pi } \over \lambda }{\rm \Delta} \theta .$$
((75))
On D22, the measurements show that reasonable fits are obtained with a Gaussian function, even if deviation is observed in the tails. In these conditions Δ q (0) is equivalent to Δ x
0
in (70) and one easily deduce Δ θ
with (75). Example of experimental direct beam shapes for
λ  = 6 Å at various collimation distances
C
are presented in

13‐23
. Figure 13‐23 Shape and size of the direct beam of D22 at
λ  = 6 Å for the different possible collimation distances. Dotted lines are a guide for the eyes Full size image
Δ θ
can also be calculated in a theoretical way from the geometry of the instrument. It is a function of: source diameter ( S
1 ), diameter of the aperture in front of the sample ( S
2 ), collimation ( C ), and sample-to-detector ( D ) distances. Details of calculations are given in [ 67 ,
68 ]. As a crude approximation, Δ θ
can be estimated with: $${\rm \Delta} \theta = {{S_1 } \mathord{\left/{\vphantom {{S_1 } C}} \right.} C}.$$

7 Present Future and Perspective 7.1 Recent Developments The new generation of SANS diffractometers like D22 at the ILL (Institut Laue Langevin, Grenoble) with very high flux at the sample position (up to 10 8
neutrons/s/cm 2 ) combined with a large sensitive detector area permit very short acquisition times of the order of a few hundreds of milliseconds [ 72 ]. The development of new experiments is closely related to instrument improvement and development of new sophisticated sample environments. Great progress has been realized in the detector field and electronics as already presented in
Section
2
. In the last few years, complex environments such as stopped-flow device, shear apparatus, extruder equipment, and flash light opened the possibility of new kind of investigations. The last decade has seen the development of kinetics experiments. By rapid, one means acquisition of the order of hundred milliseconds in order to reach the early stages of formation of a sample. Real-time means a movie of the sample, just after a perturbation (dilution, pH jump, temperature change, application of a magnetic field, etc.). The knowledge of the early stage of sample formation can be crucial to understand and act on the equilibrium state. One crucial step with such experiments is to trigger the acquisition with the experimental setup to insure the reproducibility of the measurement. Small acquisition times require repeating several times the experiment and adding data to increase the statistics. Real-time experiments carried out with the stopped-flow technique have allowed the study of intermediary or metastable states during the formation of vesicles [ 73 – 75 ], or to measure characteristic times for formation and growth of mesoporous materials [ 76 ]. In a recent experiment, the changes of conformation of the Photoactive Yellow Protein were followed during 1.053 s after illumination by a flash light [ 17 ]. The first acquisition time was only 50 ms, a time competitive with what is done on SAXS instruments on synchrotron sources. The analysis by IFT has shown an increase of the radius of gyration corresponding to an opening of the conformation just after illumination followed by a return to the equilibrium state within a second. 7.2 Future Developments 7.2.1 Interactive Instrument Control The future of SANS experiments will require the development of new “intelligent” softwares that will be able not only to control the instrument and to set the configurations but also to pilot the acquisition. A major question, for example, is how to optimize the acquisition time by keeping good statistics. Future software will be able to calculate on line statistics and errors and to stop the acquisition when given conditions defined by the scientist (for example, a given number of neutrons) will be reached. 7.2.2 Lenses and Focusing The limiting factors in neutron experiments are the flux, the smallest scattering vector ( q
min ), and the resolution, three parameters that can be linked and simultaneously improved if focusing devices would exist. The recent investigations consist in sets of biconcave lenses installed just before the sample [ 77 ]. Very encouraging results have been obtained as described by Choi et al. [ 78 ] with test experiments carried out on the 30-m SANS instrument at NIST [ 78 ]. The authors show the gain of flux, of minimum
q
and resolution after correction of chromatic aberration due to gravity. Nevertheless, some restrictions must be pointed out [ 79 ]. Mainly, such equipment decreases the instrument flexibility such as it is optimized for one wavelength and one sample-to-detector distance which must match the focusing point. Sets of MgF Compound Refractive Lens (CRL) are available on D22 (obtained from PSI). Installed after the sample position they were used to magnify the sample. Example are given in [ 80 ] obtained with Al CRL. 7.2.3 Ultra Small-Angle Scattering (USANS) At very low
q
SANS experiments meet the limits of light scattering experiments. Micro-size particles can be analyzed by techniques like electronic microscopy, AFM, light scattering or USAXS but in some cases these techniques are not applicable (opaque sample for SALS, low contrast, etc.). USANS offers the possibility to investigate very large structures. Worm-like micelles, microemulsions, colloidal crystals, porous material as found in cement or rocks are possible applications in USANS. USANS instruments can cover a
q -range from 2 10 −4
to 5 10 −3
Å −1 . They operate mainly according two principles. The Bonse–Hart setup consists in two channel-cut perfect crystals mounted in parallel, one is the monochromator, the second one is the analyzer and the sample is positioned in between. The  q -dependence of the scattered intensity is measured by rocking the crystals [ 78 ]. Bonse–Hart-type instruments exist on PCD at the NIST (USA), on S18 at the ILL (France), on ECHO at SINQ (Switzerland), on KWS-3 in the FZ-Jülich (Germany), and will also be built in Jaeri the new spallation source in Japan. The second possible setup is a pinhole geometry, where the beam is collimated in the two directions by a series of small diaphragms or slits. This geometry has been selected at the LLB (France) for the instrument “TPA” in commissioning at the date of this review [ 83 ] [ 84 ]. One main limiting factor in USANS experiments is the low flux at the sample position. Nevertheless the new high flux reactors and spallation sources render the experiments possible. The use of multiple small beams further focused at the sample position is an efficient way to increase the flux. 7.2.4 Polarization and SANS Some SANS spectrometers Footnote
1
offer now a polarization option opening new possible fields of research. The polarization has a strong influence on the contrast between nuclear and magnetic scattering contribution. The incident polarized beam is produced by a supermirror. Polarization alone can be used as a way to vary the contrast of the sample. The principle of a “polarization plus analysis” experiment consists in applying a magnetic field to the sample and to analyze the spin states before and after the scattering. Complementary to conventional SANS, additional information magnetization profiles in samples are obtained. Recent outcomes on ferrofluids are described in [ 16 ]. Another application comes from the large spin-dependent scattering length from
1 H. Consequently, polarized SANS can find strong application in soft condensed matter and biology where hydrogen is a main component. Contrast variation can be done once again using hydrogen
1 H and deuterium
2 H which exhibit strong differences in spin-dependence [ 82 ]. Nanotechnologies using magnetism and new biotechnologies will certainly benefit from polarized SANS, opening new approaches for the sample characterization. 7.3 General Conclusion SANS is a powerful technique to analyze the size, the shape, the intra- and interstructures of complex systems with typical size ranging from a few nanometres down to tenths of a micrometer. The lowest flux and the larger beam size compared to X-ray source is balanced by the unique feature of isotopic substitution which has been of particular importance in the understanding of biological systems. In comparison with light or X-ray scattering, small-angle neutron scattering is a relatively recent technique, still in evolution. Technical progresses are also closely linked to electronics improvements. Progress in computing permits more and more accurate fittings with numerical resolution of nonlinear equations involved in theoretical models. SALS, SAXS, and SANS techniques are not in competition but really complementary. Moreover microscopy techniques (in the real space) are often carried out in parallel to validate the models deduced from scattering experiments. Reference [ 41 ] illustrates nicely the complementarities of freeze-fracture electron microscopy and SANS. The increasing number of proposals submitted per year demonstrates the relevance of this technique. The future developments and the broad field of research investigated insure a bright future for SANS experiments.

Abstract
In this work, we rationalize the chemical pathways and kinetics of the crystallization of methylammonium lead iodide hybrid perovskite. Our approach includes a combination of analysis of solvent coordination, the structure of intermediate solvate phases, and modeling evaporation rates of precursor solutions. The evolution of solution species
via
intermediate solvate phases and into perovskite thin films during drying was monitored by
in situ
grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). All studied precursor solutions exhibited the formation of intermediate solvate phases including a previously unreported GBL phase. In single-solvent solutions, crystallization kinetics are determined by the solvent evaporation rate and saturation concentration required for nucleation. In binary solvent mixtures, the evaporation rate of solutions is dominated by the most volatile solvent which leads to unequal evaporation of the components of the mixture. The structure of the intermediate phases in such systems strongly depends on the coordination strength and the availability of solvents upon nucleation. The combined approach described in this work allows predicting the kinetics and the chemical pathways of crystallization of hybrid perovskites in complex solvent mixtures. This insight is of great importance for future perovskite ink design.

Abstract Control over morphology and crystallinity of metal halide perovskite films is of key importance to enable high-performance optoelectronics. However, this remains particularly challenging for solution-printed devices due to the complex crystallization kinetics of semiconductor materials within dynamic flow of inks. Here we report a simple yet effective meniscus-assisted solution printing (MASP) strategy to yield large-grained dense perovskite film with good crystallization and preferred orientation. Intriguingly, the outward convective flow triggered by fast solvent evaporation at the edge of the meniscus ink imparts the transport of perovskite solutes, thus facilitating the growth of micrometre-scale perovskite grains. The growth kinetics of perovskite crystals is scrutinized by
in situ
optical microscopy tracking to understand the crystallization mechanism. The perovskite films produced by MASP exhibit excellent optoelectronic properties with efficiencies approaching 20% in planar perovskite solar cells. This robust MASP strategy may in principle be easily extended to craft other solution-printed perovskite-based optoelectronics.

Introduction Solution printing is widely recognized as an attractive route to cost-effective, high-throughput and large-area thin film optoelectronics 1 , 2 , 3 . In this technique, the ink solution containing semiconductor precursors or nanoparticles can be readily deposited on a variety of desirable substrates, offering precise control over stoichiometry and rendering ubiquitous adaptability and compatibility with patterned and flexible substrates 4 . As state-of-the-art direct bandgap semiconductors, metal halide perovskites capitalize on superior optoelectronic characteristics such as intense broadband absorption, large ambipolar mobility, long charge carrier lifetime, and low processing cost compared with inorganic counterparts (e.g., silicon, CIGS and CdTe) 5 , 6 . The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solution-processed metal halide perovskite solar cells has rapidly leapfrogged from 3.8% to 22.1% over the past several years 7 , 8 . Notably, top-performing perovskite solar cells have recently been advanced largely by optimizing the crystal morphology of methylammonium lead halides (MAPbX 3 , X=I, Br and Cl), formamidinium lead halides (FAPbX 3 ), and their combinations 9 , 10 , 11 . However, the requirement of morphology control has posed a great challenge for solution-printed perovskite films due to the limited understanding of crystallization in dynamic flow of perovskite inks. It is important to note that photoluminescence spectroscopy has revealed that the trap-assisted non-radiative charge recombination dominates the efficiency loss in perovskite solar cells 12 , 13 . The existence of charge traps is strongly associated with the disorder of crystals caused by ionized impurities, lattice vacancies and interstices and grain-boundary defects within perovskite film 14 . Through improving the crystallization, charge traps inside high-crystallinity perovskites exist at shallow states, yet deep traps are still massively present near the grain boundary region 15 . Recently, several solution-processed routes to micrometre-sized perovskite grains by crafting films at high temperatures (for example, spin coating at 180 °C for MAPbI 3(1− x ) Cl 3 x
and doctor-blading at 145 °C for FA x MA 1− x PbI 3 , 0≤ x ≤1) have been successfully implemented to reduce the areas of grain boundary and minimize the trap-induced energy loss 16 , 17 . One notion behind these effective approaches is that the grain-boundary motion depends strongly on the temperature, and a high temperature can stimulate solute atoms more easily to overcome the diffusion energy barrier, thus resulting in fast grain growth rate 18 , 19 . Nevertheless, solution printing may not be amenable to high-temperature preparative conditions that are close to the boiling point,
T bp , of typical solvents used for dissolving perovskites (for example, dimethylformamide (DMF),
T bp, DMF = ∼ 152 °C; dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO),
T bp, DMSO = ∼ 189 °C), as the ink solution is too volatile to render the control over the crystal morphology. In addition to increased energy consumption, high-temperature treatment is also likely to cause thermal degradation and thermo-mechanical fatigue of perovskite and electrode materials, especially for flexible electrodes such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) 20 . Clearly, a low-temperature strategy for morphological control of solution-printed perovskite films is highly desirable, which has yet to be explored. Here we report on a versatile meniscus-assisted solution printing (MASP) strategy to create highly crystallized perovskite films with micrometre-scale grains and preferred crystal orientations at low temperatures for high-efficiency perovskite solar cells. Specifically, a meniscus is formed due to capillary action by constraining the perovskite ink between a lower substrate and an upper plate. The fast solvent evaporation at the edge (that is, the air/perovskite ink/lower substrate three-phase contact line) of the meniscus triggers an outward convective flow to replenish the evaporative loss of solvent and meanwhile transports the perovskite solutes toward the contact line due to the coffee ring effect 21 , 22 , 23 . This yields a perovskite supersaturated phase containing continually aggregated solutes, promoting the nucleation and growth of perovskite crystals. Through placing the lower substrate on a programmed translational stage, the receding meniscus can be slowly and progressively swept across the entire lower substrate, thereby printing a continuous perovskite film on the substrate. We note that the MASP deposition is inspired by solution-coating techniques in the field of organic semiconductor processing 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 . For solution-based coating of metal halide perovskite materials, doctor-blade coating has been widely employed to deposit perovskite thin films or microwires for optoelectronic applications 28 , 29 . In contrast to the deposition of perovskite solutes by doctor-blade coating with which the solvent evaporation is driven by applying high temperatures 28 , 29 , 30 , MASP promotes the perovskite crystallization by accelerating the solvent evaporation through the meniscus effect. The crystallization mechanism of perovskite films crafted by MASP is revealed by in-situ optical microscopy investigation into the crystal growth kinetics. As such, it provides insights into the precise control over the crystal morphology and crystallinity of perovskite films. The produced perovskite films possess preferred crystal orientations and enhanced optoelectronic properties. A high PCE approaching 20% is achieved in the planar perovskite solar cells assembled using the MASP-enabled perovskite films as the photoactive layers. Results Outward convective flow within meniscus perovskite ink A complex stoichiometry of FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
containing two mixed organic cations (that is, FA 0.85 MA 0.15 ) and two mixed halides (that is, I 2.55 Br 0.45 ) is selected as the perovskite material because of its enhanced efficiency and stability as compared to MAPbI 3
(ref.
31 ). In particular, FAPbI 3
has a lower bandgap than that of MAPbI 3
and thus is beneficial for increasing light harvesting, and MAPbBr 3
improves the stability of the FAPbI 3
perovskite phase. A scheme of crafting large perovskite crystal grains by MASP is illustrated in
Fig. 1a . The metal halide perovskite ink FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
in DMSO was loaded in a two-nearly-parallel-plate geometry where the lower flat substrate can be moved against the upper stationary plate in a programmable manner. The separation distance between these two plates was fixed at 300 μm to form a concave meniscus held by capillary force. An important signature of capillary action is the presence of a meniscus at the edge of the confined ink.
Figure 1b
shows a representative side-view optical micrograph of confined meniscus ink, where the velocity of outward convective flow
v
induced by solvent evaporation can be described by Navier-Stokes equation with the lubrication approximation ( Supplementary Note 1 ) 22 , 32 : Figure 1: Meniscus-assisted solution printing of FA 0.85 >MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45

t
is time,
ρ
is the density of solution,
r
is the horizontal distance of the meniscus surface away from the bulk ink, and
h
is the height of the meniscus at
r . As the volume of loaded ink is sufficient for completing the printing process, the shape of the meniscus remains relatively unchanged with time, and thus the
∂
h/
∂
t
term can be neglected. Equation (1) can then be simplified as: We fitted the experimentally measured outline of the meniscus with a parabolic equation
h = a ·( R − r ) b , where
h
is dependent on the moving speed of the lower substrate (that is, the coating speed of perovskite). The theoretical fit agreed well the experimental meniscus outline (that is, the red dashed curve in
Fig. 1b ). The evaporative flux
J e
can be described by the non-equilibrium one-sided (NEOS) model ( Supplementary Note 1 ) 33 : where

W
is the thermal effect given by
( k
is the liquid thermal conductivity,
k s
is the thermal conductivity of substrate,
d 0
is the liquid thickness and
d s
is the thickness of substrate). By combining Equation (3) with Equation (2), the outward flow velocity
v
as a function of the distance
r
away from the bulk ink can be obtained: According to Equations (3) and (4), we can derive that the outward convective flow increases sharply at the meniscus edge ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ), as the solvent evaporation is faster toward the edge of the meniscus ink, correspondingly transporting the solutes to the meniscus front and leading to the perovskite supersaturated phase at the edge. Process of meniscus-assisted solution printing As a result, FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
solutes gradually precipitate out from the supersaturated phase and grow into large crystals as the outward flow continuously transport more solutes to the edge of the meniscus. A real-time tracking of the perovskite crystal growth by optical microscopy is shown in
Fig. 1c , depicting the evolution of a perovskite nucleus into a large-grained microstructure ( Supplementary Movie 1 ). At time
t 0 , a relatively small perovskite grain (marked with the white arrow) appeared in the front of meniscus ink with an effective diameter of
∼ 4 μm. As time progressed (that is, from

t 0 +7 s), the grain underwent a two-dimensional (2D) growth to a large crystal island ( Supplementary Fig. 2a ). Eventually, the grain growth slowed down when it was connected with other adjacent grains (that is,
t 0 +12 s), accompanied by the coalescence of neighbouring grains ( Supplementary Fig. 2b ). We note that the perovskite grain growth is expected to initially follow a normal three-dimensional (3D) mode before its size becomes comparable to the film thickness (that is,
∼ 900 nm,
Supplementary Fig. 3 ) 18 . However, the grain size at the initial stage was too small to be accurately seen and tracked by optical microscopy. Once the grain size exceeded the film thickness, the perpendicular growth was suppressed due to the specimen thickness effect in thin films 35 , resulting in the observed 2D growth. The lower substrate mounted on the translational stage was moved at a constant speed of 12 μm s −1
in the direction opposite to the receding meniscus. As a result, the evaporative front progressively swept across the entire substrate to print a continuous film composed of large perovskite grains ( Supplementary Movie 2 ), and no stick-slip motion was observed.
Figure 1d
shows a representative scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the perovskite film crafted by MASP, revealing that FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite grains with a size of 20–80 μm were densely packed together without observable voids at grain boundaries. A low-magnification SEM image in
Supplementary Fig. 4a
further displays a uniform morphology over a few millimetres. We observed that a uniform morphology can only be achieved when the coating speed
v c
(that is,
v c =12 μm s −1 ) was close to the receding speed of the meniscus edge due to solvent evaporation. When the coating speed (for example,
v c =2 μm s −1 ) was slower than the meniscus receding speed, the meniscus edge was found to quickly reach the edge of the upper plate. As a result, the perovskite crystals bridged the upper plate and the lower substrate ( Supplementary Fig. 4b ). On the other hand, when the coating speed (for example,
v c =50 μm s −1 ) was faster than the meniscus receding speed, a liquid layer rather than a solid film was coated on the substrate. The liquid layer then dried to form discontinuous perovskite crystals as shown in
Supplementary Fig. 4c . Recently, a physical model has been built to predict the optimal window for the coating speed by estimating the equilibrium front evaporation speed
v efe
in the evaporation regime of meniscus coating 36 . We employ this model to further analyse the influence of the substrate temperature, the boiling point of solvent, the solvent density, and the meniscus geometrical factor in the MASP process on the front evaporation speed of DMSO ( Supplementary Note 2 ). The calculated
v efe
of DMSO at 60 °C is 4 μm s −1
( Supplementary Fig. 5a ) and the optimized coating speed
v c
we used in MASP was 12 μm s −1 , thus the normalized coating speed
= v c / v efe =3, suggesting that this model may be able to predict the optimal window of the coating speed via estimating the front solvent evaporation rate. In addition, we found that there was also an optimal substrate temperature (that is,
T= 60±10 °C) for depositing uniform FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite films by MASP. Following this optimal operation window (that is,
v c =12 μm s −1
and
T =60 °C), the two-nearly-parallel-plate geometry, the substrate temperature, and the coating speed were thus fixed. We can adjust the film thickness by simply varying the perovskite precursor solution concentration.
Supplementary Fig. 5b
shows the thickness of MASP-deposited FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite film as a function of the solution concentration. We also characterized the morphology of the spin-coated FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite film as reference. The SEM image showed that the spin-coated perovskite film comprised the nanoscale grains with a size of 50–300 nm ( Supplementary Fig. 6a ). The cross-sectional SEM image revealed a typical film thickness of 780±20 nm ( Supplementary Fig. 6b ). The elemental mapping of the spin-coated FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite film was measured by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), verifying that the spin-coated film had a uniform composition dispersion (that is, Pb, Br and I) ( Supplementary Fig. 7 ). The presence of high-quality micrometre-sized grains within these large FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite grains was corroborated by the well-defined selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (that is, selected area size=2 μm,
Supplementary Fig. 8 ) shown as an inset in
Fig. 1d , which can be attributed to a trigonal perovskite crystal with the (110) plane preferentially parallel to the substrate ( Supplementary Method 1 ;
Supplementary Fig. 9 ) 37 . However, the spin-coated FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite film showed ring-type SAED patterns ( Supplementary Fig. 10 ), implying that there was no preferred crystal orientation and the film had a polycrystalline structure. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles of the FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite film prepared by MASP and the reference sample prepared by spin coating are shown in
Fig. 1e . All diffraction peak positions of these two films agreed well with the simulated XRD profile of a trigonal perovskite crystal with the space group
P 3 m 1. Notably, the relative intensity ratio of ( 40)/(024) to ( 11) was increased for the film prepared by MASP, implying that the MASP film possessed the preferred crystal orientation along the < 20>/<012> direction ( Supplementary Method 2 ;
Supplementary Fig. 11 ). In particular, the <012>-oriented FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
trigonal crystal forms a corner-sharing lead halide octahedral network with a long-range order ( Supplementary Fig. 9d ), which is an ideal structure for effective charge transport across the perovskite film 38 . It is noteworthy that the high-purity trigonal perovskite crystals were directly formed at a relatively low temperature (that is, 60 °C) by MASP ( Supplementary Fig. 12 ), thereby dispensing with the need for high-temperature treatment in the spin-coated films in order to convert the DMSO-incorporated intermediate to perovskite phase ( Supplementary Note 3 ). We also note that the diffraction peak positions of the FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite film prepared by MASP were not completely the same as those prepared by spin coating. For example, there is a small right shift of 2 θ =0.26 o
for the ( ) peak in the spin-coated film. The differences in the diffraction peak positions suggested that the stoichiometry of the perovskite films prepared by MASP and spin coating may be slightly different. Thus, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed to identify the chemical composition of perovskite films. Clearly, the perovskite film prepared by MASP had the real chemical composition of (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.14
( Supplementary Fig. 13 ), which was almost consistent with the stoichiometry of the perovskite precursors in the ink. However, for the spin-coated perovskite film, the real chemical composition was found to be (FAPbI 3 ) 0.82 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.13.
The MASP technique not only entail a relatively low-temperature deposition of FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite films with high crystallinity, but also facilitate the formation of micrometer-scale perovskite grains with preferred crystal orientations. Conceivably, the resulting perovskite films may demonstrate advantageous optoelectronic properties. Growth kinetics of perovskite crystals To further understand the crystallization mechanism of perovskites crafted by MASP, we turn our attention to scrutinize the growth kinetics of FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
crystals by real-time optical microscopy measurement.
Figure 2a
depicts the area of the tracked FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
crystal island as a function of time. A two-stage crystal growth is observed, namely, a quadratic increase of crystal area with time at the early stage of growth and a linear increase of crystal area with time at the late stage. It is worth noting that this growth pattern is analogous to the vacuum deposition of organic crystals on substrate 39 , 40 , except that the atom transferring medium in MASP is a liquid flow. In this context, we examine the perovskite crystal growth kinetics according to the scaling capture zone model 41 , 42 , in which the crystal growth is essentially governed by the accessible collection area for solutes and the solute diffusion length 41 . The accessible collection area of the FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
crystal island can be estimated by its Voronoi cell that included all solutes closer to this specific island than to any others 43 . The central point of each island (that is, red dots in
Fig. 2b,c ) is labelled as the nucleation centre to diagram the Voronoi cell. The good agreement between the Voronoi cell topographies and the obtained perovskite island shapes suggests a strong correlation between the crystal growth and the accessible collection area 40 . At the early growth stage of the FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite island with its centre labelled as P ( Fig. 2b ), the effective radius
R eff
of the island was relatively small (that is,
R eff,t0
= ∼ 4 μm at time
t 0 ), the Voronoi cell radius
R Vor
of the island at time
t 0
was very large (that is,
R Vor,t0 >100 μm) as it was isolated far from other neighbouring crystals. In the case of
R eff + δ < R Vor , the crystal growth rate was mainly determined by the solute diffusion length
δ
toward the island, and thus a quadratic crystal growth emerged and can be described by d A/ d t=k q (2π δ
R eff +πδ 2 ), where
A=π
is the island area, and
k q
is the rate constant 39 , 44 . The value of
δ
was then derived by fitting the measured island size to the quadratic growth equation, yielding
δ =4 μm. We note that the EDS measurement showed a uniform elemental mapping of the FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite island ( Supplementary Fig. 14 ), suggesting that the diffusion lengths of various solutes (that is, FA, MA, Pb, I and Br) were possibly comparable and did not generate obvious composition segregation in perovskite crystals during MASP. The evaporation-induced outward convective flow is expected to facilitate the solute diffusion and promote the crystal growth rate at this stage. The relationship
R eff + δ < R Vor
changed to
R eff + δ > R Vor,
as the FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite island grew larger (that is,
R eff,t9 = ∼ 51 μm at time
t 0 +9 s). Meanwhile more new adjacent crystals emerged as evidenced in
Fig. 2c , the tracked island had to compete with the neighbours for collecting the perovskite solutes, leading to smaller
R Vor
(that is,
R Vor,t9 = ∼ 48 μm at time
t 0 +9 s). As a result, the crystal growth rate was largely determined by the accessible collection area of the island, giving rise to a linear crystal growth (d A/ d t = k l A Vor , where
A Vor
is the area of the Voronoi cell, and
k l
is the rate constant) 39 , 44 . Figure 2: Growth kinetics of FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45

to

to

perovskites with varied chemical compositions (0.05≤ x ≤0.25), and they all follow the two-stage growth kinetics ( Supplementary Fig. 15 ). In order to further verify the reliability of the observed crystal growth kinetics, we analyse the growth rates of a number of FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
crystal islands (that is, a total of 18 islands shown in
Fig. 2d ) in a single real-time tracking by optical microscopy. As the islands were isolated far from each other at the early stage, only the growth rates at the late stage were monitored, that is, the crystal growth followed the condition of
R eff
+
δ > R Vor . The average crystal growth rate and the corresponding Voronoi cell area of each island from time
to
+3 s were calculated ( Supplementary Fig. 16 ;
Supplementary Movie 3 ). A linear relationship d A/ d t=k l A Vor
was indeed also observed for these islands with varied sizes and growth rates ( Fig. 2e ). The origin of the linear crystal growth is that the solute density varies slowly in the crystallization regime when the solute diffusion rate is comparable with the solute crystallization rate, and the crystallization regime can be approximated as a steady state, thereby enabling the statistics studies of the diffusion equation with appropriate boundary conditions for simple island configuration 42 . On the basis of this crystal growth kinetics, it is suggested that the final size of the perovskite crystals yielded by MASP depends strongly on the nucleation density, and a lower nucleation density facilitates the growth of large crystals due to a fewer competitors for solutes. Furthermore, the nucleation density relies on the evaporation-driven outward convective flow (that is, faster outward flow leading to higher nucleation density) within the meniscus ink, which can be tuned by adjusting the meniscus height, the solvent density, the substrate temperature, and the substrate moving speed 36 , 45 . Optoelectronic performances of perovskites films Intrigued by the attractive features of micrometer-sized grains and preferred crystal orientations, we set out to investigate the photophysical properties of MASP-enabled perovskite films.
Figure 3a
compares the ultraviolet-visible (UV–Vis) absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite film crafted by MASP and the film prepared by spin coating ( Supplementary Method 3 ). The PL peak of the MASP film exhibited a
∼ 20 meV red-shift compared to that of the spin-coated film ( Supplementary Fig. 17a ). Since the Stokes shifts for both films were almost negligible (that is,
∼ 5 meV), accordingly, a red-shift of the absorption onset edge was seen ( Supplementary Fig. 17b and 17c ), implying that the MASP film had a slightly lower bandgap than that of the spin-coated film. Moreover, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the PL spectrum was narrowed by
∼ 26 meV for the MASP film, suggesting that the MASP film contained fewer crystalline defects 16 , 46 . The low Urbach energy (that is,
∼ 19 meV,
Fig. 3b ) further confirmed the presence of reduced localization disordering within the MASP-enabled FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite film 47 . The charge carrier lifetime was measured by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy ( Fig. 3c ). The charge carrier lifetimes in the MASP perovskite film (that is,
τ 1 =70±5 ns and
τ 2 =1,104±251 ns) were much longer than the spin-coated film (that is,
τ ref1 =41±1 ns and
τ ref2 =268±28 ns), indicating a lower trap density within the MASP film. Particularly, the longer lifetime
τ 2
of the MASP film exceeded 1,000 ns, signifying that the trap-induced carrier recombination was appreciably reduced due to the formation of high-quality and large-sized FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite grains by MASP 48 . The charge trap densities within the perovskite films were actually measured from the space charge-limited current (SCLC) devices ( Supplementary Method 4 ) 46 . The charge trap density within the MASP film was estimated to be
∼ 5.74 × 10 12  cm −3
( Fig. 3d ), which was much lower than that of the spin-coated film (that is,
∼ 4.04 × 10 15  cm −3 ;
Supplementary Fig. 18 ), in good agreement with the UV–Vis and PL spectroscopy studies. Taken together, the results noted above substantiate that the MASP method enable the formation of FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite film with good crystallization and low charge traps, offering the remarkable potential to yield high-performance optoelectronic devices. Figure 3: Optoelectronic properties of FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45

Full size image We thus fabricate FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite solar cells via MASP, which allows for direct deposition of a perovskite photoactive layer on the top of the functional electrodes. The effect of perovskite film thickness on the photovoltaic performance is investigated. The film thickness of the MASP perovskite film is varied by adjusting the ink concentration ( Supplementary Fig. 5b ). The corresponding photovoltaic efficiency with the device architecture of FTO/compact-TiO 2 /Perovskite/PTAA/Ag is studied.
Supplementary Fig. 19
compares the current density–voltage ( J – V ) curves of the devices with the perovskite film thickness ranging from
∼ 600 nm to
∼ 1,400 nm. The photovoltaic parameters are summarized in
Supplementary Table 1 . When the film thickness was increased from 620 to 890 nm, the
J sc
and
FF
were increased, resulting in the increase in
PCE
from 15.73 to 18.27%. When the film thickness was further increased to 1,070 nm, the
FF
tended to decrease. Notably, all photovoltaic parameters decreased when the film thickness reached 1,410 nm, probably due to the increased series resistance and charge recombination in the thick film. Thus, the optimal film thickness was fixed at
∼ 900 nm in this work. In this context, the inverted planar solar cells with the device architecture of ITO/PTAA/Perovskite/PCBM/BCP/Ag produced an average PCE of 18.49±0.47% ( Supplementary Table 2 ). The champion cell achieved a PCE of 19.23% with an open-circuit voltage
V oc
of 1.10 V, short-circuit current
J sc
of 22.34 mA cm −2 , and fill factor FF of 78.26% ( Fig. 4a ). A stable output photocurrent density of 20.6 mA cm −2
and PCE of 19.1% of this champion cell were obtained under the standard sunlight ( Fig. 4c ). Compared to inverted planar devices, higher PCEs were achieved in the standard planar devices with the architecture of FTO/compact-TiO 2 /Perovskite/PTAA/Ag, in which the average PCE was 19.22±0.36% ( Supplementary Table 3 ). The champion cell delivered a
V oc
of 1.10 V,
J sc
of 23.20 mA cm −2 , FF of 78.58% and a PCE of 20.05% ( Fig. 4b ). Similarly, the stable output photocurrent density and PCE of the champion cell reached 21.5 mA cm −2
and 19.9% ( Fig. 4d ). The integrated current densities from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were 21.94 and 22.38 mA cm −2
for champion inverted and standard planar devices ( Supplementary Fig. 20 ), respectively, which agreed well with the measured
J sc
values. Compared with those of spin-coated perovskite films ( Supplementary Tables 4 and 5 ), the MASP-enabled standard and inverted planar perovskite solar cells displayed not only high efficiencies with inappreciable hysteresis ( Supplementary Fig. 21 ) but also small s.d. in the average PCEs. This can be attributed to the presence of large-sized, highly-crystallized and preferentially-oriented perovskite grains created by MASP.

Full size image Discussion The stability of FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite solar cells with the device architecture of FTO/compact-TiO 2 /Perovskite/PTAA/Ag fabricated by MASP and spin coating, respectively, is also investigated. The devices are continuously exposed to AM1.5G solar illumination in ambient environment (temperature=25±2 °C and relative humidity=30±8%) without encapsulation. The photovoltaic efficiency is measured at an interval of 12 h.
Figure 5
compares the photovoltaic parameters as a function of time for both MASP-deposited and spin-coated devices (the
J – V
curves were shown in
Supplementary Fig. 22 ). The spin-coated device started to experience the efficiency drop after 12-h continuous illumination and lost 50% of its initial efficiency in 60 h. In contrast, the MASP-deposited device maintained nearly 90% of its initial efficiency after 60-h continuous illumination in air. The efficiency was then rapidly decreased after 84 h and reached 35% of its initial efficiency in 108 h. The enhanced stability of perovskite films prepared by MASP can be ascribed to the incorporation of FA +
and Br -
components which are beneficial for improving the perovskite stability 31 , as the unsealed CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
perovskite solar cells usually lose 70% of their initial efficiencies within 48 h under continuous illumination in air 49 , 50 . Moreover, it is also highly correlated with the high-quality large perovskite grains produced by MASP which are more resistant to light- and moisture-induced degradation. Our ongoing work on further improving the device stability involves the incorporation of Cs +
in the perovskite composition 51
and the encapsulation of devices to isolate them from moisture and UV light. These results will be reported elsewhere in the future. Figure 5: Device stability under continuous working condition. Stability plots of ( a ) PCE, ( b )

and ( d ) FF as a function of time (left axis). The normalized values are also included for better comparisons (right axis). The device stability was measured under continuous AM1.5G solar illumination in ambient environment without encapsulation. Full size image We also explore the manufacturing of large-area perovskite solar cells by MASP. The large-area device is fabricated with the architecture of FTO/compact-TiO 2 /perovskite/PTAA/Ag and the active-layer area of 1.00±0.02 cm 2 . A showdow mask with the aperture area of 0.980 cm 2
is used to measure the
J – V
curves. The highest PCE of 18.02% in a backward scanning was obtained ( Supplementary Fig. 23 ). The hysteresis phenomenon was obvious compared to the standard-area devices (that is, photoactive area=0.10 cm 2 ). However, it is notable that the MASP process is more complicated for depositing large-area perovskite films, as the crystallization rate tends to change and become unstable at the late printing stage. Such instability is likely to be caued by the change of the mensicus shape during the MASP process as the perovskite ink is consumed. Thus, the MASP apparatus will need to be modified to enable a continuous supply of perovksite ink for maintaining the meniscus shape for large-area printing. Moreover, the deposition of uniform electron-transport layer and hole-trasnport layer by MASP over large areas is also important in further improving the device efficiency. In summary, we develop a robust and convenient MASP strategy to effectively deposit large-grained dense FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite films with enhanced optoelectronic properties for high-efficiency perovskite solar cells. Central to this strategy is the solvent evaporation-triggered outward convective flow that transported the perovskite solutes to the edge of the meniscus, promoting the formation of solution-printed micrometre-scale perovskite grains with preferred crystal orientations at low temperatures. The insight into the crystal growth kinetics of FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite is revealed through the real-time optical microscopy study, from which a two-stage, namely, quadratical followed by linear growth of perovskite crystallization is identified. High photovoltaic PCEs approaching 20% are achieved in planar FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite solar cells, which can be ascribed to low trap-state density and long carrier lifetimes in large-grained perovskite films crafted by MASP. As the optoelectronic properties of perovskite films are closely related to film quality, the ability of the MASP strategy to yield dense and uniform films may open up new avenues for low-cost production of large-area flexible solution-printed perovskite-based materials and devices. Methods Materials Formamidinium iodide (H 2 N=CHNH 2 I; FAI) and methylammonium bromide (CH 3 NH 3 Br; MABr) were synthesized according to the reported methods 31 , and dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C for 48 h. Lead iodide (PbI 2 , 99.999%), lead bromide (PbBr 2 , 99.999%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, ≥99.9%) and other materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Meniscus-assisted solution printing of perovskite films The perovskite precursor ink was prepared by dissolving FAI, MABr, PbI 2
and PbBr 2
(molar ratio of FAI:MABr:PbI 2 :PbBr 2= 0.85:0.15:2.55:0.45) in DMSO, and stirred at 60 °C for 2 h to form 0.25 M FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
precursor ink. A 20 μl of the ink solution was loaded in a confined geometry composed of two nearly parallel plates (an upper stationary plate of 0.5 cm × 1 cm and a lower movable substrate of 1.5 cm × 2.5 cm; the separation distance between these two plates was 300 μm). The lower flat substrate was mounted on a computer-programed translational stage (Parker Hannifin Corp, Mode MX80LVixBL2b) with a resolution of 100 nm. The lower substrate was heated at
∼ 60 °C on a Linkam Scientific Precision Temperature Controlled Microscope Stage (Linkam TMS 94 LTS 350) to expedite the evaporation of DMSO. The lower flat substrate placed on the translational stage was moved at a speed of 12 μm s −1
in the direction opposite to the receding meniscus. Thus, the evaporative front progressively swept across the entire substrate to print a continuous large-grained perovskite film. Spin coating of perovskite films The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving FAI, MABr, PbI 2
and PbBr 2
(molar ratio of FAI:MABr:PbI 2 :PbBr 2 =0.85:0.15:2.55:0.45) in DMSO. The solution concentration was 1.2 M. The precursor solution was maintained at 90 °C. It was then spin coated on a pre-heated substrate at 1,000 r.p.m. for 5 s and 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s, followed by thermal annealing at 150 °C for 20 min to form the perovskite film. Fabrication of standard planar perovskite solar cells The FTO glass substrate was treated by oxygen plasma for 10 min, followed by spin coating 0.15 M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution at 2,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. The titanium-containing precursor film was dried at 125 °C for 10 min and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. The resulting TiO 2
layer was then immersed in 20 mM TiCl 4
solution at 65 °C for 20 min, followed by sintering at 550 °C for 30 min to produce a compact TiO 2
layer on the FTO glass substrate. FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite film was then deposited on the compact-TiO 2 /FTO substrate by MASP in ambient air at
∼ 30% relative humidity. 2 ml poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine) (PTAA) toluene solution (25 mg ml −1 ) was mixed with 29 μl Li-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI)/acetonitrile (170 mg ml −1 ) and 20 μl 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP). The resulting PTAA solution was spin coated on the perovskite layer at 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. Finally, a 200-nm silver layer was thermally evaporated on the PTAA layer. Fabrication of inverted planar perovskite solar cells 10 mg ml −1
PTAA toluene solution containing the additives of Li-TFSI and TBP was spin coated on the FTO glass substrate at 2,000 r.p.m. for 60 s, followed by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 5 min. FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite film was then deposited on the PTAA/FTO substrate by MASP. 50 mg ml −1
[6,6]-Phenyl C 61
butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution was spin coated on the perovskite layer at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s, followed by storing in a covered Petri dish for 6 h. Finally, a 5-nm bathocuproine (BCP) layer and a 200-nm silver layer were sequentially deposited by thermal evaporation. Fabrication of space charge limited current devices The FTO glass substrate was treated by oxygen plasma for 10 min, followed by thermally depositing a 500-nm indium layer. FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite film was deposited on the indium/FTO substrate by MASP. Another 500-nm indium layer was then thermally deposited on the perovskite layer. Fabrication of reference devices For comparison, all reference devices (that is, standard and inverted planar perovskite solar cells) were fabricated in similar ways, except that the perovskite films were prepared by spin coating. Characterizations The film morphology and elemental mapping of perovskite films were characterized using a LEO 1550 scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) was performed on a JEOL 100CX transmission electron microscopy (TEM). X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles were collected by a PANalytical X’Pert PRO X-ray diffractometer using Cu K α 1
radiation ( λ =1.541 Å) operating at 40 kV and 40 mA. UV-Vis spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu UV2600 spectrophotometer with a photometric integrating sphere. Fluorescence spectra were recorded using a PerkinElmer LS 45 Fluorescence Spectrometer. The
in situ
optical microscopy studies were conducted using a Leica DFC450 C digital microscope camera equipped with a 5 Megapixel CCD sensor. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements were performed using a Photon Technology International (PTI) LaserStrobe spectrofluorometer equipped with a PTI GL-3300 nanosecond nitrogen laser ( λ =337 nm) operating at 11 Hz. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured by Thermo K-Alpha XPS system. Perovskite solar cells were tested under AM1.5G irradiation using a Newport LCS-100 Solar Simulator (100 mW cm −2 , calibrated with a Newport 91150V Reference Cell System). The current density–voltage ( J – V ) curves were measured using a Keithley 2601A multisource meter. No preconditioning protocol was used before the characterization. The
J – V
curves were measured in air (that is, temperature: 25±2 °C, relative humidity: 30±8 %) without encapsulation. The
J – V
curves were scanned in the forward direction unless specified, and were processed at the rate of 50 mV s −1
with a sweep delay time of 50 ms. For standard-area solar cells, the active-layer area was 0.10±0.02 cm 2 , and a shadow mask with an aperture area of 0.096 cm 2
was used to define the measured area. For large-area solar cells, the active-layer area was 1.00±0.02 cm 2
and the aperture area of the shadow mask was 0.980 cm 2 . The device stability with the active-layer area of 0.10±0.02 cm 2
and the aperture area of 0.096 cm 2
was measured under continuous AM1.5G solar illumination in ambient environment (that is, temperature=25±2 °C and relative humidity=30±8%) without encapsulation. The photovoltaic efficiency was measured in an interval of 12 h. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement was performed using a Newport Quantum Efficiency Measurement Kit.

Abstract
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites with mixed organic cations and/or halides have attracted increasing attention due to their superior optoelectronic properties, which are tailorable for different applications. To obtain a deeper understanding of materials properties, single crystals are regarded as the best platform among various building blocks for fundamental study. Here, we synthesized a series of perovskite single crystals with mixed organic cations (APbI 3 , A = CH 3 NH 3 + , MA + ; or CH(NH 2 ) 2 + , FA + ) along the compositional space, and conducted a systematic investigation to correlate the carrier behavior with the organic cations. The single crystals were synthesized
via
inverse temperature crystallization assisted by hydroiodic acid, where the quality of the crystals could be judiciously controlled by the thermodynamic process. It is found that the substitution of 15% MA +
in FAPbI 3
single crystals stabilizes the phase with the best charge transport characteristics. Both photodetector and
J – V
measurements suggested that FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 3
single crystal exhibits suppressed ion migration compared with the counterpart FA 0.15 MA 0.85 PbI 3
single crystal. These results represent an important step to highlight the role of organic cations in hybrid perovskite materials, which will further benefit fundamental understanding of materials and device optimization.

Book description
This book covers the physical side of colloidal science from the individual forces acting between particles smaller than a micrometer that are suspended in a liquid, through the resulting equilibrium and dynamic properties. A variety of internal forces both attractive and repulsive act in conjunction with Brownian motion and the balance between them all decides the phase behaviour. On top of this various external fields, such as gravity or electromagnetic fields, diffusion and non-Newtonian rheology produce complex effects, each of which is of important scientific and technological interest. The authors aim to impart a sound, quantitative understanding based on fundamental theory and experiments with well-characterised model systems. This broad grasp of the fundamentals lends insight and helps to develop the intuitive sense needed to isolate essential features of the technological problems and design critical experiments. The main prerequisites for understanding the book are basic fluid mechanics, statistical mechanics and electromagnetism, though self contained reviews of each subject are provided at appropriate points. Some facility with differential equations is also necessary. Exercises are included at the end of each chapter, making the work suitable as a textbook for graduate courses in chemical engineering or applied mathematics. It will also be useful as a reference for individuals in academia or industry undertaking research in colloid science.
Reviews
‘Many readers, in particular theoreticians, will find it quite useful in developing a clear understanding of the advanced theory of colloidal systems and how it is related to experiment…[an] excellent but advanced book.’
Source: Journal of Non-Newtonian Fluid Mechanics
‘Colloidal Dispersions clearly sets a high standard for the teaching and understanding of colloid science in terms of relating microstructure to macroscopic behavior.
There is no question that it is a necessary reference for anyone seriously interested in colloid science.’

GaP tensile strain compensation (SC) layers were introduced into GaAs solar cells enhanced with a five layer stack of InAs quantum dots (QDs). One sun air mass zero illuminated current-voltage curves show that SC results in improved conversion efficiency and reduced dark current. The strain compensated QD solar cell shows a slight increase in short circuit current compared to a baseline GaAs cell due to sub-GaAs bandgap absorption by the InAs QD. Quantum efficiency and electroluminescence were also measured and provide further insight to the improvements due to SC.

It has been predicted that solar cell efficiency can be improved through the incorporation of low dimensional nanostructured materials. 1,2
One approach involves the insertion of quantum dots (QDs) into standard single junction solar cells in an attempt to form an isolated intermediate band (IB) within the bandgap of the host. 3,4
Initial theoretical predictions for conversion efficiency of the IB design are near 63%. 1,5
Recently, there have been numerous experimental demonstrations of the key operating principles of the IB solar cell using both InAs (Refs.
6 and 7 ) and GaSb (Ref.
8 ) QDs in a GaAs host. A complementary approach to the IB design takes advantage of the extended absorption spectrum of the lower bandgap heterostructures (QDs) inserted into the current limiting junction of a multijunction solar cell. 9
In this approach, the extended absorption spectrum of the nanostructures allows for an enhancement of the overall short circuit current and a global efficiency improvement of the triple junction cell. The theoretical modeling of an
In Ga P ∕ Ga As ∕ Ge
triple junction cell, in which QDs are used to extend the middle junction absorption spectrum, indicated that the efficiency could be improved to 47% under 1 sun AM0 illumination. 9
These devices may also have additional benefits such as enhanced radiation tolerance. 10
In this paper, the effect of incorporating InAs QDs and GaP strain compensation (SC) layers within the
i
region of a
p - i - n
GaAs solar cell has been investigated. As the InAs QDs are grown using the Stranski–Kranstanow technique, residual compressive strain will accumulate as successive dot layers are grown. As has been done for QD laser diodes 11,12
and multi-quantum-well (multi-QW) well solar cells, 13
a layer of material under tensile strain (e.g., GaP) can be grown to offset compressive strain, leading to an overall strain neutral QD or QW stack. Prior work was done by inserting the QDs into the
i
region of the GaAs solar cell without SC. 14
These cells did show an increase in the sub-GaAs bandgap spectral response but the added strain from the QDs resulted in cell efficiency degradation. Recent work by Marti
et al. 15
has also shown that strain induced dislocations in the cell emitter originate in the uncompensated quantum dot stacks.
For this study, GaAs-based solar cells containing five-layer InAs QD arrays, both with and without GaP SC layers, were grown using a multiwafer rotating disk metal organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) system. Growth conditions and optical properties of these QDs have been previously reported. 16
The QD size
( height × diameter )
and density were determined to be
7 × 40 nm 2
and
5 ( ± 0.5 ) × 10 10 cm − 2 ⁠ , respectively.
GaAs based
p - i - n
solar cells were grown both with and without InAs QDs embedded in the
i
region and with and without GaP SC layers between each InAs layer. The design of the baseline
p - i - n
solar cell has been discussed elsewhere. 14
The baseline cells without InAs QDs had a
100 nm
GaAs intrinsic region, while cells with QDs had an array of five layers of undoped InAs QDs grown in the
i
region using the optimized QD growth conditions. The thickness of the GaAs spacer between each dot layer was
10 nm ⁠ . For the strain compensated (SC) QD solar cells, each QD layer was followed by the growth of a
6 nm
GaAs spacer and a
1.4 nm
GaP SC layer. An additional
4 nm
GaAs spacer was then grown in preparation for the next QD layer. Figure
1
shows a simplified band diagram generated using physics-based modeling software ( SILVACO ATLAS ). This diagram illustrates the layer structure in the
i
region of the strain compensated QD solar cell.

( J sc ) ⁠ , efficiency, and fill factor (FF) for the three cells in this study. The baseline cell gave results at or near the standard values for GaAs solar cells, confirming the GaAs cell design and material quality from our MOVPE process. 17
The addition of the uncompensated QD array results in a substantial decrease in overall cell performance. Degradation in both
J sc
and
V oc
are likely due to increased minority carrier recombination. The reduced FF results from a decrease in majority carrier mobility in the emitter region. 18
Mobility degradation has been shown to be related to misfit dislocations which may originate at the QD layer and thread to the surface, thereby creating scattering centers within the emitter region. 15

Inclusion of SC layers had a profound effect on the illuminated AM0
J V
characteristics of the QD device (Fig.
2 ). The open circuit voltage improved to
0.83 V
and the short circuit current also improved to the extent that there was a slight increase compared to the baseline device. The increased
J sc
of the device resulted from an improved lifetime in the emitter region 11
and from the photogenerated current contributed by the QDs. The increase in
V oc
can be related to a reduction in recombination current through the dependence of open circuit voltage on both
J sc
and saturation current
( J 0 ) ⁠ . The improvement in FF can be attributed to improved carrier transport through the intrinsic and emitter regions.
Measurements of the diodes under dark conditions allowed for the saturation current and ideality parameters to be extracted (see Table
I ), thereby providing an alternative method for verifying the reduction in recombination current. The baseline cell gave a low
J 0
and diode ideality
( n )
of 1.48. This behavior is typical for GaAs
p - i - n
diodes of this size and indicates that the cell is of good quality but deviates from ideal conditions
( n = 1 )
due to surface and/or perimeter recombination. 19
The uncompensated QD enhanced solar cell shows both an increase in
J 0
and an ideality greater than 2. This is an evidence of the increase in the recombination in the depletion region and nonideal diode behavior due to dislocations in the emitter region. The use of SC results in reduced
J 0
and an ideality much closer to the baseline value. This was a clear indication that SC results in a reduction of the recombination driven current.
Measurements of the cell quantum efficiency (QE) also show the advantage to the inclusion of the SC layers. QE measures the number of electrons or holes collected as photocurrent per incident photon of light at a particular wavelength. As seen in Fig.
3(a) , the QE for a standard GaAs cell will rapidly fall off at the GaAs band edge near
870 nm
(photons with energy below the bandgap produce no photocurrent in the cell). However, the five-layer QD cells show an extended QE spectrum at wavelengths below
870 nm ⁠ . The QD cells show
∼ 2 %
QE in the
870 – 950 nm
range. This indicates that a portion of the short circuit current is being generated from below the host bandgap.

Although both QD cells show enhanced QE below the GaAs bandgap, the effect of adding uncompensated dots to the cell structure reduced the QE above the host bandgap. The QE for the strain compensated QD cell did not show any degradation in the above GaAs bandgap spectral range. The sub-GaAs bandgap QE was also slightly increased over the five-layer uncompensated cell. This further evidenced that the SC layers both improve emitter material quality (above GaAs bandgap QE recovery) and improve the QD quality (increased sub-GaAs bandgap QE).
In addition, the room-temperature electroluminescence (EL) spectra of the SC-QD device [Fig.
3(b) ] was compared to its spectral response. As can be seen in the EL spectra, carrier injection into the
i
region leads to multiple peaks (labeled as 1, 2, and 3 in the figure), each of which corresponds to peaks in the cell QE curve. Based on earlier measurements of PL test structures containing our QDs, peak 3 corresponds to the ground state energy transition. 16
The peaks at 1 and 2 are due either to transitions involving the higher energy bound states in the QDs or transitions within the thin InAs wetting layer QW. 4
The correspondence of EL and QE is further evidence of light absorption and subsequent carrier collection occurring in the InAs superlattice. Similar measurements of the uncompensated QD cell failed to give any detectable EL signal.
Extraction of short circuit current from integration of the spectral response with the standard AM0 spectrum was done for both the baseline and SC-QD enhanced solar cells. The SC-QD cell result gave a small net increase in short circuit current of
∼ 0.1 mA ∕ cm 2
over the baseline cell. Although this increase in
J sc
is modest, the result is highly encouraging. The QD contribution to short circuit current is expected to increase though additional layers of QDs.
In conclusion, we have grown GaAs based
p - i - n
solar cells with and without InAs QDs and with and without a GaP SC scheme. Our results under simulated 1 sun AM0 conditions have demonstrated the effectiveness of SC layers for improving the performance of QD solar cells. A five-layer SC-QD device was grown which had increased
J sc
and QE as compared to a baseline device. Comparisons of EL and spectral response for the SC-QD cell showed a clear sub-GaAs bandgap spectral response and confirmed QD absorption and subsequent carrier collection. The SC-QD cell results show the possibility of using this type of cell to current match the full
In Ga P ∕ Ga As ∕ Ge
triple junction solar cell.

Abstract :
Magnetite particles deposited on the secondary side of a steam generator (SG) can degrade the integrity and performance of pressurized water reactors. Therefore, it is necessary to produce the data of fundamental interfacial electrokinetic properties of magnetite particles and SG tube materials. This study investigated the zeta potentials of magnetite nanoparticles and Alloy 690 surfaces, which were dependent on the pH value, pH agent, and the presence of NaCl. The zeta potentials of the magnetite nanoparticles increased in the negative direction as the pH increased, regardless of the pH agent. At the same pH value, the absolute values of the zeta potentials with different pH agents were: ethanolamine < ammonia < morpholine. In the presence of NaCl, the zeta potentials of the particles further increased negatively. The meaning of the measured zeta potentials was discussed in terms of the dispersion stability and the agglomeration of the particles. Based on the relationship between the zeta potentials of the particles and Alloy 690 surfaces, the magnetite deposition on Alloy 690 was also discussed. Furthermore, the empirical formulas for the pH-dependent zeta potentials of magnetite particles in each alkaline solution were suggested.

1. Introduction Corrosion products of carbon steel and other structural materials in pressurized water reactors (PWRs) are released to the secondary water as a result of flow-accelerated corrosion [ 1 , 2 ]. These corrosion product particles are transported to steam generators (SGs) and attached to SG tubes to form deposits with a porous structure. The majority of these deposits are composed of magnetite [ 3 ]. These magnetite deposits reduce the heat transfer efficiency, hinder the normal water flow, accelerate the corrosion of the SG tube materials owing to the galvanic effect, and even act as a site where aggressive impurities can accumulate [ 4 , 5 , 6 ]. Therefore, mitigating and inhibiting such magnetite deposition is a key to controlling the chemistry of secondary water for reliable PWR operation. To achieve this goal, it is essential to produce fundamental dispersion property data of magnetite particles suspended in secondary water. The degree of dispersion stability of colloidal particles in an aqueous solution can be evaluated by determining the zeta potential, which is the principal electrokinetic property of the particles and governs their agglomeration, dispersion, and deposition on metal surfaces [ 7 , 8 ]. The degree of zeta potential is typically measured in mV and determines the degree of electrostatic repulsion between adjacent particles. For example, as the zeta potential approaches zero, the particles tend to agglomerate; however, the repulsive force of each particle increases as the zeta potential increases, thereby increasing the dispersion stability in the solution. On the other hand, like particles in suspension, any metal surface in an aqueous environment can acquire a zeta potential. Accordingly, the metal surface can interact with the adjacent charged particles. Recent studies have demonstrated that the number of particles deposited on a metal surface is strongly affected by the difference in the zeta potentials of the particles and metal surfaces [ 9 , 10 ]. Therefore, comparing the zeta potentials of magnetite particles and SG tube materials could prove useful for studying magnetite deposition behavior in the secondary side of SGs. The secondary side of PWRs is managed by a thorough pH control to suppress the corrosion of the structural materials of the secondary system. In general, the pH has been controlled to approximately 9.0–10.0 with ammonia, morpholine, or ethanolamine (ETA), which are the most widely used pH control agents. Although the zeta potential data of magnetite particles in the PWRs are critical, numerous previous studies have only reported the zeta potentials of magnetite particles in alkaline solutions using NaOH or KOH, which are not used in the nuclear industry. In addition, NaCl, which can be introduced to secondary water by condenser in-leakage, can cause stress corrosion cracking or pitting corrosion of SG tubes [ 11 , 12 ]; therefore, its concentration has been strictly regulated less than 5 ppb for Na and 10 ppb for Cl, based on the water chemistry guideline values during SG operation [ 13 , 14 ]. However, few studies have been conducted on how NaCl affects the zeta potential of magnetite particles in nuclear water chemistry. Furthermore, a literature survey showed that there have been few studies on the surface zeta potential of SG tube materials in secondary water. Thus, in this study, when the pH was controlled with ammonia, morpholine, or ETA, the pH-dependent zeta potentials of magnetite nanoparticles were measured and compared. The effect of the addition of NaCl on the zeta potential of magnetite nanoparticles was also investigated. Accordingly, the meaning of the measured zeta potentials was qualitatively discussed in terms of the dispersion stability and the agglomeration of the particles. Additionally, the surface zeta potentials of Ni-based thermally treated Alloy 690 were measured, which is the primary SG tube material used in PWRs because of its excellent corrosion resistance. Subsequently, the magnetite deposition on Alloy 690 was discussed by comparing the measured zeta potentials of magnetite particles and Alloy 690 surfaces.
2. Experimental
2.1. Zeta Potential Measurement Figure 1
shows a schematic of the zeta potential measurement using a Zetasizer (Nano ZS90) equipped with an automatic pH-titrator (MPT-2) (Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Worcestershire, UK). Initially, we prepared a sample solution by dispersing magnetite nanoparticles in deionized water at a concentration of 25 mg/L. The magnetite nanoparticles were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA), whose size ranged from 4 nm to 6 nm with an average of 5 nm. Additionally, a diluted alkaline solution of ammonia, morpholine, or ETA was prepared. The basic properties of these three pH agents used in this study are presented in
Table 1 . Subsequently, the alkaline solution was injected into the sample solution using a programmable micrometering pump, and the pH of the sample was titrated in real-time. Afterwards, when the pH reached the target value, the sample was automatically transferred to the zeta potential measurement cell. After the stabilization time, the electric field was applied through an electrode pair mounted on both sides of the cell. The charged magnetite particles were then attracted toward the oppositely charged electrode with a velocity proportional to the field strength and charge. The electrophoretic mobility of the particles was measured by the electrophoretic light scattering (ELS) technique that is known as the most suitable method for determining the zeta potential of particles fine enough to stay suspended in a solution [ 7 ]. The measured mobility was then converted to the zeta potential (

value was set to 1. The refractive index and absorption of the magnetite particles were set to 2.420 and 0.01, respectively. The principle for measuring the zeta potential is presented in detail [ 16 ]. After the measurement was finished, the solution in the cell was automatically transferred back to the sample container. The zeta potential measurements were automatically repeated from the second step by increasing the pH value from 9.0 to 10.0. No acid solution was used during the test. The magnetite nanoparticles remained thermodynamically stable during the zeta potential measurements in this study. Furthermore, to compare the zeta potential of magnetite nanoparticles with and without the addition of NaCl, we prepared an additional sample solution by dispersing the magnetite nanoparticles with an average size of 5 nm in deionized water at a concentration of 25 mg/L. High-purity NaCl (99.99%) was added to the solution at a concentration of 6.6 mg/L. The pH of the solution was automatically titrated from 9.0 to 10.0 with diluted ETA. The test procedure was the same as that described above, and all observations were carried out at 25 °C.
2.2. Surface Zeta Potential Measurement Particles in the suspension become charged and move under electrophoresis upon application of the electric field. Using these suspended particles as tracers, the surface zeta potential of metal can be estimated by measuring the electrophoretic mobility of the particles located at multiple distances from the metal surface. Figure 2
shows a schematic of the surface zeta potential measurement kit. Initially, we prepared rectangular samples of Alloy 690, which were not larger than 5 mm (length) × 4 mm (width) × 1 mm (thickness). To minimize the effect of surface conditions on the zeta potential [ 10 ], the sample surfaces were carefully ground to obtain a similar roughness. The sample was then attached to a sample holder and immersed in a solution in a cuvette, as shown in
Figure 2 . The solution was the same as that used to measure the zeta potential of magnetite nanoparticles as described in
Section 2.1 , and the pH was either 9.0 or 10.0. When an electric field is applied through a pair of Pd electrodes, the electrophoresis of tracer particles begins. We measured the apparent tracer electrophoretic mobility at four different distances from the sample surface by rotating a screw for adjusting the sample height. The surface zeta potential of Alloy 690 was then derived by the linear extrapolation method. All data were obtained at 25 °C; additional details have been described elsewhere [ 17 ]. Furthermore, surface zeta potential measurements using Alloy 690 were conducted to compare the results obtained with and without the addition of NaCl. The concentrations of magnetite particles and NaCl in the solution were the same as those of the solution used to measure the zeta potential, as described in
Section 2.1 . The pH was maintained at 9.5, with diluted ETA. The test procedure was the same as that mentioned above.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Effect of pH Control Agents Figure 3
shows the zeta potentials of magnetite nanoparticles as a function of pH value that is controlled with the addition of ETA, ammonia, or morpholine at 25 °C. According to previous studies, the zeta potential is dependent on the solution pH, and the relationship between zeta potential and pH is empirically expressed as [ 18 , 19 ]:
ζ
=
k
IEP
−
pH
(3)
where
k
is a constant, and IEP is the isoelectric point, i.e., the pH value at which the zeta potential is equal to zero. In general, the zeta potential decreases as the pH increases. A decrease in the negative zeta potential to a more negative value implies greater repulsion to a negatively charged surface or particle [ 19 ]. The solid lines in
Figure 3
show the linear regression fits of the measured zeta potentials in the solution of each pH agent based on Equation (3). The pH-dependent zeta potentials of magnetite nanoparticles at 25 °C can be expressed by the following empirical equations:

are for the solutions of ETA, ammonia, and morpholine, respectively. These equations are valid at pH values ranging from 9.0 to 10.0. In the future, if these equations are further upgraded by reflecting the effects of variables such as temperature, particle size, and shape, it is expected to be used in various ways as basic interfacial properties of magnetite particles suspended in secondary water. As shown in
Figure 3 , the magnetite nanoparticles were negatively charged under all conditions. Regardless of the pH agent, when the pH value increased from 9.0 to 10.0, the zeta potentials of the particles increased in the negative direction, which seems because the activity of hydroxyl groups (
OH
−
) increases with increasing pH value. This result implies that as the pH increases, the repulsive force between the particles increases, leading to an increase in dispersion stability and a decrease in the agglomeration. In addition, the zeta potential of the particles varied depending on the pH agent. At the same pH value, the absolute value of the zeta potential was the lowest when using ETA and the highest when using morpholine. According to a previous investigation [ 20 ], the electrical conductance of the magnetite column in the solutions increased in the order: ETA < ammonia < morpholine. This result implies that electrical properties of the particles vary depending on which solutions the particles are dispersed in; therefore, it is thought that the zeta potential of the particles appears to be high in the morpholine solution because the electrical conductance of the particles increases. Unfortunately, exactly what mechanism causes the zeta potential to be different depending on pH agent was not found in the literature. In fact, there are few studies comparable to our results with the exception of one previous investigation by Essi et al. [ 21 ]. They reported that the zeta potentials of magnetite were approximately −16 mV, −25 mV, and −36 mV when the pH was controlled at 9.2 with ETA, ammonia, and morpholine, respectively [ 21 ]. According to our results using Equation (4), the zeta potentials were calculated to be −25.3 mV, −32.0 mV, and −35.4 mV when the pH was 9.2 for the solutions of ETA, ammonia, and morpholine, respectively. The results for morpholine were almost similar, but the results for ETA and ammonia were evaluated to be greater in absolute values than those in the literature [ 21 ]. These differences may be caused by that the zeta potentials were measured by the streaming potential technique with a magnetite column made of 500 nm-sized magnetite powders in the previous study, whereas the zeta potentials were measured by the ELS technique with 5 nm-sized magnetite nanoparticles dispersed in the solutions in this study. On the other hand, based on the zeta potential results in this study, it is expected that the size of the magnetite particles should be the largest in the case of ETA, followed by ammonia and morpholine. This is because the lower the absolute value of zeta potential, the greater the tendency of particles to agglomerate. Figure 4
shows the relationship between the zeta potentials of magnetite nanoparticles and Alloy 690 surfaces at pH values of 9.0 and 10.0, depending on the pH agent, at 25 °C. For all cases, the magnetite nanoparticles and Alloy 690 surfaces were negatively charged, thereby indicating that a repulsive force exists between them. As shown in
Figure 4 , the differences in the zeta potentials between the magnetite nanoparticles and Alloy 690 surfaces (∆ZP) could be calculated. When the pH increased from 9.0 to 10.0, ∆ZP increased regardless of the pH agent. Furthermore, ∆ZP indicates the electrostatic repulsive force between the particles and Alloy 690 surfaces; hence, the greater the ∆ZP, the more is the energy required to attach the particles to the surfaces. Accordingly, it is expected that the amount of magnetite deposition on the Alloy 690 surfaces will decrease as the pH increases from 9.0 to 10.0, regardless of the pH agent. In addition, at the same pH value, ∆ZP was the smallest in the ETA solution and the largest in the ammonia solution. Consequently, it is expected that the number of magnetite deposits will be the highest in ETA and the lowest in ammonia solution. However, the deposition behavior on the hot surface of operating SG tubes may not be fully explained by our results because the zeta potentials in this study were all measured at 25 °C. Nevertheless, considerable recent efforts have been made to improve this approach for a reliable description of the deposition behavior, along with the zeta potential measurement [ 9 , 10 ].
3.2. Effect of NaCl Addition Figure 5
shows the effect of the addition of NaCl on the zeta potential of magnetite nanoparticles in solutions with pH values adjusted with ETA at 25 °C. As shown in the figure, even when NaCl was added, the magnetite particles were negatively charged, and the zeta potential increased further in the negative direction. Moreover, the zeta potential of the magnetite nanoparticles increased negatively as the pH increased from 9.0 to 10.0. Accordingly, the addition of NaCl increases the repulsive forces between the colloidal magnetite particles, thereby increasing the dispersion stability. Therefore, it is also expected that the agglomeration of the particles will be suppressed, which is also supported by the previous experimental results where the size of synthesized magnetite nanoparticles was found to decrease with increasing NaCl concentration [ 22 ]. Figure 6
shows the relationship between the zeta potential of magnetite nanoparticles and the Alloy 690 surfaces at a pH of 9.5 controlled with ETA at 25 °C. The particles and surfaces were all negatively charged and the zeta potentials increased in the negative direction with the addition of NaCl. As shown in the figure, ∆ZP was calculated to be 5.1 mV and 15.9 mV without and with NaCl addition, respectively. These results indicate that the repulsive force between the particles and Alloy 690 surfaces increases with the addition of NaCl. Therefore, it is predicted that the deposition of magnetite particles on Alloy 690 surfaces requires more energy, leading to a decrease in the number of magnetite deposits owing to the presence of NaCl.
4. Conclusions The zeta potentials of magnetite nanoparticles and Alloy 690 surfaces were measured at 25 °C. Based on the experimental results, the following conclusions were drawn:
The empirical formulas for the zeta potentials of magnetite nanoparticles derived in the pH range from 9.0 to 10.0 at 25 °C were as follows:

for morpholine. The zeta potentials of the magnetite nanoparticles increased in the negative direction as the pH increased from 9.0 to 10.0, regardless of the pH agent. This result indicates that as the pH increases, the repulsive force between the particles increases, thereby leading to an increase in the dispersion stability. At the same pH value, the absolute value of the zeta potential increased in the order: ETA < ammonia < morpholine, meaning that the dispersion stability of the particles also increases in the same order. The difference in the zeta potentials between the magnetite nanoparticles and Alloy 690 surfaces increased with increasing pH from 9.0 to 10.0, regardless of the pH agent. At the same pH value, the difference was the largest in ammonia. From these results, it is expected that the amount of magnetite deposited on the Alloy 690 surfaces will decrease as the pH increases from 9.0 to 10.0, and will be the smallest in the ammonia. The zeta potentials of magnetite nanoparticles increased in the negative direction by the addition of NaCl. In addition, the difference in the zeta potentials between the magnetite nanoparticles and Alloy 690 surfaces increased by approximately three times by the addition of NaCl. These results suggest that NaCl plays a role in increasing the repulsive force between the particles and Alloy 690 surfaces.

Abstract Solar cells based on metal halide perovskites are one of the most promising photovoltaic technologies 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . Over the past few years, the long-term operational stability of such devices has been greatly improved by tuning the composition of the perovskites 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , optimizing the interfaces within the device structures 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , and using new encapsulation techniques 14 , 15 . However, further improvements are required in order to deliver a longer-lasting technology. Ion migration in the perovskite active layer—especially under illumination and heat—is arguably the most difficult aspect to mitigate 16 , 17 , 18 . Here we incorporate ionic liquids into the perovskite film and thence into positive–intrinsic–negative photovoltaic devices, increasing the device efficiency and markedly improving the long-term device stability. Specifically, we observe a degradation in performance of only around five per cent for the most stable encapsulated device under continuous simulated full-spectrum sunlight for more than 1,800 hours at 70 to 75 degrees Celsius, and estimate that the time required for the device to drop to eighty per cent of its peak performance is about 5,200 hours. Our demonstration of long-term operational, stable solar cells under intense conditions is a key step towards a reliable perovskite photovoltaic technology.

Main Ionic liquids have previously been incorporated into negative–intrinsic–positive perovskite solar cells (in which the perovskite light-absorbing layer is deposited directly on top of the
n -type (electron-dominated) charge-extraction layer, rather than on the
p -type (hole-dominated) charge-extraction layer as in a positive–intrinsic–negative cell), resulting in improved device performance 19 , 20 . The mechanism driving the improvement has been ascribed to the formation of halide complexes 20 , or to an advantageous energy-level alignment at the
n -type interface between the charge-extraction layer and the perovskite 19 . Here we incorporate an ionic-liquid-containing triple-cation perovskite absorber of (FA 0.83 MA 0.17 ) 0.95 Cs 0.05 Pb(I 0.9 Br 0.1 ) 3
(ref.
5 )—where FA is formamidinium and MA is methylammonium—into positive–intrinsic–negative planar solar cells, using nickel oxide (NiO) and [6,6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as, respectively, the
p -type and
n -type charge-extraction layers (Fig.
1a ). Fig. 1: Device architecture and characterization. a , Architecture of our planar heterojunction positive–intrinsic–negative perovskite solar cell.
b , Chemical structure of the ionic liquid BMIMBF 4 .
c – f , Characteristics of control devices (navy circles) and devices comprising an optimal amount of BMIMBF 4
(0.3 mol%; red squares).
c , Current density–voltage ( J – V)
curves of the best performing device for each condition measured from forward bias (FB) to short-circuit (SC) scan and back again under simulated AM1.5 sunlight. The light intensities used to measure the control device and the BMIMBF 4 -containing device were 102 mW cm −2
and 105 mW cm −2 , respectively.
d , Histograms showing the device efficiencies (power conversion efficiency, PCE) of 50 cells per type, fitted with Gaussian distributions (solid lines).
e , External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (data points) and integrated photocurrent (solid lines), integrated over the AM1.5 (100 mW cm −2 ) solar spectrum. The integrated
J SC
values over the entire EQE spectra were 22.3 mA cm −2
and 22.8 mA cm −2
for the control and the BMIMBF 4 -containing device, respectively.
f , Current density and steady-state power output (SPO), measured for 100 s at a fixed voltage near the maximum power point (MPP) identified in the
J – V
curves. Dashed ovals with arrows pointing left and right represent measured SPO and current-density values, respectively. Full size image We add 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMIMBF 4 ; Fig.
1b ) to the perovskite precursor, and observe enhanced efficiencies in complete photovoltaic cells comprising 0.15–0.9 mol% of BMIMBF 4
with respect to the lead atoms (Extended Data Fig.
1a–e ). We notice an improved performance due to initial light soaking during the current–voltage
(J – V)
measurements, which we elaborate upon in Extended Data Fig.
1e, f . We measure the steady-state power output (SPO) of the top one or top two best performing devices of each substrate for 50–100 seconds at a fixed voltage near the maximum power point (MPP) obtained from the peak
J – V
curves. For our ‘champion’ device, comprising 0.3 mol% BMIMBF 4 , we measure an open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 1.08 V, a short-circuit current ( J SC ) of 23.8 mA cm −2
and a high fill factor of 0.81, yielding a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.8% (Fig.
1c
and Extended Data Table
1 ; measurement is made under a light intensity of 105 mW cm −2 ). The champion control device exhibits a PCE of 18.5%, owing to a lower
V OC
of 1.02 V and fill factor of 0.79. We provide histograms of the PCEs for controls and for devices with 0.3 mol% BMIMBF 4
in Fig.
1d . We verify that
J SC
values derived from the
J – V
curves are well matched with the external quantum efficiency (EQE) results, integrated over the solar spectrum (Fig.
1e ). We note that, with careful optimization, we can obtain devices with little
J – V
hysteresis (Extended Data Fig.
1h ), but there is nevertheless some hysteresis; however, we measure SPOs of 18.7% and 20.0% for the champion control device and the device with optimal BMIMBF 4 , respectively (Fig.
1f ). We observe increased hysteresis in BMIMBF 4 -containing devices with increasingly higher concentrations of BMIMBF 4
in the perovskite film. A pronounced hysteresis and an abnormal ‘overshoot’ close to the MPP in the
J – V
curve appear when 1.2 mol% BMIMBF 4
is incorporated into the perovskite active layer (Extended Data Fig.
1i ). In order to understand why adding a low concentration of BMIMBF 4
improves the device performance, we carry out a range of film characterizations. With the addition of BMIMBF 4 , the X-ray diffraction (XRD) peak positions remain unaltered, consistent with neither [BMIM] +
nor [BF 4 ] −
incorporating into and perturbing the perovskite crystal lattice (Extended Data Fig.
2a ). However, a slightly increased intensity of the main diffraction peaks occurs, suggesting enhanced texturing or crystallinity, in good agreement with the slightly enlarged grains seen in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Extended Data Fig.
2b ). We find a negligible change in the film absorption, but an increased photoluminescence intensity and extended photoluminescence lifetime for the BMIMBF 4 -containing perovskite film (Extended Data Fig.
2c, d ), consistent with reduced defects in the film. We carry out ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to investigate the surface electronic properties of the perovskite films. From the UPS spectra, we observe a 320 meV decrease in the work function of the perovskite film—from 5.13 eV to 4.81 eV—with respect to vacuum after addition of BMIMBF 4
(Extended Data Fig.
2e ). There is no change in the relative Fermi level position with respect to the valance-band offset, indicating that the energy levels of the perovskite absorber, when processed with BMIMBF 4 , move closer to vacuum. The change in the energy-level structure could result from a shift in the relative energy alignment of the buried heterojunction between the perovskite and the NiO hole-extraction layer, or from a shift in energy-level alignment at the topmost perovskite surface, which in a complete device would subsequently contact the PCBM electron-extraction layer. In light of the increased
V OC
and fill factor in the cells, this resulting energetic shift is most likely leading to an improved energetic alignment, with smaller voltage losses at one or both of the heterojunctions, and improved charge extraction 21 . From XPS spectra of the BMIMBF 4 -containing perovskite film (Fig.
2a ), we detect the nitrogen of BMIM at 402.3 eV but no fluorine from BF 4
at 686.2 eV on the top surface. We note that the signal strength for the fluorine 1 s
orbital is usually stronger than that of the nitrogen 1 s
orbital; thus our results suggest that there is a predominant presence of BMIM at the top surface. This is also consistent with the energetic shifts being due to the organic cation modifying the surface dipole of the perovskite film. Fig. 2: Compositional distribution of BMIMBF 4

d , Photoluminescence images of control film and BMIMBF 4 -containing film under a constant applied bias (10 V). The bright areas represent photoluminescence emission from the perovskite films. The BMIMBF 4
concentration in the BMIMBF 4 -containing perovskite films is 0.3 mol% with respect to the lead atoms. Full size image We perform time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) to probe the chemical composition throughout the film, and we present the signals from both negative and positive secondary ions. In the BMIMBF 4 -containing perovskite film, the BF 4
is located mainly at the buried interface (Fig.
2b ), while the BMIM exists throughout the bulk film, as well as accumulating at the buried interface (Fig.
2c ). This suggests that there is an accumulation of ion pairs of BMIM and BF 4
at the perovskite/NiO interface. We note that if we substitute the NiO with an organic hole-conductor, poly[ N , N ′-bis(4-butylphenyl)- N , N ′-bis(phenyl)benzidine] (poly-TPD), we measure decreased efficiencies with obvious hysteresis and the emergence of an overshoot in the
J – V
curve from devices with 0.3 mol% BMIMBF 4
(Extended Data Fig.
3 ). This indicates that the mechanism driving the enhanced device performance in our NiO-based cells is related to the improved interaction between perovskite and NiO at the interface 22 , facilitated by processing with BMIMBF 4 . We characterize the photoluminescence of perovskite thin films between two in-plane electrodes, with a constant electrical bias applied between the electrodes, to determine whether there are any field- or ion-induced changes in the BMIMBF 4 -containing perovskite films 17 , 23 . In a series of photoluminescence images of the films as a function of time (Fig.
2d ), we observe clear luminescence quenching from the positive towards the negative electrode for the control film. We interpret this to indicate that the photoluminescence is suppressed by ion migration, whereby some regions of the film accumulate a high density of defects, and/or the stoichiometry of the perovskite layer deviates considerably at different positions across the channel between the electrodes 24 . In stark contrast, for the BMIMBF 4 -containing perovskite film, the photoluminescence is close to unchanging throughout the entire measurement time. Unpredictably, our observations indicate that ion migration in the perovskite films is greatly suppressed by introducing BMIMBF 4 . We then investigate the stability of perovskite films under simulated full-spectrum sunlight at 60–65 °C in ambient air. For the control film, we observe an obvious colour change from black to yellow-grey after 72 hours of light soaking; this results from a fractional decomposition to PbI 2 , as we infer from XRD measurements (Fig.
3a ). We expect this to happen because, in the presence of light and oxygen, superoxide is generated, which decomposes MAPbI 3
rapidly to PbI 2
(refs
25 , 26 ). By contrast, we observe no discolouration and negligible PbI 2
in the post-aged BMIMBF 4 -containing perovskite films. Fig. 3: Film stability and the interaction between PbI 2
and BMIM-containing ionic liquids. a , XRD patterns of pristine and aged samples of control film and film containing BMIMBF 4
(0.3 mol%) on NiO/FTO-coated glass substrates. The stars represent the decomposition product of PbI 2
in the films. The insets show images of the aged samples (around 2.8 cm × 2.8 cm) after 72 h of light-soaking at 60–65 °C.

and perovskite (100) peak intensity in XRD patterns of control film and films with different ionic additives during light ageing at 70–75 °C.

solution or from solutions containing PbI 2
and different BMIM-containing ionic liquids (molar ratio 1/1) on NiO/FTO substrates:

e , XRD patterns. The size of the substrate is around 2.8 cm × 2.8 cm. The PbI 2 /BMIMBF 4
film retains the colour of PbI 2
and exhibit a polycrystalline PbI 2
feature.
f , ToF-SIMS depth profiles, measured in negative polarity, of perovskite film containing BMIMCl (0.3 mol%) on an NiO/FTO substrate. Full size image In order to understand which component of the ionic liquid—[BMIM] +
or [BF 4 ] − —is important for improving the device efficiency and the film stability, we assess the impact of a range of different ionic additives. We first characterize devices with added FABF 4 , obtaining efficiencies comparable to that of the control (Extended Data Fig.
4a ), with no improvement in the film stability (Fig.
3b
and Extended Data Fig.
4b ). By replacing the [BF 4 ] −
with halide (X) anions—for example, I − , Br −
or Cl − —and retaining the [BMIM] +
cation, we replicate the improved stability of the perovskite films (Fig.
3b
and Extended Data Fig.
4b ), but find a substantial decrease in the device efficiencies (Extended Data Fig.
4a ). Thus both [BMIM] +
and [BF 4 ] −
are required to improve the film’s stability while simultaneously enhancing the device efficiency. In order to elucidate the differences between adding BMIMBF 4
versus BMIMX, we investigate the interaction between PbI 2
and these BMIM-based ionic liquids. From photographs of the films, we observe that the PbI 2 /BMIMBF 4
film retains the yellow colouration of PbI 2 , while all of the PbI 2 /BMIMX samples are optically transparent (Fig.
3c ), suggesting the formation of lead halide/imidazolium halide complexes. We find further evidence for the formation of PbI 2 /BMIMX complexes in the corresponding film absorption and XRD results (Fig.
3d, e ). Furthermore, all of the BMIM-based ionic liquids investigated greatly suppress the emergence of crystalline PbI 2 . To further probe the differences between the ionic liquids comprising halide ions and those comprising [BF 4 ] −
ions, we investigate the compositional distribution of halide throughout a BMIMCl-containing perovskite film. According to our ToF-SIMS results, Cl −
ions distribute throughout the thickness of the film (Fig.
3f ), unlike [BF 4 ] −
ions (Fig.
2b ), indicating that if PbI 2 /BMIMX complexes do exist within BMIMX-containing perovskite films, they are likely to be found throughout the bulk film. For completeness, we investigate whether BMIMBF 4
needs to be incorporated within the perovskite film, or if it can be pre-processed onto the substrate before perovskite deposition. For cells fabricated through the latter approach—which we term ‘with BMIMBF 4
at the perovskite/NiO interface’—we observe improvement in device efficiency compared with control cells, with a higher
V OC
and fill factor (Extended Data Fig.
4c
and Extended Data Table1). This result is consistent with the idea that the enhanced efficiency of cells based on BMIMBF 4 -containing perovskite films is related to an improvement in interfacial properties when BMIMBF 4
accumulates at the perovskite/NiO interface. However, film stability does not noticeably improve in such devices (Extended Data Fig.
4d ). Therefore, we conclude that the improved stability of devices based on BMIMBF 4 -containing perovskite films stems mainly from the presence of BMIM, with the BF 4
ensuring that the introduced ionic liquid does not negatively affect the film properties and device performance of the ensuing solar cells. We assume that, in the as-crystallized films, the large [BMIM] +
ions are excluded from the perovskite crystals and hence accumulate at the surface and grain boundaries of the perovskite film. We postulate that the [BMIM] +
cations will bind to surface sites that would have otherwise been susceptible to degradation via oxygen or moisture adsorption and subsequent reactions under light and heat 27 , and hence suppress the degradation of the perovskite active layer. However, as is the case for films processed with BMIMX, we speculate that the readily formed large-band-gap complexes of PbI 2 /BMIMX disrupt the perovskite lattice or introduce surface strain, and hence introduce electronic defects into the active layer, inhibiting the photovoltaic performance of the resulting devices. Having demonstrated the improved stability of BMIMBF 4 -containing perovskite films, we proceed to investigate the stability of complete photovoltaic cells under combined heat and light stressing. We first test the stability performance of non-encapsulated devices under full-spectrum sunlight at 60–65 °C (Fig.
4a ). Rather like the freshly made devices, we notice light-soaking improvements during
J – V
measurements of the aged devices (Extended Data Fig.
5a ), and present the final PCEs based on peak
J – V
values for non-encapsulated cells as a function of ageing time in Fig.
4a . We observe no degradation for both types of device (with or without BMIMBF 4 ) during the first 20 hours. By contrast with our previous best reported stability 6
and that found in other studies of negative–intrinsic–positive perovskite solar cells 5 , we do not here observe an early-time light-induced degradation, or ‘burn-in’. This is already a key step forward, and we assign this primarily to our use of a positive–intrinsic–negative device structure comprising NiO as a hole conductor and a Cr/Cr 2 O 3
interlayer 22 , 28 . For the control device, the PCE quickly decreases to around zero after roughly another 80 hours of ageing. By contrast, the BMIMBF 4 -containing device retains about 86% of its initial performance after 100 hours of ageing in air. The control device discolours in the regions beyond the electrode-protected area, whereas the BMIMBF 4 -containing device shows no visible discolouration (Fig.
4a , insets), consistent with the idea that the enhanced device stability originates from the improved stability of the BMIMBF 4 -containing perovskite active layer. Fig. 4: Device stability under combined full-spectrum sunlight and heat stressing. a , Evolution of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of a non-encapsulated control device and a device with BMIMBF 4
in the perovskite film, during ageing under full-spectrum sunlight at 60–65 °C in air with relative humidity (RH) ranging from 40% to 50%. The insets show pictures of the perovskite cells after 100 h of ageing (the size of the substrate is around 2.8 cm × 2.8 cm).
b ,
c , Stability performance of the encapsulated solar cells under full-spectrum sunlight at 70–75 °C. PCE ( b ) and SPO ( c ), including standard errors, were calculated from ten devices (and from the best performing eight devices for the SPO) with BMIMBF 4
in the perovskite film, and from seven devices (and from the best performing four devices for the SPO) for the other two sets of devices. The top and bottom stars in the PCE and SPO stability curves for devices with BMIMBF 4
in the perovskite film represent the maximum and minimum values, respectively.
d , Long-term stability performance of the most stable device with BMIMBF 4
in the perovskite film, under full-spectrum sunlight and heat stressing at 70–75 °C. The device parameters were collected from the peak FB-to-SC
J–V
curves for this device. The concentration of the BMIMBF 4
in the perovskite film is 0.3 mol% with respect to the lead atoms. Full size image We encapsulate a series of cells and probe their long-term stability. We measure improvements in device performance and, in some cases, an obvious decrease in hysteresis in the
J–V
curves after device encapsulation (Extended Data Fig.
5b, c ). In Extended Data Fig.
5d , we compare the stability of devices comprising BMIMBF 4
within the perovskite film with those comprising BMIMBF 4
at the perovskite/NiO interface, under full-spectrum sunlight at 60–65 °C. We observe no obvious degradation of the encapsulated devices under this ageing condition. For the devices based on BMIMBF 4 -containing perovskite film, we measure an increase in both the
J – V -derived efficiency and the SPO, together with a ‘healing’ of the
J – V
hysteresis after 150 hours of ageing (Extended Data Fig.
5e, f ). We then allow the chamber temperature to rise to between 70 °C and 75 °C, and again evaluate the device stability. We show the evolution of device parameters in Fig.
4b, c
and Extended Data Fig.
6a–c . We measure very little degradation in
J – V -determined efficiency for cells based on BMIMBF 4 -containing perovskite film, and a faster degradation of control devices. The cells with BMIMBF 4
at the perovskite/NiO interface also degrade at a similar rate to the control cells under this higher-temperature ageing. Therefore, it appears essential that the BMIMBF 4
is within the perovskite absorber in order to enhance the stability. However, we observe increased hysteresis and, in some instances, the emergence of overshoot in the
J – V
curves for devices based on BMIMBF 4 -containing perovskite films during higher-temperature light stressing (Extended Data Fig.
6d ). For such devices, the SPO values also degrade more quickly than the
J – V -determined efficiency, and we observe a roughly 20% decrease in the initial performance after 1,072 hours of ageing (Fig.
4c ). By comparison, for the control cells and that with BMIMBF 4
at the perovskite/NiO interface, we observe a roughly 35–40% drop in the SPO over the same ageing period. In Fig.
4d
we show the longer-term stability results for the most-stable cell with BMIMBF 4
in the perovskite film, aged under full-spectrum sunlight at the elevated temperature (70–75 °C). We observe a slow increase in the
J – V -derived efficiency at the beginning of ageing. However, we also measure a small early-time burn-in of the SPO during the first 100 hours or so, coincident with enhanced
J – V
hysteresis under the high-temperature ageing, and proceed to measure a relatively slow drop in the SPO during the extended ageing test. We present the
J – V
and the measured SPO curves at different ageing times in Extended Data Fig.
7a–f , clearly showing the evolution of device performance—including the increased hysteresis in the
J – V
curves—during long-term ageing. Remarkably, the most-stable device based on BMIMBF 4 -containing perovskite film exhibits only around 5% degradation in the
J – V -derived efficiency and around 15% degradation in the SPO over the entire 1,885-hour ageing test. By fitting the degradation data of the most-stable device based on BMIMBF 4 -containing perovskite film (as in Extended Data Fig.
8 ), we estimate a time to 80% of the peak PCE ( T 80 ) of roughly 5,200 hours, and the
T 80
of the post-burn-in SPO to be about 4,100 hours. The
T 80
values of our
J – V -determined PCE and SPO are respectively 1.3 and 2.4 times as great as our previous best reported values for negative–intrinsic–positive solar cells 28 , which were aged at a lower temperature of 50–60 °C and exhibited a severe early-time burn-in, with over 20% of the initial efficiency lost within the first few hundred hours. We would expect that an additional degradation-acceleration factor due to a temperature increase is in the region of fourfold (twofold per 10 °C increase in temperature) 29 . We therefore estimate that the cells we present here are in the region of five to ten times more stable than our previous most stable devices. To put our results into a broader context, we tabulate the long-term stability performance of perovskite solar cells from the literature in Extended Data Table
2 , specifying the device structures, the ageing conditions, the degradation factors and the estimated
T 80
values. By comparison with the cells with the longest
T 80
values measured under combined light and heat stressing 10 , our cells are stressed under ultraviolet-light-containing full-spectrum sunlight at temperatures about 10–15 °C higher, yet deliver a comparable
T 80
lifetime, indicating that our cells are likely to be at least twice as stable. We note that all of the results in Extended Data Table
2
were measured under slightly different conditions (light source, atmosphere, electric bias, temperature, and so on). Ultimately, standardized measurement conditions with which to fairly compare experimental results in different laboratories would greatly benefit the community 30 . To demonstrate the applicability of our strategy for improving operational stability to different perovskite absorber materials, we undertake a similar ageing test with the ‘unstable’ perovskite MAPbI 3
in the same positive–intrinsic–negative device structure (Extended Data Fig.
9a–h ). For cells based on BMIMBF 4 -containing MAPbI 3 , ageing at about 60–65 °C, we observe a similar improvement in device performance during the first 100 hours, while the performance of control cells decreases slightly. We then set the temperature of the ageing box to about 70–75 °C for a short period, and observe a fast decrease in both the device efficiency and the SPO for all devices. We then drop the temperature back to 60–65 °C and proceed with the ageing. The control devices exhibit a faster degradation after the higher-temperature ageing, and their performance quickly decreases to about 60% of the original values after about 400 hours. By contrast, devices with BMIMBF 4
in the MAPbI 3
perovskite slowly recover to their initial efficiency before the high-temperature ageing, and show less than 10% degradation in both the
J – V -derived efficiency and the SPO after about 400 hours of ageing under full-spectrum light and heat stressing (Extended Data Fig.
9 ). In summary, we have presented a simple, broadly applicable method that greatly enhances the long-term operational stability of perovskite solar cells. Our approach represents another milestone towards stable perovskite-based photovoltaic technology, and is likely to be applicable to other optoelectronic applications that use metal halide perovskites. Methods Materials Detailed information on all chemicals used here is listed in Supplementary Table
1 . Substrate preparation Fluoride-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass substrates (Pilkington TEC 7, sheet resistance 7–8 ohms per square) were etched with zinc powder and 2 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) to produce desired patterns. The substrates were cleaned with a 2 vol% solution of Hellmanex cuvette-cleaning detergent, then washed with deionized water and ethanol, and dried with dry nitrogen. The substrates were treated with UV-ozone for 10 min before use. Substrates coated with poly[ N , N ′-bis(4-butylphenyl)- N , N ′-bisphenylbenzidine] (poly-TPD) were fabricated as described 31 . The nickel oxide (NiO) precursor (0.1 M) was prepared by dissolving nickel acetylacetonate (Ni(acac) 2 ) in anhydrous ethanol, and HCl (1%
v / v ) was used as the stabilizer. The precursor solution was stirred overnight at room temperature, filtered (0.45 µm, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)), and spin-coated on cleaned FTO substrates at 4,000 r.p.m. for 40 s. The films were dried at 180 °C for 10 min and then sintered at 400 °C in air for 45 min to obtain a compact NiO layer. For the BMIMBF 4 -treated substrates, a 3 mg ml −1
BMIMBF 4
solution in ethanol was spin-coated onto the NiO substrates at 6,000 r.p.m., followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min in a glove box. The relative humidity during spin-coating and thermal annealing of NiO films ranged from 40% to 50% in our clean room. Preparation of perovskite precursor solutions All chemicals used for the perovskite precursor solutions are listed in Supplementary Table
1 . We prepared the (FA 0.83 MA 0.17 ) 0.95 Cs 0.05 Pb(I 0.9 Br 0.1 ) 3
triple-cation perovskite precursor solution (1.3 M) by dissolving formamidinium iodide (FAI, 176.6 mg) and methylammonium iodide (MAI, 33.1 mg), CsI (16.9 mg), PbI 2
(509.4 mg) and PbBr 2
(71.6 mg) in 1 ml of a mixed anhydrous solvent of
N , N -dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and
N -methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP). The ratio of the solvents was fixed at 4/0.9/0.1 (DMF/DMSO/NMP) by volume. In parallel, we prepared ionic liquids containing perovskite precursor solution by dissolving the same components in mixed solvent containing different ionic liquids (1.2 mol%). The perovskite precursor solutions were stirred overnight in the glove box and filtered (0.45 µm, PTFE) before spin-coating. The ionic-liquid-containing precursor solutions of desired concentrations were prepared by mixing the precursor without and with ionic liquid (1.2 mol%) at different ratios. The precursor solutions for MAPbI 3
perovskite (1.4 M) were prepared by dissolving PbI 2
and MAI with a molar ratio of 1/1 in anhydrous DMF/DMSO (4/1, volume ratio) without and with BMIMBF 4
(0.3 mol%). The perovskite precursor solutions were stirred overnight in the glove box and filtered (0.45 µm, PTFE) before use. Device fabrication Triple-cation perovskite films were deposited in the glove box using a solvent-quenching method 32
with anisole as the antisolvent. In detail, 100 µl perovskite precursor solution was dropped on the NiO-coated FTO substrates (2.8 × 2.8 cm) and spin-coated at 1,300 r.p.m. for 5 s (5-s ramp) and 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s (5-s ramp). We quickly dropped 250 μl anhydrous anisole onto the substrates 5 s before the end of the program. The samples were immediately put on a preheated hot plate and annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. For MAPbI 3
films, the precursor solution was spin-coated at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s in a dry box with a controlled humidity of about 20% (ref.
33 ). We dropped 250 μl anhydrous anisole onto the substrates 10 s before the end of the program. The films were annealed at 80 °C for 5 min. PCBM solution with a concentration of 20 mg ml −1
in chlorobenzene (CB)/1,2-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) (3/1,
v / v ) was spin-coated on top of the perovskite films at a speed of 1,800 r.p.m. for 30 s. The samples were then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. After cooling to room temperature, we dynamically spin-coated bathocuproine (BCP) solution (0.5 mg ml −1
in isopropanol) on top of the PCBM at a speed of 4,000 r.p.m. for 20 s. We took the samples from the glove box and finished the devices by thermally evaporating chromium (3.5 nm) and gold (100 nm) electrodes under a vacuum of 6 × 10 −6  torr. Characterization of solar cells We measured
J–V
curves in air with a Keithley 2400 source meter under AM1.5 sunlight generated using an ABET Class AAB sun 2000 simulator. The mismatch factor for the test cell, the light source and the National Renewable Energy Laboratories (NREL)-calibrated KG5 filtered silicon reference cell was estimated and applied in order to correctly estimate the equivalent AM1.5 irradiance level. Before measurement of each set of devices, the intensity of the solar simulator was automatically measured using a KG5 reference cell, and this recorded intensity (which typically varied from 99 mW cm −2
to 105 mW cm −2 ) was used to calculate the precise power conversion efficiency, where power conversion efficiency is: (electrical power out/solar light power in) × 100%. All devices were masked with a 0.0919 cm −2
metal aperture to define the active area and to eliminate edge effects. The
J – V
curves were measured at a scan rate of 200 mV s −1
(delay time of 100 ms) from 1.2 V to −0.2 V and then back again (from −0.2 V to 1.2 V). A stabilization time of 2 s at forward bias of 1.2 V under illumination was done before scanning. We measured the cells multiple times until a peak performance was achieved. This typically took two to five
J – V
scans, in a measurement time of around 1–2 min. External quantum efficiency measurements were performed using custom-built Fourier transform photocurrent spectroscopy based on the Bruker Vertex 80v Fourier transform spectrometer. A Newport AAA sun simulator was used as the light source and the light intensity was calibrated with a Newport-calibrated reference silicon photodiode. Film characterization The morphologies of the perovskite films on NiO-coated FTO substrates were characterized using a SEM (Hitachi S-4300) at an accelerating voltage of 3–5 kV. The diffraction patterns were measured from samples of perovskite films on NiO-coated FTO substrates using a Panalytical X’PERT Pro X-ray diffractometer. UV-Vis absorption spectra were measured using a Varian Carry 300 Bio (Agilent Technologies). Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectra were acquired using a fluorescence lifetime spectrometer (FLuo Time 300, PicoQuant). The samples were excited using a 507-nm laser (LDH-P-C-510, PicoQuant) with pulse duration of 117 ps, a fluence of about 30 nJ cm −2
per pulse and a repetition rate of 1 MHz. The photoluminescence data were collected using a high-resolution monochromator and hybrid photomultiplier detector assembly (PMA Hybrid 40, PicoQuant). The samples were prepared on thin insulating amorphous TiO 2 -coated glass substrates to avoid any impacts of morphology and structure change in the perovskite films on the photoluminescence measurements 34 . UPS and XPS measurements were carried out using a Scienta ESCA 200 spectrometer in ultrahigh vacuum with a base pressure of 1 × 10 −10  mbar. The measurement chamber was equipped with a monochromatic aluminium (Kα) X-ray source providing photons with energies of 1,486.6 eV for XPS, and a standard helium-discharge lamp with He  Ι
photons of 21.22 eV for UPS. The XPS experimental condition was set so that the full width at half maximum of the clean gold 4 f 7/2
line (at a binding energy of 84.00 eV) was 0.65 eV. The total energy-resolution UPS measurement is about 80 meV as extracted from the width of the Fermi level (at the binding energy of 0.00 eV) of clean gold foil. All spectra were measured at a photoelectron takeoff angle of 0° (normal emission). The work function of film was extracted from the edge of the secondary electron cutoff of the UPS spectra by applying a bias of −3 V to the sample. ToF-SIMS measurements Compositional depth profiling of perovskite films was carried out using a ToF-SIMS 5 system from IONTOF, operated in the spectral mode and using a 25-keV Bi 3 +
primary ion beam with an ion current of 0.7 pA. A mass-resolving power of about 8,000 m ∆m −1
was reached. For depth profiling, a 500-eV Cs +
sputter beam with a current of 28 nA was used to remove material layer by layer in interlaced mode, from a raster area of 300 µm × 300 µm. Mass spectrometry was performed on an area of 100 µm × 100 µm in the centre of the sputter crater. A low-energy electron-flood gun was used for charge compensation. In the positive polarity, the [SnO + Cs] +
secondary ion is the SnO fragment ionized through interaction with the sputter ion Cs + , yielding the highest signal-to-noise-ratio positive-secondary-ion signal characteristic of the FTO substrate. In-plane electronic device characterization For photoluminescence imaging experiments under an electric field, perovskite films on glass samples were deposited with planar gold electrodes on top (channel width of about 150 µm). Characterization was performed as described 23 , 24
using a home-built photoluminescence imaging microscope. Based on commercial microscopy (Microscope Axio Imager.A2m), samples were illuminated by a LED illuminator using an excitation filter and dicroic mirror (HC 440 SP, AHF Analysentechnik AG), allowing excitation at 440 nm. The excitation power could be controlled and was set to roughly 34 mW cm −2
in the focus plane using an infinity-corrected objective (×10/0.25 HD, Zeiss). The photoluminescence light was filtered (HC-BS 484, AHF Analysentechnik AG) to suppress residual excited light and directed to the microscope with the same objective lens. The photoluminescence signal was imaged with a charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera (Pco. Pixelfly, PCO AG) with an exposure time of 200 ms. The perovskite films were placed in the focal plane of the objective lens. The photoluminescence changing process was recorded with a constant 10 V voltage being applied between the gold electrodes (Keithley 236 Source Measure Unit). Characterization of film and device stability The complete perovskite solar cells were simply encapsulated with a cover glass (LT-Cover, Lumtec) and UV adhesive (LT-U001, Lumtec) in a nitrogen-filled glove box. All of the non-encapsulated perovskite films on NiO/FTO substrates, the encapsulated devices and the non-encapsulated devices were aged in an Atlas SUNTEST XLS+ (1,700 W air-cooled xenon lamp) light-soaking chamber under simulated full-spectrum AM1.5 sunlight with 76 mW cm −2
irradiance. All devices were aged under open-circuit conditions, and were taken out from the chamber and tested at different time intervals under a separate solar simulator (AM1.5, 99 to 105 mW cm −2 ) for
J – V
characterization. No additional ultraviolet filter was used during the whole ageing process. During the ageing test, the temperature of the light ageing chamber was initially set between 60 °C and 65 °C, and proceeded to between 70 °C and 75 °C, as measured on a black temperature standard inserted into the ageing box positioned at the same level and the same orientation as the solar cells. When measuring the cells during ageing, we removed them from the ageing chamber and allow them to cool to room temperature, which typically took a few minutes. The relative humidity in the laboratory was within 40% to 60% during the entire ageing test.

Many experimental methods are available for the characterization of nanostructures, but most of them are limited by stringent experimental conditions. When it comes to analysing nanostructures in the bulk or in their natural environment – even as ordinary as water at room temperature – small-angle scattering (SAS) of X-rays or neutrons is often the only option. The rapid worldwide development of synchrotron and neutron facilities over recent decades has opened unprecedented possibilities for using SAS
in situ
and in a time-resolved way. But, in spite of its huge potential in the field of nanomaterials in general, SAS is covered far less than other characterization methods in non-specialized curricula. Presented here is a rigorous discussion of small-angle scattering, at a technical level comparable to the classical undergraduate coverage of X-ray diffraction by crystals and which contains diffraction as a particular case.

– is that we cannot see them with the naked eye. Or when we can,
e.g.
using
electron microscopy,
the observation conditions are very different from the sample's natural conditions. Frozen, desiccated or metallized nano­structures in an electron beam may have little in common with their natural state swollen in water, undergoing thermal motion and surrounded by all types of ions. Moreover, the amount of material characterized in any microscopy observation is so small that one can always doubt whether it is representative of the sample as a whole. In many situations, therefore, workers in the field of nanomaterials have to rely on indirect characterization methods, whereby a macroscopic amount of sample is analysed in its normal environment but only incomplete structural information is obtained. Small-angle scattering (SAS) is such a method. In its principle, SAS is very similar to better-known diffraction experiments (Guinier & Fournet, 1955 ; Glatter & Kratky, 1982 ). In its most popular form, an X-ray (small-angle X-ray scattering, SAXS) or neutron (small-angle neutron scattering, SANS) beam is shone on a sample and the intensity of the scattered beam is measured downstream as a function of the angle [Fig. 1 ( a )]. Accurate measurement of scattering at angles lower than a few degrees poses specific experimental difficulties (Schmatz
et al. , 1974 ). In the present discussion, however, we focus on the principle of the method and on the structural significance of the measured signal. From that perspective, the main difference from diffraction experiments is that the angles investigated with SAS are much shallower. To some extent, SAS can be thought of as the analysis of the fine structure of what might be considered as the transmitted beam in a typical diffraction experiment. In order to resolve small scattering angles experimentally, the detector must generally be positioned far away from the sample, so SAS instruments are generally large [Figs. 1 ( b ) and 1 ( c )].

et al. , 2015 ). ( c ) The synchrotron small-angle scattering setup on the Dutch–Belgian beamline (BM26) of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (image courtesy of Professor B. Goderis). In both cases, the path of the beam is from the right to the left.
The physical principles underlying the SAS signal are sketched in Fig. 2 . In the case of X-rays, any electron met by the incoming beam is accelerated by its oscillating electric field, and this results in the emission of secondary electromagnetic waves with identical frequency. In the case of SANS, the incoming neutrons interact with nuclei present in the sample via the strong nuclear force, and the scattering is a quantum-mechanical effect concerning the wavefunctions of both neutron and atomic nuclei. In the context of the Born approximation (Squires, 2012 ; Loh, 2017 ), however, each nucleus met by the neutron beam can also be thought of as the source of a secondary wavefunction. Therefore, although the physics of X-ray and neutron scattering are quite different, their geometric aspects can be discussed in terms of the same classical Huygens-like description of wave propagation in Fig. 2 . In both cases, the intensity measured on the detector results from the interference of all secondary waves as a function of the scattering angle
θ . Analysing SAS patterns consists of inferring structural information from the thus-measured intensities.
Figure 2
A Huygens-like description of a scattering experiment. When an incoming beam of wavelength
λ
is shone on a sample, each material point hit by it becomes the source of an isotropic secondary wave of identical wavelength. The intensity measured on a detector at any given angle
θ
results from the interference of all the secondary waves.
Although SAXS can be measured on commercial laboratory instruments, users of the technique also benefit from the worldwide development of large-scale facilities such as synchrotrons and free-electron lasers, many of which have instruments dedicated to small-angle scattering. Fig. 3
testifies to the booming of the field over the past few decades. Historically, starting from the 1960s, first-generation synchrotrons were particle accelerators built for physics research. As a consequence of the acceleration of charged particles, these instruments inevitably produced X-rays, but this was largely considered a nuisance. Second-generation synchrotrons were particle accelerators deliberately built as intense X-ray sources for characterization studies. From approximately 1990 to 2010, the worldwide development of optimized third-generation synchrotrons took place at the impressive pace of one new facility commissioned yearly, and this is continuing with the current development of free-electron lasers as a fourth-generation synchrotron source (Margaritondo & Rebernik Ribic, 2011 ). Since the 1960s, the
brilliance
of synchrotron sources has tripled every eighteen months (Rubensson, 2016 ), so that current synchrotron beams are billions of times more intense than X-rays emitted by, say, rotating anodes. In addition to higher intensity, synchrotron beams are also more coherent, better focused, with a broader energy spectrum available
etc. , which enables a wealth of scattering experiments that are impossible on laboratory sources. The difference between synchrotron and laboratory X-rays is often likened to the difference between a laser and a light bulb.

Comparable progress has taken place in the field of neutron facilities, which developed at a fast pace all through the second half of the 20th century, based on both nuclear reactors and spallation sources (Rush, 2015 ). A major event in the field is the current development of the European Spallation Source, anticipated to become the most brilliant neutron source worldwide (Santoro
et al. , 2020 ; Andersen
et al. , 2020 ). The increasing number of facilities and
brilliance
of the sources has been accompanied by qualitative improvements in the instrumentation, with better optics, detectors, instrument control, data analysis tools
etc.
(Koch, 2010 ; Andersen
et al. , 2020 ) The fields of application of SAS are extremely numerous as it can in principle be applied to study any nanoscale system. The following are just a few examples, which are inevitably biased towards the authors' scientific interests. Among others, SAS is routinely used to analyse nanostructures in solution, which is invaluable for colloids and proteins (Tuukkanen
et al. , 2017 ; Gräwert & Svergun, 2020 ). Nanostructures can also be analysed in working conditions, while materials are being mechanically deformed (Pawlak & Galeski, 2005 ) or submitted to a variety of thermal, chemical or electromagnetic stimuli (Bailey, 2003 ; Hamley
et al. , 2004 ; Fujii
et al. , 2012 ). Nanostructures can also be studied under extreme experimental conditions. Spectacular examples are the
in situ
analysis of nanostructured soot formation in flames (di Stasio
et al. , 2006 ) and fireball lightning (Mitchell
et al. , 2008 ). SAS also enables biochemical structures and processes to be studied in biological tissues
in vivo
at the nanometre scale, such as the spinning of spider silk (Riekel & Vollrath, 2001 ) or muscle contraction (Ait-Mou
et al. , 2016 ). The availability of different types of beams for performing SAS experiments adds to the versatility of the method. In addition to X-rays and neutrons, scattering experiments can also be done with electrons, visible light or muons (obtained as by-products of neutrons in spallation sources) (Windsor, 1988 ; Pynn, 1990 ). The various probes differ in the sample characteristics they are sensitive to, yielding different types of contrasts. In the case of neutrons, this capability is further expanded through the possibility of isotope substitution. Another important characteristic of a probe is its
penetration depth,
which may enable or forbid certain types of experiment. The different
brilliance
of the sources is also central for choosing a probe for time-resolved studies
etc.
Often, different types of scattering technique are combined, each of which provides different and complementary information on the investigated system. (Allen
et al. , 2007 ; Whitten & Trewhella, 2009 ; Genix & Oberdisse, 2015 ). Despite its huge potential as a characterization technique for nanostructures in general – across the fields of chemistry, physics, biology and materials science – SAS remains relatively unpopular in most scientific curricula compared with other experimental methods. This is partly due to its reputation as a very indirect technique, the thorough understanding of which requires a strong taste for mathematics. The aim of the present paper is to show that most SAS data can be analysed qualitatively, yet rigorously, with minimal mathematical background. The reader is referred to excellent monographs (Guinier & Fournet, 1955 ; Glatter & Kratky, 1982 ; Feigin & Svergun, 1987 ), textbooks (Sivia, 2011 ) and other educational material (Schmatz
et al. , 1974 ; Zaccai & Jacrot, 1983 ; Windsor, 1988 ; Pynn, 1990 ; Hammouda, 1995 ; Roe, 2000 ; Jaksch, 2019 ; Hamley, 2021 ) for a more thorough, but also more technical, coverage of the subject.
2. Structural significance of small-angle scattering
For reasons that will soon be clear, SAS intensities are plotted not against the scattering angle
θ
but against the magnitude of the scattering wavevector
q , defined as
where
λ
is the wavelength of the X-rays or neutrons. The physical meaning of
q
is that ℏ q
is the momentum transfer to the photon or neutron during the scattering event. In the context of diffraction studies, the scattering angle is sometimes defined as 2 θ
instead of
θ . In that context,
q
is therefore defined as being proportional to sin( θ ), but this is the same physical quantity. Among other advantages, scattering patterns plotted against
q
are independent of the particular wavelength selected for the experiment, which would not be the case if they were plotted against
θ . Fig. 4
displays four data sets that are representative of qualitatively different types of scattering pattern that one often encounters when applying SAS. For now, we only highlight their most distinctive features, which we will discuss and explain in detail in the rest of the paper. Fig. 4 ( a ) is a SAXS pattern measured on ordered nanoporous silica, consisting of a hexagonal array of cylindrical pores a few nanometres across (Gommes
et al. , 2016 ). The scattering peaks can be interpreted in terms of diffraction by the periodic pore structure, but with a periodicity in the nanometre range corresponding to the distance between the pores. Many materials do not exhibit periodicity on the nanometre scale and their SAS patterns do not exhibit any sharp peak. One such pattern is plotted in Fig. 4 ( b ), which was measured by SANS on an aqueous
colloidal suspension
of latex nano­particles (Hammouda, 1995 ). The pattern seems featureless on linear scales, except for a slight hump around
q
= 0.01 Å −1 . On logarithmic scales, however, the scattered intensity exhibits a plateau at small
q , followed by an oscillatory decrease. Fig. 4 ( c ) displays a SAXS pattern obtained by shining a synchrotron beam through a laboratory model of fireball lightning (Mitchell
et al. , 2008 ). The SAXS pattern is dominated by an
I  ≃
q −4
trend at large values of
q , which appears as linear on the double logarithmic scales of the inset. The last pattern [Fig. 4 ( d )] was obtained by neutron scattering on a 50:50% blend of deuterated and protonated polystyrene, which provides strong scattering contrast to half of the polymer chains (Hammouda, 1995 ). This pattern too exhibits an overall power-law scattering that levels off towards smaller values of
q , but the scattering exponent is here close to 2.

and

In the context of scattering, it is difficult for anybody with a scientific education not to think of Bragg's law, and this can be misleading in the context of SAS. Bragg's law is concerned with diffraction, which is a very specific scattering phenomenon that happens only with periodic structures. In that case, the beam is scattered exclusively at well defined diffraction angles
θ d , which are related to the periodicities
d
of the structure via (Sivia, 2011 ; Loh, 2017 )
where
n
is any positive integer. Before discussing SAS, it is important to emphasize that Bragg's law is not a general law of scattering but a consequence of the general principles of Fig. 2 , when particularized to spatially periodic structures. In the specific case of Fig. 4 ( a ), one can use equation (2 ) to infer the spacing between pores from the positions of the peaks, but we shall see that the scattering pattern contains much more structural information than that. Moreover, equation (2 ) is irrelevant and useless in cases of non-periodic structures, such as in Figs. 4 ( b )–4 ( d ). Analysing from Fig. 2
the general conditions for destructive or constructive interference of all secondary waves when they reach the detector, in relation to all possible sizes and shapes of the electron- or nucleus-containing nanostructures, may seem at first to be a difficult task. The following two observations make it simpler. First, under the conditions of SAS the emission of secondary waves can be assumed to be isotropic (Glatter & Kratky, 1982 ; Sivia, 2011 ). Second, provided the sample is sufficiently thin the secondary waves reach the detector without being scattered a second time (Frielinghaus, 2018 ), so it is only the unperturbed incoming beam that is responsible for the secondary waves. As a consequence, for any given scattering angle
θ , that is for a given pixel of the detector, the phase
ϕ
of a specific secondary wave reaching the detector depends
only
on the position ( x ,  y ,  z ) of the scattering centre. In other words, for any given angle
θ
one can calculate a phase map
ϕ θ ( x ,  y ,  z ) which is a characteristic of the instrument. That function is the phase of the secondary wave that would reach the detector in the event that the sample had a scattering centre at a point ( x ,  y ,  z ). The scattered intensity is then obtained as a second step, by comparing the sample-independent phase map
ϕ θ ( x ,  y ,  z ) with the actual spatial distribution of electrons or nuclei in the considered sample. The phase map can be thought of as the spectacles through which any sample is analysed in a SAS experiment. It is therefore occasionally referred to as the probe wave (Windsor, 1988 ). The phase map is different for each scattering angle, which is why a full scattering pattern measured over a wide angular range provides rich structural information. Calculating the phase map for a given angle
ϕ θ ( x ,  y ,  z ) is a purely geometric question. Starting from any given point ( x ,  y ,  z ) two half lines are drawn, one towards the source and the other towards the detector. Their lengths are the distances travelled by the primary and secondary waves, respectively. Let us call the sum of the two lengths
L ( x ,  y ,  z ). Because the scattering is instantaneous and the phase of a wave increases by a quantity 2 π
each time the wave travels a distance equal to its wavelength
λ , the phase map is obtained by multiplying
L ( x ,  y ,  z ) by 2 π / λ . The calculation of
L ( x ,  y ,  z ) is explained in Appendix
A
on the basis of simple trigonometry. The result is sketched in Fig. 5 : the phase map
ϕ θ ( x ,  y ,  z ) is found to take constant values on geometric planes oriented at an angle
θ /2 with respect to the incident beam. As a consequence, the phase depends only on the space coordinate perpendicular to the planes, which we call
y . With that convention, the result is written as
Here
ϕ 0
is an irrelevant constant that depends on the arbitrarily chosen origin of
y , and
q
is the same as in equation (1 ). Equation (3 ) shows that
ϕ θ ( x ,  y ,  z ) increases by 2 π
over a distance
given by
The notation
highlights the fact that this length plays the role of an apparent, and
θ -dependent, wavelength. For SAS one can approximate sin( θ /2) ≃
θ /2 in the definition of
q , so that
is approximately inversely proportional to the scattering angle,
≃
λ / θ , with
θ
expressed in radians. In other words, the smaller the angle, the larger the size of the investigated objects. For X-rays and
thermal neutrons
with
λ
in the ångström range, a typical angle of 1° ≃ 0.017 rad converts to
≃ 6 nm. This is the reason why small-angle scattering is a suitable experimental technique to probe nanometre-scaled structures.
Figure 5
For a given scattering angle
θ , the phase map
ϕ θ ( x ,  y ,  z ) is the phase of the secondary wave that would reach the detector in the event that the sample had a scattering centre (electron or nucleus) at a point ( x ,  y ,  z ). The phase map takes constant values on planes at an angle
θ /2 compared with the incoming beam, and the distance between planes with identical phases (modulo 2 π ) is
=
λ /[2sin( θ /2)].
The concept of a phase map shown in Fig. 5 , together with its quantitative relation to the observation angle
θ
in equation (4 ), is all that is needed for a qualitative understanding of SAS. Before proceeding, however, another caveat is necessary. Although Fig. 5
superficially resembles the classical textbook discussions of Bragg's law – where the
crystal lattice
planes are indeed parallel to each other and oriented at an angle of
θ /2 with respect to the incoming beam – the planes we are dealing with here are by no means material planes. They are the geometric locus of points that would lead to secondary waves reaching the detector in phase, in the event that the considered sample had scattering centres (electrons or nuclei) there.
3. Scattering by individual particles: the form factor
We consider a single nanoparticle irradiated by X-rays and a detector at some angle
θ , but the discussion also holds for neutrons, provided electrons are replaced by nuclei. The particle is assumed to be homogeneous so that the number of electrons per unit volume is the same everywhere in it. If the particle is made of silica, for example, every cubic nanometre of it contains about 700 electrons. Each of these electrons is the source of a secondary wave, which is described as a complex number
a exp( i ϕ ) when it reaches the detector. The amplitude
a
is the same for all electrons, but the phase
ϕ
depends on the electron position through
ϕ θ ( x ,  y ,  z ). The amplitude
A
of the resulting wave is the sum of the contributions of all electrons in the particle, namely
This sum has a simple geometric interpretation in the complex plane, whereby each term is associated with an arrow of length
a
and angle
ϕ , which are then added head-to-tail. This type of analysis goes back to the early introduction of complex numbers into optics by Fresnel (Karam, 2018 ) and was popularized notably by Feynman (1985 ) in his lectures on quantum electrodynamics. Equation (5 ) may apply to all electrons individually, in which case all
a
values are equal, but it is more convenient to calculate the sum by grouping the contributions of electrons with identical phases, which are all located within slices oriented at an angle
θ /2 with respect to the incoming beam (see Fig. 5 ). With such a procedure, and assuming that equal volumes of material contain equal numbers of electrons, equation (5 ) still applies with
a
proportional to the volume of the slice and
ϕ
equal to the constant value of
ϕ θ
within the slice. The resulting interference is illustrated in Fig. 6
for an arbitrarily shaped particle cut into five slices.
Figure 6
Phase-map analysis of the amplitude
A ( q ) of the wave scattered by a nanoparticle. The inset displays the nanoparticle overlaid with
ϕ θ ( x ,  y ,  z ) for the particular value
q
= 0.042 Å −1 , corresponding to
≃ 150 Å. Each slice of the particle (numbered 1 to 5) is assigned a complex number with phase
ϕ
and modulus | a | proportional to the slice volume. The amplitude of the scattered wave (in red) is obtained by adding the contributions of all slices, as in equation (5 ).
For the analysis to be mathematically accurate, the slices have to be made infinitely thin, which leads to the following expression for the scattered intensity (Guinier & Fournet, 1955 ; Glatter & Kratky, 1982 ; Feigin & Svergun, 1987 ; Pynn, 1990 ; Sivia, 2011 ; Jaksch, 2019 ): In this equation, the imaginary exponential accounts for the phase
qy
of the secondary waves originating in all electrons at a point ( x ,  y ,  z ) in line with equation (3 ),
ρ
is the electron density of the material that makes up the particle, so that
ρ  d x  d y  d z
is the number of electrons in an infinitesimal volume, and the integral replaces the sum in equation (5 ) and is responsible for the interference. Finally, we note that detectors cannot measure the amplitude of a wave but only its intensity, defined as the squared modulus
I
= | A | 2 . Equation (6 ) is valid for neutron scattering as well, provided the electron density
ρ
is replaced by the neutron scattering-length density, which characterizes how strongly the nuclei that make up the particle interact with neutrons (Pynn, 1990 ). Equation (6 ) is usually stated by saying that the scattered intensity is the squared modulus of the Fourier transform of a material's electron density. Although this may sound mathematically advanced, many aspects of it can be understood qualitatively yet rigorously from the simpler perspective of equation (5 ), through the geometric interpretation of complex numbers in Fig. 6 . For small values of
q , the periodicity of the phase map
= 2 π / q
is much larger than the size of the particle, so that all scattering centres of the particle scatter in phase. In Fig. 6 , this would correspond to a situation where all the arrows point in the same direction, which maximizes the scattered intensity. By contrast, for large values of
q
the length
is smaller than the particle, so that different parts of the particle scatter out of phase. In Fig. 6
this corresponds to arrows pointing in different directions, which results in a lower scattered intensity. This simple analysis explains the overall shape of most scattering patterns in the insets of Fig. 4 : they are globally decreasing functions with a plateau at small
q , and the transition occurs where 2 π / q
is comparable to the size of the scattering objects. The intensity
I ( q ) scattered by an individual nanoparticle over a complete range of
q
is referred to as its form factor (Pynn, 1990 ; Sivia, 2011 ) and constitutes its SAS fingerprint. It is customary to factor out the effect of the electron density and that of the particle volume
V , so that the form factor
P ( q ) is defined as
and satisfies
P ( q ) = 1 for small
q . From equation (6 ), the form factors can be calculated for a variety of particle shapes – spheres, ellipsoids, cylinders, platelets, spherical shells
etc.
– and mathematical expressions can be found in the literature (Pedersen, 1997 ). As it is often desirable to assign a single size parameter to investigated structures, one is naturally led to modelling particles as spheres. The form factor of a sphere of radius
R
is given by
which is plotted in Fig. 7
for the particular value
R
= 50 Å. The form factor of a sphere exhibits a distinctive oscillatory decrease with alternating maxima and minima of
P ( q ), as notably observed in the inset of Fig. 4 ( b ). The first minimum in the form factor corresponds to the value of
q
where the numerator of equation (8 ) vanishes, and it is found to be related to the radius of the nanoparticles via
R
≃ 4.5/ q . In the case of Fig. 4 ( b ), the experimental value
q
= 0.009 Å −1
converts to a particle radius of
R
= 50 nm, which is indeed the size of the latex nanoparticles in that sample.
Figure 7

R
= 50 Å. The phase maps
ϕ θ ( x ,  y ,  z ) corresponding to
q
values of ( a ) 0.03 Å −1 , ( b ) 0.09 Å −1
and ( c ) 0.12 Å −1
are represented in colour. For any value of
q , the nanoparticle is mentally split into slices with uniform phases, and the resulting complex amplitudes are added (as in Fig. 6 ). The resulting scattering pattern, given by equation (8 ), is shown on the right.
The oscillatory shape of the form factor of a sphere can be understood through the same geometric construction as in Fig. 6 . This is illustrated in Fig. 7
for a given sphere and three different values of
q . In the figure, the sphere is cut into slices with uniform phases and the corresponding amplitudes are added to form a meandering curve in the complex plane. The case of Fig. 7 ( a ) is relatively similar to Fig. 6 . It is representative of low- q
scattering, where all points of the sphere lead to secondary waves with similar phases. When
q
is progressively increased, destructive interference builds up, whereby different parts of the sphere lead to distinctly different phases. This corresponds to a curve that curls in the complex plane. For the specific value
q
≃ 4.5/ R
the curling is such that the curve closes head-to-tail, which is the origin of the first minimum [Fig. 7 ( b )]. Increasing
q
further, the end of the curve moves away from its starting point, until a maximum is reached corresponding to Fig. 7 ( c )
etc . A movie is provided as
supporting information
to illustrate this in an animated way. If the nanoparticles in a sample do not all have the same exact size or shape, the conditions for constructive and destructive interference differ from one particle to the next. Therefore, the presence of sharp oscillations in an experimental SAS pattern testifies to a narrow size distribution. This situation contrasts with Figs. 4 ( c ) or 4 ( d ), which exhibit a scattered intensity that decreases continuously with
q , as is typical of polydisperse systems. When plotted on double logarithmic scales (inset) the scattered intensities display two regimes: a plateau at low
q
followed by a decreasing intensity, with the transition happening for
comparable to the particle size. From equation (6 ) it can be shown that, for a single particle, the progressive onset of destructive interference for small values of
q
obeys a universal law that is independent of the particle shape, namely (Guinier & Fournet, 1955 ; Glatter & Kratky, 1982 ; Feigin & Svergun, 1987 ; Sivia, 2011 ; Jaksch, 2019 )
where
R G
is the
radius of gyration
of the particle. The latter is defined such that
is the average squared distance between any point of the particle and its centre of mass. Equation (9 ) is known as Guinier's law, and it provides a universal and model-independent way of determining particle sizes from SAS data. Plotting experimental scattering data as
ln[ I ( q )]
against
q 2
often yields a linear trend at low
q , the slope of which is
. Assuming specific types of structures, the
R G
thus obtained can then be converted to more intuitive measures of the particle size. For example, the radius of a sphere is
R
= (5/3) 1/2 R G ; the length of a rod is
L
= 2(3 1/2 ) R G ; in a
linear polymer
chain with segments of length
b , the number of segments is
etc.
(Glatter & Kratky, 1982 ; Sivia, 2011 ). In addition to sizes, qualitative structural information is obtained by analysing the building up of destructive interference when
q
is increased beyond the limit of validity of equation (9 ), that is when the periodicity of the phase map
is made smaller than the particle size. This typically leads to power laws of the type
I
≃
q − α , which can easily be identified as straight lines with slope − α
on double logarithmic plots. In the insets of Fig. 4
the scattering exponent is
α
= 4 for the first three samples and
α
= 2 for the last one. The specific exponent 4 is referred to as Porod's law and is universal to all structures with clear-cut interfaces (Ciccariello
et al. , 1988 ). Porod scattering was expected in the case of the nanoporous solid in Fig. 4 ( a ), as well as that of the colloidal particles in Fig. 4 ( b ). However, its experimental observation in the case of the fireballs [Fig. 4 ( c )] is proof that they contain compact nano­structures with well defined surfaces. By contrast, the exponent 2 observed in Fig. 4 ( d ) points to a qualitatively different type of structure. Exponents close to 2 are often encountered for polymers, the structure of which on the nanometre scale consists of flexible strands folding and coiling randomly. When comparing loose and disordered structures as in Fig. 4 ( d ) with dense and compact structures as in Fig. 4 ( b ), it is intuitively understandable why the former should lead to a slower building up of destructive interference than the latter, when
q
is increased. Discussing rigorously the relation between scattering exponents
α
and specific types of structure can only be done through the application of equation (6 ) to structural models. A broad array of such models are discussed in the SAS literature (Pedersen, 1997 ), and new models are regularly being developed each time a new type of material is encountered, with characteristics that are not captured by earlier models. Beyond the type of compact objects that universally lead to Porod scattering with exponent
α
= 4, other structures include infinitely thin needles and platelets, fractal-like hierarchical aggregates, random flexible polymers, persistent polymers, branched polymers
etc . All of these lead to specific scattering exponents, as summarized in Table 1 . Experienced users of SAS have these models in mind when they analyse experimental scattering patterns. When plotting the data on double logarithmic scales, as in the insets of Fig. 4 , one can determine at a glance both the qualitative type of structure, via the exponent
α , and its approximate size, via the cutoff value of
q
where destructive interference sets in. A scattering exponent does not point to a unique type of structure, as
α
= 2 might point either to a polymer coil or to randomly oriented platelets. In the context of a specific type of material, however, this is seldom ambiguous.

4. Scattering by collections of particles: the structure factor
The discussion has focused so far on the scattering by a single particle. This has overlooked the fact that any sample contains a large number of particles, each of which contributes to the scattered intensity, with possibly constructive or destructive inter-particle interference. The contribution of a collection of particles to the scattering is captured by the
structure factor,
which can also be analysed through equation (5 ). For that purpose, the sum of the secondary waves from all electrons or nuclei in the system is decomposed into the contributions of all individual particles. The contribution of each particle is a complex number
a exp( i ϕ ), with an amplitude given by the form factor through | a | =
ρ V [ P ( q )] 1/2
and a phase
ϕ
that depends on the position of the particle. If all particles are identical the amplitude can be factored out from the sum, which leads to the following expression for the scattered intensity:
In this equation, the phase
ϕ i
of the
i th particle is the value of the phase map
ϕ θ ( x ,  y ,  z ) at the position of, say, its centre of mass. When comparing with equation (7 ), the presence of many particles and their spatial distribution are found to be accounted for by an additional factor, which is generally
q
dependent, through the angular dependence of the phase map. Consider first the case where particles are randomly positioned in space [Fig. 8 ( a )], which is a fair approximation for dilute suspensions. In that case, the random position of each particle converts to a random orientation of its vector contribution to the wave amplitude, independent of the considered
q . In other words, the amplitude of the scattered wave results from a random walk in the complex plane, whereby
N
successive steps are made with the same length
a
and random directions. As a consequence of the random orientation of each step, the average length of the walk is not proportional to the number of steps. Instead, the average squared length is proportional to
N
[see
e.g.
ch. 41 of Feynman
et al.
(2010 )]. In the present situation, this means that the averaged squared amplitude of the wave,
i.e.
the scattered intensity, is equal to
where | a | 2
is the intensity scattered by a single particle, namely
ρ 2 V 2 P ( q ), and
N
is the number of particles. The scattered intensity per unit volume of the sample irradiated by X-rays can then be written as
where
c
is the
particle concentration
in the suspension. Such proportionality of the intensity with the number of scatterers (or with their concentration) is typical of
incoherent
scattering, whereby all scatterers have uncorrelated phases. Note the difference from the form factor in Fig. 7
and equation (7 ), for which the intensity is proportional to ( ρ V ) 2 , that is to the squared number of electrons in each particle. A central characteristic of equation (12 ) is that the scattered intensity is proportional to the form factor, which is typical of dilute systems.
Figure 8
Interference patterns resulting from multiple-particle scattering, for the cases of ( a ) randomly positioned particles, ( b ) aggregated particles, ( c ) particles repelling each other and ( d ) a hexagonal crystalline structure. In each case, a typical phase map is shown with the particles in grey. In the complex-plane representation of wave amplitude, the contribution of each particle is shown as a black arrow and the resulting wave amplitude is in red. The grey annular area is the 50% confidence interval for the wave amplitude in the case where each particle has a random phase (incoherent scattering), and the dashed circle is the root-mean-square value.
In most situations the particle positions are not independent of one another, and the random-walk analysis of Fig. 8 ( a ) [leading to equation (12 )] has to be adapted. Fig. 8 ( b ) illustrates the case of particle aggregation, for aggregates with
n a
= 3 particles. The particular value of
q
chosen for the figure is such that
= 2 π / q
is larger than the aggregates, so that the phases
ϕ
of all particles within a given aggregate are statistically similar. This results in a correlated random walk in amplitude space, whereby each step in the walk is likely to have an orientation similar to the others. This leads to more elongated trajectories and to a larger intensity of the scattered wave. This can easily be understood by considering the limit of vanishingly small
q , for which
is much larger than the aggregates. In that limit all particles within an aggregate scatter coherently, so the length of a step is no longer
a
but
n a a . On the other hand, aggregates themselves scatter incoherently, so it is still a random walk but with only
N / n a
steps. The modified version of equation (11 ) is then
which shows that particle aggregation results in an
n a -fold increase in the scattered intensity in the limit of vanishingly small
q . For finite
q
the multiplying factor depends on the shape and size of the aggregates. The modified version of equation (12 ) is then
where
S ( q ) is referred to as the
structure factor.
The specific
structure factor
obtained by evaluating the sum in equation (10 ) for the considered type of aggregates is plotted in Fig. 9 ( a ). It does indeed satisfy
S
= 3 for small
q
and converges to
S
= 1 for large
q , and the transition occurs when
is comparable to the size of the aggregates. When
is much smaller than the aggregates, the phases of the contributing particles become uncorrelated and one recovers the situation described in equation (11 ). In addition to particle aggregation, SAS researchers have considered a wide variety of qualitatively different spatial statistics, and many analytical expressions are available for the corresponding structure factors (Pedersen, 1997 ).
Figure 9
Structure factors corresponding to the structures in Fig. 8
with a particle radius of
R
= 50 Å. The structures are ( a ) aggregates of three touching particles, ( b ) particles repelling each other through hard-sphere interaction with a hard-sphere radius of 2 R
and ( c ) a 2D hexagonal periodic arrangement of particles with a lattice parameter of 3 R . The dashed lines are at
S
= 1, corresponding to
incoherent scattering,
and the red dots indicate the specific values of
q
shown in Fig. 8 .
Another common situation is the case where particles repel each other, which is relevant to concentrated suspensions. In the case of Fig. 8 ( c ) this is modelled as a hard-sphere inter­action, whereby the particles cannot approach each other closer than twice their radii [see
e.g.
Kinning & Thomas (1984 )]. The repulsion in real space converts to particles being unlikely to have similar phases. In that case, the random-walk analysis of the scattered amplitude still holds but the directions of the steps are anti-correlated. This results in a scattered wave amplitude lower than in the incoherent case, which is referred to as a correlation-hole effect. The
structure factor
corresponding to this situation is plotted in Fig. 9 ( b ). In the limit of low
q , similar to the case of Fig. 8
the
structure factor
is much smaller than one. In the limit of large
q , corresponding to small
, minute differences in the particle positions lead to huge differences in their phases. The random-walk analysis becomes valid again in that limit, and
S ( q ) converges to one. The last case we consider is that of a periodic arrangement of particles, as in Fig. 8 ( d ). The figure corresponds to a very specific value of
q
and a specific orientation, for which the periodicity of the structure coincides with direction
y
of the phase map. In this exceptional configuration, all particles in the structure scatter coherently. This is manifest in Fig. 8 ( d ), where all the vectors are parallel and lead to very strong scattering. This corresponds to a diffraction condition, which is obtained when the periodicity of the phase map
coincides with the spacing
d
between planes in a crystalline arrangement. Using then equation (1 ) to express this in terms of the scattering angle, one recovers Bragg's law in the familiar form of equation (2 ). The integer
n
results from the observation that
n
is also a periodicity of the phase map for any
n . Scattering by a crystalline structure is not limited to the diffraction peaks. However, the intensity of the peaks scales like the squared number of particles, as for any coherent effect. On the other hand, the scattering between the peaks is incoherent. It therefore scales linearly with the number of particles and is hence much weaker than the peaks. Actual crystals have finite sizes and contain structural defects, both of which contribute to widening the scattering peaks beyond Bragg's condition. In the limit of large
q , all the thus-broadened peaks overlap and
S ( q ) converges to one also in this case. Note, finally, that the present discussion of diffraction in a more general context than Bragg's law enables one to understand not just the position of the peaks but also their intensities. The particle positions in Fig. 8 ( d ) were chosen to be identical to the 2D hexagonal arrangement of the pores in the experimental SAXS pattern in Fig. 4 ( a ). Compared with the
structure factor
in Fig. 9 ( c ), the measured second and third diffraction peaks seem to be almost extinct. This has nothing to do with a lack of structural periodicity, but merely results from the multiplication of the
structure factor
by the form factor of the pores, in line with equation (14 ). In the case of porous silica in Fig. 4 ( a ), the form factor of the pores has a minimum at a value of
q
that is coincidentally very close to the peak position in the
structure factor.
When all is properly accounted for, the relative intensities of the peaks in Fig. 4 ( a ) can be used to infer the pore size of the material (Gommes
et al. , 2016 ).
5. Conclusion
Although the physics of X-ray or neutron interaction with matter can be complicated to understand in detail, many geometric aspects of it are well captured by the classical Huygens–Fresnel construction of Fig. 2 . This makes the concepts of small-angle scattering easily understandable in a qualitative yet rigorous way with very little mathematics. We hope the present paper can contribute to making the technique more accessible and to promoting its use in the broad community of non-specialized scientists interested in nano­structured materials in general. The principles of wave–matter interaction exposed here are more general than small-angle scattering as they apply to many other
elastic scattering
methods common in physical chemistry laboratories. The case of X-ray diffraction has been discussed explicitly, but other examples include molecular weight determination by static
light scattering,
the characterization of colloids by dynamic
light scattering
etc . The concepts of the paper will enable teachers to discuss these many techniques in a unified way, which will help students understand them in more depth and apply them more creatively.
APPENDIX A
The phase map
ϕ θ ( x ,  y ,  z )
We address here a geometric question. Considering Fig. 2 , for a given position of the source and detector (strictly, of a given pixel in an actual detector), what is the length of a wave's trajectory from the source to the detector, which passes through a given point ( x ,  y ,  z )? To indicate that the answer depends on the detector position, we call this
L θ ( x ,  y ,  z ). Because the phase of a wave increases by a quantity 2 π
each time it travels a distance equal to the wavelength
λ , the phase is obtained as 2 π L θ ( x ,  y ,  z )/ λ . This can also be expressed as measuring the distance between the source and detector via a scatterer, in units of
λ /(2 π ). To answer the question, we choose space coordinates with axes ( x ,  y ) as shown in Fig. 10 ( a ),
i.e.
making an angle
θ /2 with the incoming beam, and
z
orthogonal to both
x
and
y . The source and detector are both assumed to be infinitely far away so that all incoming waves travel parallel to each other, as do all outgoing waves. This defines a wedge with opening angle
θ , the left-hand side of which is at a distance
L S
from the source, while the right-hand side is at a distance
L D
to the detector. The grey dot in Fig. 10
is the position of a point ( x ,  y ,  z ) for which we endeavour to calculate
L θ ( x ,  y ,  z ). With the self-explanatory notations of Fig. 10 ( b ), the total distance travelled by a wave from the source to the detector, via the electron, is
L  =
L S
+
L 1
+
L 2
+
L D .
Figure 10
Calculation of the phase of a secondary wave when it reaches the detector (same configuration as in Fig. 2 ) as a function of the position of the scattering centre. The scattering centre is shown as a grey dot and its position is specified through axes ( x ,  y ) oriented as in panel ( a ). Point C is the intersection of the plane orthogonal to the
y
axis and passing though a point ( x ,  y ). ( b ) A magnified view of panel ( a ), in which the distances
L ′,
L 1
and
L 2
are defined.
We use the notation
L ′ for the total opening of the wedge at distance
y
from the origin, as shown in Fig. 10 ( b ). Using trigonometry, one finds
L ′/2 =
y tan( θ /2). From Fig. 10 ( b ), it is also apparent that
L 1
= ( L ′/2 +
x )cos( θ /2) and
L 2
= ( L ′/2 −
x )cos( θ /2). Putting all this together leads to
The important thing about this equation is that the coordinate
x
cancels out. This means that all points on the line making an angle of
θ /2 with respect to the incoming beam would lead to secondary waves reaching the detector with the same phase. This result remains true in three dimensions, if the lines are replaced by planes orthogonal to
y . In terms of the phase
ϕ θ
= 2 π L θ / λ , this leads to the following expression:
which is the result that we were looking for, represented in Fig. 5 . Equation (3 ) results from observing that the first term in equation (16 ) is the irrelevant constant
ϕ 0 , which depends only on the arbitrary position of the axes. The factor in front of
y
in the second term of equation (16 ) is the scattering wavevector
q , defined in equation (1 ).
APPENDIX B
Incoherent scattering
as a random walk in amplitude space
We elaborate here on the relation between
incoherent scattering
and random walks in a complex amplitude plane. If the position of the scatterers is random like in Fig. 8 ( a ), the real and imaginary parts of the amplitude
A r
= Re{ A } and
A i
= Im{ A } are also random numbers. From equation (5 ), the real part is
where each phase
ϕ
is uniformly and independently distributed over [0, 2 π ). Each term in the sum has an average equal to 0 and a variance equal to
a 2 /2. If
N
is sufficiently large for the central-limit theorem to apply, the real part of the amplitude is therefore Gaussian distributed with variance
Na 2 /2. The probability density is
and the imaginary part
A i
is identically distributed. As the intensity is
, the corresponding distribution is
with d A r d A i
=
π d I . From this distribution the average intensity is 〈 I 〉 =
Na 2 , as in equation (11 ), and the percentiles can easily be calculated as reported in Fig. 8 . Equation (19 ) implicitly assumes that
A r
and
A i
are statistically independent, which is justified in the limit of large
N
(Merzbacher
et al. , 1977 ). When expressed in terms of the amplitude | A | =
I 1/2 , the distribution in equation (19 ) is known as Rayleigh's probability density function, and it was first proposed in the context of acoustics (Rayleigh, 1880 ; Merzbacher
et al. , 1977 ). Much later, Lord Rayleigh suggested it as a solution to a statistical problem posed by Pearson (1905 ) to model the travelling of mosquitoes, thereby bringing it into the field of random walks. As recalled by Nahin (2009 ), Pearson commented, `I ought to have known it, but my reading of late years has drifted into other channels, and one does not expect to find the first stage in a biometric problem in a memoir on sound.' It is a nice twist that this equation appears again in a wave propagation setting, not about acoustics but about X-ray and neutron scattering.

Abstract Dynamic light scattering (DLS), also known as photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS), is a very powerful tool for studying the diffusion behaviour of macromolecules in solution. The diffusion coefficient, and hence the hydrodynamic radii calculated from it, depends on the size and shape of macromolecules. In this review, we provide evidence of the usefulness of DLS to study the homogeneity of proteins, nucleic acids, and complexes of protein–protein or protein–nucleic acid preparations, as well as to study protein–small molecule interactions. Further, we provide examples of DLS’s application both as a complementary method to analytical ultracentrifugation studies and as a screening tool to validate solution scattering models using determined hydrodynamic radii.

Introduction Detection of light scattering from matter is a useful technique with applications in numerous scientific disciplines where, depending on the light source and detector, specific properties of molecules can be studied. In a typical light-scattering experiment, sample is exposed to a monochromatic wave of light and an appropriate detector detects the signal. One of the earliest light-scattering experiments was described by John Tyndall, which characterized light scattering from colloidal suspensions (Tyndall effect), where particles are larger than the wavelength of the incident light (Tyndall
1868 ). Soon after, Lord Rayleigh described light scattering from particles that are smaller than the wavelength of light (Rayleigh scattering), which explained both that the sky’s blue colour is a result of scattering of light due to atmospheric particles and that the refractive index of the scattering medium plays a crucial role in light scattering (Strutt
1871a ,
b ). In contrast to Rayleigh theory, Gustav Mie ( 1908 ) described a theory (Mie theory) to study the scattering of light from absorbing and non-absorbing particles that are large compared to the wavelength of light by taking into account particle shape and the difference in refractive index between particles and the medium the particles are present in. Peter Debye suggested that scattering for particles can be studied independently of assumptions on mass, size, or shape as a function of angle (Debye
1915 ), which is often referred as Rayleigh–Debye scattering. The usefulness of light scattering as a method to characterize the diffusion behaviour of particles in solution resulted from a series of seminal discoveries. Einstein and Smoluchowski proposed that liquid should be considered as a continuous medium where thermal fluctuations create inhomogeneities, which result in density and concentration fluctuations (Fluctuation theory of light scattering, Einstein ( 1910 ); v. Smoluchowski
1908 ). Einstein ( 1905 ) also established Brownian motion theory (named after Robert Brown) explaining molecular motion of particles. He established that particles were subjected to random forces due to constant collision with solvent molecules resulting in random walk of particles, and that the mean squared displacement of particles due to Brownian motion is proportional to time. Later, Einstein also established a relationship between the diffusion coefficient of particles to their translational friction by including the discovery from Sir George Stokes ( 1845 ) that suggested that the friction exerted by a moving particle is proportional to its radius and to the viscosity of the solvent surrounding particles (Einstein
1906 ). At the same time, William Sutherland also presented a very similar derivation of the Stokes–Einstein equation independently (Sutherland
1905 ). However, until this point the role of optical anisotropy on angular dependence, intensity, and polarization of scattered light had not been studied. Cabannes and Rocard ( 1929 ) and Gans ( 1921 ;
1923 ) addressed the theory of optically anisotropic scatters as well as their influence on polarisation of scattered light. By this time the Rayleigh–Gans–Debye (RGD) theory was established that included scattering from large particles; however, Zimm’s ( 1945 ;
1948 ) modifications to RGD equations led the foundation of modern light-scattering approaches that are being utilized to determine size, shape, and molecular weight of macromolecules in solution. On the other hand, Leon Brillouin ( 1914 ;
1922 ) proposed formation of two peaks in the frequency distribution of scattered light caused by the scattering of light by phonons (quasi-particles of sound), resulting in two peaks in the Rayleigh (central) line in the frequency spectrum which was later named as the Brillouin doublet. This phenomenon was further evaluated by Gross ( 1930 ) and Landau and Placzek ( 1934 ), which in conjunction with the development of laser optics in the 1960s would revolutionize the light-scattering studies of molecules in liquids. Pecora ( 1964 ) established that the diffusion of macromolecules in solution led to broadening of the frequency profile of scattered light. Pike and co-workers developed the first digital autocorrelator in 1969 and performed experiments on haemocyanin to determine its diffusion coefficient (Foord et al.
1970 ). Thus, the relationship between light scattering and diffusion behaviour of particles was established and experimentally verified, which eventually allowed characterization of molecules in solution using light-scattering methods. These events are briefly summarised in Table
1 . Table 1 Timeline of major events Full size table
Over the years, Pecora, Cummins, Pike and others (Bloomfield and Lim
1978 ; Cummins et al.
1964 ; Fujime
1972 ; Jakeman and Pike
1969 ; Pecora
1972 ; Pike
1972 ) had developed various approaches to determine the diffusion coefficient of molecules in solution, and ultimately their contributions led to the development of the modern dynamic light-scattering (DLS) instrument, with Malvern Instruments (Malvern, UK) commercializing the first modern DLS instruments followed by Brookhaven (Long Island, USA) and ALV (Langen, Germany). Since its inception, DLS has proven particularly popular in determining hydrodynamic behavior of proteins, nucleic acids, and viruses due to its ability to provide information on both size and aggregation. There are already a number of excellent reviews detailing the theory and applications of DLS (Bloomfield
1981 ; Fujime
1972 ; Harding and Jumel
1998 ; Harvey
1973 ; Jamieson et al.
1972 ; Lorber et al.
2012 ; Nieuwenhuysen and Clauwaert
1981 ; Nobbmann et al.
2007 ; Rimai et al.
1970 ; Schurr
1977 ; Serdyuk et al.
2007 ; Van Holde
1970 ; Zakharov and Scheffold
2009 ). Here, our aim is to provide a brief theoretical background, an update on applications of DLS in studying proteins, nucleic acids, and their complexes, and a discussion of the benefits that modern instruments offer. Theoretical considerations When a monochromatic beam of light encounters solution containing macromolecules, light scatters in all directions as a function of the size and shape of the macromolecules. In static light scattering, the intensity of scattered light is analysed as time-averaged intensity, which provides useful information on molecular weight and radius of gyration of macromolecules. On the other hand, if the intensity fluctuations (caused due to Brownian motion of macromolecules in solution) of scattered light is analysed, the diffusion coefficient ( D
τ
) that is related to hydrodynamic size of macromolecules can be obtained. Dynamic light scattering, also known as photon correlation spectroscopy or quasi-elastic light scattering, is a technique that primarily measures the Brownian motion of macromolecules in solution that arises due to bombardment from solvent molecules, and relates this motion to the size (or
D
τ
) of particles. Such motion of macromolecules depends on their size, temperature, and solvent viscosity (Harding and Jumel
1998 ). Therefore, knowledge of accurate temperature is essential for DLS measurements, since the viscosity of solvent depends on the temperature (Harding
1999 ). When the movement of particles over a time range is monitored, information on the size of macromolecules can be obtained, as large particles diffuse slowly, resulting in similar positions at different time points, compared to small particles (such as solvent molecules) which move faster and therefore do not adopt a specific position. In a dynamic light-scattering instrument, when laser light encounters macromolecules the incident light scatters in all directions and scattering intensity is recorded by a detector. The monochromatic incident light will undergo a phenomenon called Doppler broadening as the macromolecules are in continuous motion in solution (Harding and Jumel
1998 ). The scattered light will either result in mutually destructive phases and cancel each other out, or in mutually constructive phases to produce a detectable signal. The digital autocorrelator then correlates intensity fluctuations of scattered light with respect to time (ns-μs) to determine how rapidly the intensity fluctuates, which is related to the diffusion behaviour of macromolecules. In a dynamic light-scattering experiment, we measure the
G
2
( τ ), an intensity correlation function (or second-order correlation function) that describes the motion of macromolecules under investigation and can be expressed as an integral over the product of intensities at time
t
and delayed time ( t
+
τ ) (Berne and Pecora
1976 ): $$ {G}_2\left(\tau \right)=\left\langle I(t)I\left(t+\tau \right)\right\rangle $$
(1)
where, τ is the lag time between the two time-points. The
G
2
( τ ) can be normalised as: $$ {g}_2\left(\tau \right)=\frac{\left\langle I(t)I\left(t+\tau \right)\right\rangle }{{\left\langle I(t)\right\rangle}^2} $$
(2)
The braces in both equations represent averaging of properties over the duration of the experiment (time
t ). In a typical light-scattering experiment, it is not possible to precisely know how each particle moves in solution; however, the motion of particles relative to each other is correlated by means of an electric field correlation function,
G
1
( τ ), also known as the first-order correlation function, which illustrates correlated particle movement and can be defined as: $$ {G}_1\left(\tau \right)=\left\langle E(t)E\left(t+\tau \right)\right\rangle $$
(3)
where,
E ( t ) and
E ( t + τ ) represent the scattered electric fields at times ( t ) and ( t
+
τ ) Similarly to equation  2 , an equation  3
can be normalized as: $$ {g}_1\left(\tau \right)=\frac{\left\langle E(t)E\left(t+\tau \right)\right\rangle }{\left\langle E(t)E(t)\right\rangle } $$
(4)
The
g
1
( τ ) and
g
2
( τ ) can be coupled to each other by the Siegert relation ( 1949 ) based on an approximation that the scattering is
homodyne
(photodetector detects only scattered light) and that the photon counting is a random Gaussian process, $$ {g}_2\left(\tau \right)=B+\beta {\left|{g}_1\left(\tau \right)\right|}^2 $$
(5)
where,
B
is the baseline (∼1) and β is the coherence factor that depends on detector area, optical alignment, and scattering properties of macromolecules. For monodisperse particles, the electric field correlation factor,
g
1
( τ ) decays exponentially and is dependent on a decay constant, Γ, for macromolecules undergoing a Brownian motion. $$ {g}_1\left(\tau \right)={e}^{-\varGamma \tau } $$
(6)
Therefore, equation  5
can be rewritten as: $$ {g}_2\left(\tau \right)=1+\beta {e}^{-2\varGamma \tau } $$
(7)
However, for a polydisperse system,
g
1
( τ ) cannot be represented as a single exponential decay but as an intensity-weighed integral over a distribution of decay rates G(Γ) represented as: $$ {g}_1\left(\tau \right)={\displaystyle \underset{0}{\overset{\infty }{\int }}G\left(\varGamma \right){e}^{-{\varGamma}_{\tau }d\varGamma }} $$
(8)
The decay constant, Γ in equation  6
is directly related to the diffusion behaviour of macromolecules ( D
τ , ) as expressed in the following equation. $$ \varGamma =-{D}_{\tau }{q}^2 $$
(9)
In Equation  9 , the Bragg wave vector
q
is proportional to solvent refractive index
n
(Harding
1999 ). $$ q=\frac{4\pi \eta }{\lambda } sin\left(\theta /2\right) $$
(10)
Where,
λ
is the wavelength of incident light and,
θ
is angle at which the detector is placed. Therefore, equation  7
can be rewritten as: $$ {g}_2\left(\tau \right)=1+\beta {e}^{-2{D}_{\tau }{q}^2\tau } $$
(11)
Thus, equation  11
connects the particle motion with the measured fluctuations (Burchard
1983 ). DLS instruments employ either a detector at 90 ° (e.g., DynaPro ®
NanoStar ®
from Wyatt Technology or Zetasizer Nano S90 ®
from Malvern Instruments) or a backscatter detection system at 173 ° (e.g., Zetasizer Nano S ®
from Malvern Instruments) and at 158 ° (DynaPro Plate Reader ®
from Malvern Instruments) close to the incident light of 180 °. Compared to the detection at 90 °, at a high scattering angle, the contributions of rotational diffusion effects in the observed autocorrelation profiles can be neglected and the
D
τ
can be obtained (Harding
1999 ; Pusey
1972 ). As light does not travel through the entire sample in the cuvette, the backscattering detection system also allows for measurement of the
D
τ
of highly concentrated samples since multiple scattering phenomenon (scattering of a photon by more than one particles in contrast to scattering of a photon by only one particle) of scattered light can be avoided. Furthermore, large dust particles and contaminants scatter more light in the forward direction as their scattering becomes wavelength-independent compared to smaller size particles (Rayleigh scattering) that have nearly equal scattering in both directions, scattering contribution of large particles could be avoided in a backscatter detecting system. As the translational diffusion coefficient,
D
τ
, is concentration-dependent, it should be measured at multiple concentrations and extrapolated to infinite dilution ( D
0
τ
) as a standard practice. Furthermore, the
D
0
τ
can be converted to the standard solvent conditions (viscosity and temperature of water at 20 °C) to obtain
D
0
τ , 20 , w
(Harding and Jumel
1998 ; Raltson
1993 ). The
D
τ
is extremely useful in the determination of other important hydrodynamic parameters. For example, the hydrodynamic radius ( R
h
), which can be defined as the radius of a hypothetical sphere that diffuses at the same rate as particle under investigation, can be obtained using the Stokes–Einstein equation (Pusey
1972 ). $$ {D}_{\tau }=\frac{k_BT}{6\pi \eta {R}_h} $$
(12)
Where
k
B
is Boltzmann coefficient (1.380 × 10 −23
kg.m 2 .s −2 .K −1 ),
T
is an absolute temperature, and
η
is the viscosity of medium. Additionally, the translational frictional coefficient,
f
( F / v , ratio of frictional force
F
experienced by moving particles due to Brownian motion and the velocity
v
of the particle) that provides information on the shape of macromolecules can also be calculated using
D
τ
by the following equation. $$ f=\frac{RT}{N_A{D}_t} $$
(13)
Where
R
is a gas constant (8.314 × 10 −7
erg/mol.K),
T
is an absolute temperature, and
N
A
is Avogadro’s number (6.022137 × 10 23  mol). The frictional coefficient can also be calculated using
R
h
and equation ( 12 ) (Tanford
1961 ). $$ f=6\pi \eta {R}_h $$
(14)
The translational frictional coefficient can be further used along with the
D
τ
to calculate frictional ratio ( f / f
0
, ratio of Stokes radius to that of a sphere with the volume of an unsolvated macromolecule) of macromolecules that can provide information with regard to the solution conformation of macromolecules. For a compact sphere, the frictional ratio is unity and as the shape of macromolecules deviate from compact sphere,
f / f
0
increases. Data analysis Modern instruments are supplied with packages that perform data analysis, using various approaches to primarily evaluate size and homogeneity of macromolecules. In this section, we provide the background in brief on data analysis strategies. The correlation function (equation  11 ) contains information on diffusion behaviour of macromolecules under investigation, which in turn has information on
R
h
(equation  12 ). In order to gain reliable information on diffusion coefficient, primarily two approaches are used to fit the correlation function – monomodal distribution and nonmonomodal distribution methods. Monomodal distribution — cumulant analysis The cumulant analysis method, also known as the method that does not require a priori information, provides mean values of the diffusion coefficient but not the distribution of diffusion coefficients. Therefore, this method is only suitable for Gaussian-like distributions around the mean values. As explained in equation  6 , the electric field correlation factor,
g
1
( τ ) decays exponentially and is dependent on a decay constant, Γ( Γ  = −  D
τ
q
2 ). For a monodisperse system, the
g
1
( τ ) can be treated as a single exponential decay function to calculate the decay constant and hence the diffusion coefficient. However, often the experimental system is polydisperse, which requires the
g
1
( τ ) to be treated as the sum of several exponential decay functions that decays at different rates. The cumulant analysis method was introduced by Koppel ( 1972 ) which became widely popular due to its ease and reliability, and was considered as the method of choice by the International Standards Organisation (ISO) in 1996 and again in 2008 (ISO
2008 ). Other methods including singular value and reconstruction methods were also developed, however, they are not as popular for the data analysis (Finsy et al.
1989 ,
1992 ). Koppel ( 1972 ) derived the cumulative-generating function
K (− τ , Γ) that is related to the logarithm of
g
1
( τ ) and the
m
th
cumulant of distribution function
k
m
(Γ): $$ {k}_m\left(\varGamma \right)=\frac{d^mK{\left(-\tau, \varGamma \right)}^m}{d\left(-\tau \right)}\Big|-\tau =0\kern0.5em \mathrm{where},\kern0.5em K\left(-\tau, \varGamma \right)= ln{g}_1\left(\tau \right) $$
(15)
The
k
m
(Γ) can be rewritten to derive moments about the mean (μ m ): $$ {\mu}_m={\displaystyle \underset{0}{\overset{\infty }{\int }}G\left(\varGamma \right){\left(\varGamma -\overset{-}{\varGamma}\right)}^md\varGamma } $$
(16)
as $$ {k}_1\left(\tau \right)={\displaystyle \underset{0}{\overset{\infty }{\int }}G\left(\varGamma \right)\varGamma d\varGamma =\overset{-}{\varGamma }},\kern0.5em {k}_2\left(\tau \right)={\mu}_2,\kern0.5em {k}_3\left(\tau \right)={\mu}_3,\kern0.5em {k}_4\left(\tau \right)={\mu}_4-3{\mu}_2^2\dots $$
(17)
where,
\( \overline{\varGamma} \)
is the mean of Γ values. Here, based on the Taylor expansion of
K (− τ , Γ) about ( τ ) = 0, the lng 1 ( τ ) (see, equation  15 ) can be rewritten as: $$ K\left(-\tau, \varGamma \right)= ln{g}_1\left(\tau \right)=-\overset{-}{\varGamma}\tau +\frac{k_2}{2!}{\tau}^2-\frac{k_3}{3!}{\tau}^3+\frac{k_4}{4!}{\tau}^4\dots $$
(18)
If we now recall equation  5 , [Siegert relation ( 1949 )] and convert it to a logarithmic mode, we can obtain, $$ ln\left({g}_2\left(\tau \right)-B\right)=ln\beta +2 ln{g}_1\left(\tau \right) $$
(19)
Finally, by combining equations  18
and
19 , we can obtain: $$ ln\left({g}_2\left(\tau \right)-B\right)=ln\beta +2\left(-\overset{-}{\varGamma}\tau +\frac{k_2}{2!}{\tau}^2-\frac{k_3}{3!}{\tau}^3+\frac{k_4}{4!}{\tau}^4\dots \right) $$
(20)
Equation  20
has some useful properties. First of all, the experimentally measured and normalized
g
2
( τ ) could be plotted against ( τ ) to fit the parameters on the right-hand side of the equation. The
\( \overset{-}{\varGamma } \)
( k
1 ),
k
2 ,
k
3
and
k
4
represents average, variance, skewness and kurtosis of measured distributions respectively for the decay rates of the Gaussian distribution. More importantly, the polydispersity index (PDI) could be derived by using
k
2 /
\( {\overset{-}{\varGamma}}^2 \)
relationship. Ideally, parameters above
k
3
are not used to prevent over fitting of the data. It should be noted that often data truncation is required (typically when the autocorrelation function decays ∼ 10 % of the maximum value) because as the signal decays into the baseline, the higher noise could drive signal to negative values which are not useful as the data processing requires mathematical treatment of data such as square root and logarithm. Also, random errors lead to huge variations fitting of cumulants. For example, with the highly sophisticated instruments, random errors in
\( \overset{-}{\varGamma } \)
could be as low as 1 % but for
k
2
it could be as high as 20 %. Therefore, the high-order cumulants are not recommended to be used (Koppel
1972 ). Non-monomodal distribution methods Unlike the cumulant analysis, non-monomodal methods do not assume a certain type of distribution of diffusion properties, and are more suitable for polydisperse systems. The
non-negative least squares
(NNLS) method was developed by Morrison et al. ( 1985 ) for broad monomodal or multimodal distributions, which involves non-negativity constraints and the geometrical spacing of the distribution based on the Laplace transform of equation  8 . The NNLS method uses decay constants
\( \overset{-}{\varGamma } \)
representing decay rates
G (Γ) spaced in a linear or logarithmic form over a chosen ranges of Γ. For Γ
i
, the
b
i
coefficients can be obtained from the best fit to the data with in the NNLS constraints using following equation. $$ {\chi}^2={\displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^N{\left[{g}_1\left({\tau}_j\right)-{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^M{b}_i{e}^{\left(-{\varGamma}_i{\tau}_j\right)}}\right]}^2} $$
(21)
Where
N
is the number of data points and
M
is the number of decay constants with the constraint that Γ
i
, and
b
i
are zero or positive values (Hassan and Kulshreshtha
2006 ). The main drawback of NNLS is its sensitivity to small variations in measurements (of both, data and errors). To address this issue, the maximum-entropy (Livesey et al.
1986 ) method was developed, which was subsequently modified to include geometrical spacing (Nyeo and Chu
1989 ). Another inversion method that utilizes restraints to specify the range and values of a set of Γ
i
, before data processing, to obtain a unique set of parameters for a reliable fit, is known as the
exponential sampling
method where, Γ
i
values are exponentially spaced (Ostrowsky et al.
1981 ): $$ {\varGamma}_{i+1}={\varGamma}_i{e}^{\left(\eta \pi /{\omega}_{max}\right)} $$
(22)
where,
ω
max
is the maximum possible value of
ω
determined by the experimental noise that does not involve negative values for
b
i
in equation  21 . It is calculated through a trial and error method by gradually increasing
ω
until negative values for the distribution coefficients are obtained. Since each Γ is related to the
R
h
(equations  9 ,
10
and
12 ), a frequency histogram of the radius distribution can be obtained using this method. The
constrained regularization method for inverting data
(CONTIN) that also involves Laplase transform was developed by Provencher ( 1982a ;
1982b ; with Stepanek
1996 ) and is one of the most popular data analysis methods that does not involve sequential optimization of
ω
max
like the
exponential sampling
method. The CONTIN technique uses a modified version of NNLS equation that includes minimization of
regularised
residuals (unlike minimization of residuals in the NNLS equation) and an appropriate weighing function. Therefore, a modified expression of equation  21
can be written as: $$ {\chi}^2={\displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^N\left(1/{\sigma}_i^2\right)}{\left[{g}_1\left({\tau}_j\right)-{\displaystyle \int G\left(\varGamma \right)}{e}^{\left(-\varGamma \tau \right)}d\varGamma \right]}^2+{\alpha}^2{\left\Vert LG\left(\varGamma \right)\right\Vert}^2 $$
(23)
Here,
α
is a regularizer that adds an additional constraint on the solution while performing data analysis, whereas
L
is the operator of regularizer. The CONTIN method employs a nonlinear statistical technique to smooth the solution, a regularizer parameter based on the
F -test and a parsimony principle that chooses distribution function with the least detailed distribution that agrees with the data, resulting in narrower distributions. The major discoveries in data analysis are briefly summarised in Table
1 . Although the DLS measures the PDI (cumulant analysis,
k
2 /
\( {\overset{-}{\varGamma}}^2 \) , Equation
20 ), it should not be compared with the PDI measured by the static light-scattering method (ratio of weight–average molar mass to number–average molar mass,
M
w
/ M
n
) as based on the
k
2 /
\( {\overset{-}{\varGamma}}^2 \)
ratio, PDI from DLS is in the range of 0–1, where in theory, a value of zero represents a monodisperse system, whereas that for
M
w
/ M
n
would be ∼1. Typically, the cumulant analysis method is suitable for samples with the PDI of ∼0.1, i.e., monodisperse system. The PDI value of 0.1 to 0.7 represents nearly monodisperse preparation, whereas PDI >0.7 suggests broad distribution of macromolecular sizes in solution and non-monomodal distribution methods should be considered for data analysis. PDI of < 0.05 is rarely observed in biological systems. Size distribution of hydrodynamic radius The methods described in sections 3.1 and 3.2 will provide distribution of diffusion behaviour, and hence the distribution of
R
h
. The averaged diffusion coefficient (< D
τ
>) in a given system can be expressed as: $$ \left\langle {D}_{\tau}\right\rangle =\frac{{\displaystyle {\sum}_i{N}_i{M}_{w,i}^2P\left(q,R\right){D}_{\tau i}}}{{\displaystyle {\sum}_i{N}_i{M}_{w,i}^2P\left(q,R\right)}} $$
(24)
where
M
w
is the molecular weight of
N
number of particles, and
P ( q , R ) is the intraparticle interface. Equation  24
describes the dependence of the diffusion coefficient on
M
w
2 , which explains that the technique is inherently biased for molecules with higher molecular weights. It should also be noted that the scattering of light depends on the refractive index of macromolecules, and that the term
P ( q , R ) can be approximated to 1 for molecules sufficiently smaller than the wavelength of the incident light, resulting in
z -averaged
D
τ
. Since it is the intensity fluctuations of macromolecules that are being collected and analysed in a DLS experiment, the first-hand information on
R
h
is based on the
intensity-weighted distribution
or simply,
intensity distribution
that provides
z -average
R
h
. As light scattering depends on the refractive index of macromolecules and solvent viscosity, the
z -averaged
R
h
requires input of these two properties. According to the Rayleigh approximation, the intensity distribution is approximately proportional to (size) 6
for small particles (Barnett
1942 ), as presented in equation  25 . It should be noted that the
z -averaged
R
h
from DLS should only be compared with
R
h
from other methods if the molecules under investigation are monodisperse and display monomodal distribution, particles are spherical in shape, and are solubilized in suitable buffer system, as the intensity distribution depends on the refractive index of molecules and viscosity of the medium. $$ \%{I}_a=\frac{a^6{N}_{a\cdot }100}{N_a{a}^6+{N}_b{b}^6} $$
(25)
Equation  25
describes intensity distribution for a solution containing
N
a
and
N
b
molecules with size
a
and
b
respectively. The % I
a
presents intensity-weighted distribution for particles with size
a , based on the relative amount of intensity of molecules with size
a
(Malvern
2014 ). The
intensity-weighted distribution
can be converted to
volume-weighted distribution
that represents relative proportion of multiple sizes in a particular sample based on their volume or size but not their intensity, by taking advantage of the Mie theory. According to the Rayleigh approximation, the mass of spherical molecules is proportional to (size) 3 . If the density of a system is uniform, mass can be approximated to the volume, implying that the volume-weighted distribution is proportional to (size) 3 , which is why the
R
h
from volume distribution is smaller compared to
intensity-weighted distribution . $$ \%{V}_a=\frac{a^3{N}_{a\cdot }100}{N_a{a}^3+{N}_b{b}^3} $$
(26)
Equation  26
describes volume distribution for a solution containing
N
a
and
N
b
molecules with size
a
and
b
respectively. The % V
a
presents volume-weighted distribution for molecules with size
a , based on the volume of molecules with size
a . In addition to the knowledge of refractive index and viscosity, volume distribution relies on the assumption that all the molecules are homogenous and spherical in shape, and that the intensity distribution has no errors. Because volume distribution presents distribution of sizes based on volume/mass of molecules, it is practically more useful. The intensity-weighted distributions can also be converted to
number-weighted distributions
that represent number of molecules in each bin in a given histogram. Equation  27
presents number distribution for a system containing two molecules. $$ \%{N}_a=\frac{N_{a\cdot }100}{N_a+{N}_b} $$

a . Standard operating protocol We have used a Zetasizer Nano S from Malvern Instruments Ltd. to perform all the experiments described here with low-volume quartz cuvette ZEN2112 from Hellma Analytics. However, the approach could be modified to suit any equivalent modern DLS instrument. Cuvette cleaning For efficient cleaning, it is recommended to use a dedicated cuvette washer (e.g., C1295 from Sigma–Aldrich).
Wash cuvette with approximately 5 ml of 5 % solution of Hellmanex TM
from Hellma Analytics or similar detergent solution.
Wash cuvette with approximately 5 ml of 5 % acetic acid solution (ACS grade).
Wash cuvette with approximately 10 ml of ultrapure water (e.g., Type 1 quality water from Milipore Milli-Q systems).
Dry cuvette with approximately 5 ml of 70 % ethanol. Keep cuvette for additional 5 minutes on the cuvette washer to allow sufficient drying.
Dust particles scatter light that may affect the DLS measurements. A standard check is then performed to ensure sufficient cleaning using only filtered buffer in the cuvette, where an error (e.g., insufficient counts to obtain reliable results) results indicating that the cuvette is clean and contains no particles that can interfere with measurements.
Analysing biomolecular preparations to detect aggregation We refer to preparations containing proteins, glycoproteins, nucleic acids (RNA, DNA), protein–protein complexes (PPC) or protein–nucleic acids complexes (PNC) as biomolecular preparations. It is important to note that samples subjected to DLS analysis are “polished samples” and not “crude preparations” meaning that the proteins, nucleic acids, or their complexes have been already purified by means of various forms of chromatography [e.g., affinity chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, and/or size exclusion chromatography (SEC)] to achieve a high level of purity. One of the most important criteria in biomedical sciences is ensuring that the biomolecular preparation is devoid of high molecular weight aggregates (HMWA), as aggregation can be a major rate-limiting factor in biochemical, biophysical, and biopharmaceutical studies. For example, an aggregated and/or inhomogeneous sample will be difficult to crystallise — an essential step to obtain a high-resolution structure by X-ray crystallography. Several biophysical techniques such as small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and small angel neutron scattering (SANS) can only provide reliable information for monodisperse and homogenous preparations, as molecules with higher molecular weight (albeit at extremely low concentration) will scatter heavily thereby affecting the outcomes of these experiments. As a practical commercial example, therapeutic antibodies need to go through a rigorous analysis that involves investigation of their aggregation state (amongst other properties including temperature, storage stability, and degradation) before the selection of a lead antibody candidate for therapeutic applications. The following is a standard protocol the authors use in their laboratory for analysis of proteins, antibodies, glycoproteins, nucleic acids, and their complexes for structure biology applications.
Clean cuvette as described in subsection “Monomodal distribution — cumulant analysis”.
Filter the sample through 0.1 μm filter (e.g., Ultrafree-MC VV Centrifugal Filter, Merck Millipore) to remove large particulates from the preparation.
It is critical to study aggregation state at the working concentrations (concentrations at which the downstream study is planned, e.g., crystallization or antibody dose). Prior to all measurements, concentration for polished sample should be accurately measured.
Often, biological samples are precious since they require time and resources. To minimise the sample requirement, we use a cuvette that requires only ∼12 μl of filtered concentrated sample. However, to avoid air bubbles we load ∼20 μl of sample carefully by reaching the bottom of the cuvette with a straight pipette tip.
The software package that accompanies modern DLS instruments (such as the Zetasizer Nano S software) enables creation of a standard operating protocol (SOP) for an individual sample. We recommend that for each particular sample, a SOP should be prepared that contains essential information such as the buffer composition and experimental temperature (that in turn will calculate the viscosity at particular temperature and refractive index of buffer: essential parameters for reliable DLS measurements).
Perform the
R
h
distribution measurements at least five times to obtain reproducible results at high concentration. In order to study the concentration dependence of
R
h
, we dilute the preparation by directly adding filtered buffer into the cuvette containing a high concentration of sample followed by gentle mixing using pipette and collect data. We continue this practice for multiple concentrations.
Often, we use well-characterised proteins such as BSA or ovalbumin as positive controls to ensure that the instrument is performing as expected. In addition, several NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) standards such as 60 nm or 100 nm polystyrene latex spheres should also be used to ensure proper instrument function. The Zetasizer software provides a number of analysis methods to study aggregation by DLS. Size Distribution by Intensity and Size Distribution by Volume are the most widely used methods, whose theories are discussed in the “ Data analysis ” section, and usefulness in practice is discussed in the next sections. The choice of the analysis method will depend on the objective of study. For example, if an analysis is aimed to study the presence of trace amount of aggregates for lead therapeutic antibody preparation (to achieve aggregation-free preparation), the intensity distribution method is more suitable, as high molecular weight aggregates will disproportionately scatter light relative to smaller particles enabling detection despite their relatively low concentration in the sample. On the other hand, if the study is aimed to investigate homogeneity to set-up crystallization trials or for additional biochemical/biophysical characterisation using analytical ultracentrifuge, SAXS, etc., purity around 95 % is acceptable and the volume distribution method can be used. Applications The dynamic light-scattering technique has a number of advantages over other methods. For example, it is possible to conduct experiments with wide range of sample buffer and wide range of temperature as well as concentrations. DLS is also a non-invasive technique that requires comparatively low amounts of sample and provides reliable estimates of the quality of preparation rapidly. In the following sections, we describe applications of DLS to study homogeneity of proteins, RNA, and their complexes. Detecting aggregation of recombinant proteins Probing homogeneity of biomolecular preparations is required for various types of downstream experiments and applications. This section focuses on study of a multi-domain extracellular matrix protein (ECM), nidogen-1 (ND-1), and a well-studied globular protein, ovalbumin. ND-1 (139 kDa) is a key basement membrane protein that primarily interacts with other ECM proteins such as laminin, perlecan, fibulin, and fibronectin (Gerl et al.
1991 ; Hsieh et al.
1994 ; Mayer et al.
1993 ; Sasaki et al.
1995a ,
b ). It is a very difficult system to study, as it undergoes proteolytic degradation as well as aggregation. In order to investigate its low-resolution structure, we required a homogenous preparation devoid of both degradation and aggregation. Initial expression and purification trials produced heterogeneous preparations as presented in Fig.  1a
and
b ; however, subsequent optimization achieved high quality preparations without significant degradation and with less than 5 % of HMWA as detected by intensity distributions (Fig.  1c ). It is important to note that in Rayleigh scattering, the scattering intensity depends on the 6th power of the size of molecules (Barnett
1942 ), and therefore despite being present in negligible amounts, the HMWA
R
h
peak intensity is disproportionately represented relative to the dominant smaller molecular weight monodisperse species in the same preparation. Therefore, the HMWA peak is absent in the volume distribution (Fig.  1d ). This example clearly highlights DLS as a sensitive tool to screen for even trace amounts of HMWA in biomolecule preparations. Fig. 1 Evaluating homogeneity of protein solution.

Hydrodynamic radius distribution by intensity for nidogen-1 (ND-1) at 0.4 mg/ml, indicating that although there is a major peak for each measurement, there are multiple peaks visible between 15 nm and 500 nm ( x -axis) suggesting the presence of high molecular weight aggregated species. Degradation at 4 nm is also visible for one of the measurements in
red
colour.
b
Hydrodynamic radius distribution by volume derived from intensity profiles for ND-1 at 0.4 mg/ml concentration, suggesting that volume distribution is not sensitive enough for detecting scant amount of aggregation. However, peaks from multiple runs do not coincide with each other: that essentially is a reflection of heterogeneous sample. Again, the degradation is visible for the measurement that is clearly visible for intensity distribution.

Similar to
a , the aggregation studies for ND-1 were performed at 0.5 mg/m for a preparation optimized to obtain cleaner sample, indicating that compared to
a , the level of aggregation is severely reduced.
d

Recombinant ND-1 (139 kDa) was expressed into 293-EBNA cells and purified using affinity chromatography, followed by SEC in 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCl buffer as described earlier (Patel et al.
2014 ) Full size image
Figure
2a
presents an intensity distribution profile for ovalbumin (44 kDa) at multiple concentrations, where HMWA (>100 nm) are visible for each concentration. However, the volume distribution profiles derived from the intensity information for each concentration display a single peak, since the amount of aggregates is negligible (Fig.  2b ). As a volume distribution profile represents the relative volume of high and low molecular weight species in a preparation (discussed in section 3.3), we will mainly focus on the volume distribution profiles in subsequent sections. Ideally, to report
R
h
value, it should be first measured multiple times at each individual concentration followed by calculating mean
R
h
value at each concentration and plotting against concentration to eliminate concentration effects, similar to the approach taken with diffusion and sedimentation coefficient measurements. We have provided an example here with ovalbumin (Fig.  2c ), a practice that is routinely followed in our approach for proteins and nucleic acids as well as PPC and PNC to obtain a reliable estimate of
R
h
. In addition to ovalbumin, we also evaluated routinely used molecular weight standards that are globular in shape at a single concentration to evaluate resolution of DLS measurements (Table
2 ). Fig.  2d

distribution at multiples concentrations for ovalbumin. The intensity distributions ( a ) suggest presence of ∼5 % aggregated material at 100 nm and above. Those peaks are not present in volume distribution profiles ( b ) since the amount of aggregated material is negligible. However, since large molecules scatter light more strongly, even a trace amount of aggregation can be detected using intensity distribution. In both cases, nearly identical positions of peak suggest a homogenous preparation. For biophysical and structure biology applications, such preparations are acceptable; however, for therapeutic antibodies, further optimization may be required.

Hydrodynamic radius for frequently used molecular weight standards to calibrate size exclusion column was measured at single concentration. The details for molecular weights and concentrations are provided in Table  2 . Note that all of the proteins used here are globular proteins; therefore, it is possible to compare their

profiles in terms of molecular weight. The smallest protein here is aprotinin ( Mw
6.5 kDa) with

2011 ). The molecular weight standards kit was purchased from GE healthcare, and DLS data were collected in 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl buffer Full size image

Protein–protein interaction studies In addition to detection of aggregation in biomolecular preparations, DLS can also be employed to study PPC. Ideally, the SEC-purified proteins are first studied by DLS alone, followed by analysis of the complex by DLS after SEC purification. An example of PPC studies using DLS is provided in Fig.  3a and b , which presents DLS data for ND-1 (139 kDa), LM
γ −1 (109 kDa), and their complex. LM
γ −1, an interacting partner of ND-1 and Net4, plays crucial roles in basement membrane formation (Breitkreutz et al.
2004 ; Schneiders et al.
2007 ) cell migration, and metastasis (Kuratomi et al.
2002 ). Single nucleotide polymorphisms in LM
γ −1 gene is linked with premature ovarian failure (Pyun et al.
2012 ). Figure
3a
presents the
R
h
distribution data for SEC purified ND-1 and LM
γ −1 proteins at single concentration. After studying how individual proteins behave at multiple concentrations in terms of their homogeneity by DLS, we also investigated their complex using DLS (Fig.  3a ). The
R
h
distribution studied at multiple concentrations suggested that both proteins are highly monodisperse in solution, with
R
h
of 6.80 ± 0.10 nm and 6.40 ± 0.05 nm respectively (Fig.  3b ). Furthermore, the complex of ND-1 - LM
γ −1 was also found to be monodisperse with
R
h
of 9.00 ± 0.04 nm (Fig.  3b ). This example clearly demonstrates the strengths of DLS technique — very rapid measurements and requiring low amounts of purified components to study protein–protein interactions. Fig. 3 Homogeneity of protein-protein complexes.

Complex of ND-1-LM γ-1 was purified using SEC, and DLS measurements were performed in 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCl buffer as described earlier (Patel et al.

Homogeneity of viral RNA molecules RNA molecules are highly labile, since exposure to trace amounts of ribonuclease impurities present in aqueous solutions and reagents, air and dust particles, as well as direct human skin contact with RNA preparations, can result in RNA degradation. Our dynamic light-scattering instrument is regularly used to study homogeneity of in-vitro transcribed RNA. The West Nile virus genome terminal regions (5’ and 3’) are recognised by an enzyme called 2’ 5’ oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), which is a part of an innate immune system. Once viral RNA is recognised, OAS1 synthesises 2’-5’-linked oligoadenylates that ultimately stimulate RNase L in order to slow viral propagation (Hovanessian and Justesen
2007 ). We studied interactions of the 5’ terminal region (5’ TR) with OAS1 as well as 3’ terminal region (3’ TR) using a variety of biochemical and biophysical tools, one of which was DLS. While interpreting DLS data for RNA molecules, it should be noted that the folded RNA structures are typically extended; therefore, the
R
h
of RNA is often observed to be higher compared to a globular protein of similar molecular weight. This effect has been observed qualitatively by SEC (Kim et al.
2007 ). Figures  4a
and
b
present a monodisperse preparation of the West Nile virus 5’ TR based on intensity and volume distributions respectively at 3.5 mg/ml, whereas Fig.  4c
and
d
presents intensity and volume distributions for 3’ TR from West Nile virus at 2.7 mg/ml. Both distributions for each sample suggest that the 5’ TR and 3’ TR RNA are free of any aggregation and suitable for low-resolution shape determination using SAXS. The DLS data for 5’ TR (47.5 kDa) and 3’ TR (37.5 kDa) were calculated at multiple concentrations to obtain
R
h
of 5.1 ± 0.02 nm and 3.46 ± 0.06 nm respectively compared to ovalbumin, a globular protein with
M
w
of 44 kDa that has
R
h
of ∼3 nm, suggesting that both of these RNA has an extended structure in solution, which was later confirmed by low-resolution solution scattering studies (Deo et al.
2014 ,
2015 ). These examples clearly establish DLS as an ideal method to study homogeneity and conformation of RNA molecules prepared in laboratory using in-vitro transcription. Fig. 4 Evaluating homogeneity of viral RNA preparations. Multiple measurements for intensity distribution ( a ) and volume distribution ( b ) at 3.5 mg/ml suggest that the 5’ TR RNA is highly pure and devoid of any aggregation. Similarly, 3’ untranslated region (3’ TR) from West Nile virus was also studied using DLS at 2.7 mg/ml, where
a
and
b
present intensity and volume distributions suggesting presence of a homogenous solution of 3’ TR. The 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions (5’ TR — 47.5 kDa, 3’ TR — 37.5 kDa) from West Nile virus were prepared using an in-vitro transcription method followed by purification using SEC and DLS analysis in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.0), 100 mM NaCl buffer as described earlier (Deo et al.
2014 ,
2015 ) Full size image
Protein–RNA interaction studies As with PPC studies, protein–RNA complexes can also be studied using DLS. We have used DLS to characterise OAS1–RNA complex and PKR–RNA complexes. In order to study the homogeneity of complexes, it is ideal to simultaneously study individual components. Therefore, host OAS1 (41 kDa) protein, 5’ TR RNA as well as 3’ TR RNA from West Nile virus were studied at multiple concentrations. As mentioned above, Fig.  4
displays homogeneity of 5’ TR and 3’ TR, whereas Fig.  5a
presents DLS data for OAS1 demonstrating monodispersity of OAS1. Additionally, the purity of 5’ TR-OAS1 complex and 3’ TR-OAS1 complex is also evident from Fig.  5a . The complexes (5’ TR–OAS1 and 3’ TR–OAS1) were also studied at multiple concentrations, similarly to OAS1, 5’ TR, and 3’ TR. The DLS data for individual components and complex suggest that all the species are highly pure in solution. The
R
h
values obtained from multiple concentrations are: OAS1 (3.30 ± 0.3 nm), 5’ TR (5.10 ± 0.2 nm), 3’ TR (3.36 ± 0.06 nm), 5’ TR–OAS1 (4.92 ± 0.07) and 3’ TR–OAS1 (5.45 ± 0.03). OAS1 is a globular-shaped protein (Deo et al.
2014 ; Donovan et al.
2013 ), whereas both RNA molecules were found to be extended in solution. Isothermal titration calorimetry studies for both complexes established 1:1 ration of individual species (Deo et al.
2014 ,
2015 ); therefore, a decrease of
R
h
for 5’ TR–OAS1 complex and an increase of
R
h
in 3’ TR–OAS1 complex clearly indicate conformational change in RNA molecules. Overall, both examples suggest that DLS, in conjunction with other methods, can be employed to study conformational changes mediated by interacting partners in solution. Fig. 5 Homogeneity of protein-RNA complexes.

Dynamic light scattering data for PKR 1–169 , VA I ∆TS, and VA I ∆TS–PKR 1–169
complex are presented at multiple concentrations. Human OAS1 (41 kDa) was expressed in BL21(DE3) cells followed by purification by means of affinity and SEC (Meng et al.
2012 ). DLS data were measured in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT buffer (Deo et al.
2014 ). The 5’ TR–OAS1 and 3’–TR OAS1 complexes were purified using SEC and analysed using DLS in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 40 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA (Deo et al.
2015 ). Similarly, the adenovirus VA I
RNA lacking the terminal stem-loop RNA (VA I ∆TS, 32.3 kDa) was prepared by in-vitro transcription method followed by purification using SEC (Dzananovic et al.
2014 ), whereas human protein kinase R (PKR) lacking the C-terminal kinase domain (PKR 1–169
18.8 kDa) was expressed into BL21(DE3) cells, purified by means of affinity and SEC followed by DLS data collection in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.50), 100 mM NaCl, and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Dzananovic et al.
2013 ). DLS data for SEC purified VAI∆TS–PKR 1–169
complex was collected in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.50), 100 mM NaCl buffer (Dzananovic et al.

PKR is a major player of innate immunity providing support against viral infection by recognising viral double-stranded RNA, and ultimately influences a number of cellular activities (Garcia et al.
2006 ). It is composed of two double-stranded RNA binding motifs (dsRBM) connected by a flexible linker as well as a kinase domain that is linked to dsRBMs by a linker (Dzananovic et al.
2014 ; McKenna et al.
2007 ). In order to study the low-resolution structure of double-stranded RNA binding domain of PKR (PKR 1–169 , 18.8 kDa) in complex with adenovirus VA I
RNA that lacks the terminal region (VA I ∆TS, 32.2 kDa), DLS was employed as a tool to study homogeneity of PKR 1–169 , VA I ∆TS and their complex. The homogeneity of each species and the complex is evident from Fig.  5c , that essentially has a single peak for each sample without any HMWA. The DLS data were collected at multiple concentrations and extrapolated to infinite dilution to obtain
R
h
of 2.80 ± 0.10 nm for PKR 1–169 , 3.30 ± 0.04 nm for VA I ∆TS and 3.90 ± 0.2 nm for their complex (Dzananovic et al.
2014 ). This example suggests that as above, DLS can be a powerful tool to study homogeneity of proteins, RNA, and their complexes. As described in Section 5.6, these
R
h
values can also used to validate low-resolution structures or individual components and complexes. Protein–small molecules interactions Agrin is a heparin sulphate proteoglycan located in the extracellular matrix, and plays a crucial role in aggregation of neuromuscular junction (Nitkin et al.
1987 ) and formation of synapses (Hilgenberg et al.
2006 ; Hoover et al.
2003 ; Khan et al.
2001 ). It is composed of an N-terminal domain (NtA), a series of follistatin-like domains (FS), and three laminin G-like C-terminal domains (G1, G2, and G3) (Mascarenhas et al.
2003 ; Stetefeld et al.
2001 ). The C-terminal G3 domain of agrin is known to interact with calcium if the alternative amino-acid splicing site has eight amino-acid inserts present (Stetefeld et al.
2004 ). However, we attempted to investigate if the G3 domain without any amino acid present at the splice site can interact with divalent cations. It should be noted that the G3 domain was expressed as a fusion protein that contains Fc domain of human IgG (G 3 B 0 Fc), which facilitates purification by means of protein A affinity chromatography. For each measurement, 20 μl of G 3 B 0 Fc (∼1 mg/ml) protein was added to a clean cuvette and allowed to equilibrate to 20 °C for 5 minutes followed by measurement of
R
h
. As presented in Fig.  6
for each set of experiments, an
R
h
of ∼ 5 nm was observed for G 3 B 0 Fc that corresponds to a monomer as deduced from AUC and DLS experiments (Patel et al.
2011 ). After measuring the
R
h
for G 3 B 0 F c
protein, CaCl 2
was added into the cuvette to final concentration of 5 mM followed by temperature equilibrium/incubation for 5 minutes prior to measurement of
R
h
to determine effect of CaCl 2
on protein. The procedure was repeated to increase CaCl 2
concentration up to 50 mM. Figure
6a
demonstrates the effect of CaCl 2 , where addition of 5 mM CaCl 2
led to formation of a supramolecular complex of G 3 B 0 Fc yielding two peaks (major peak ∼ 600 nm) that increased to ∼ 800 nm when CaCl 2
concentration was increased to 50 mM. Since EDTA binds to divalent cations, we then added EDTA to final concentration of 5 mM into the cuvette containing G 3 B 0 Fc protein with 50 mM CaCl 2 . After 5 minutes of temperature equilibrium of sample, the DLS measurements were performed, which yielded a peak at ∼ 5 nm for G 3 B 0 Fc that is nearly identical to the first measurement where CaCl 2
was absent. Similarly, experiments were performed to study effect of MnCl 2
and ZnCl 2
where the
R
h
for G 3 B 0 Fc was measured first followed by addition to MnCl 2
or ZnCl 2
to final concentration of only 2 mM, which resulted into supramolecular complex with peak ∼ 900 nm which could be reduced to the original size of G 3 B 0 Fc upon addition of EDTA to final concentration of 5 mM, as presented in Fig.  6b
and
c . We also performed similar experiments with MgCl 2 ; however, only marginal increase in
R
h
for G 3 B 0 Fc was observed at 50 mM MgCl 2
concentration (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the G 3
domain of agrin can interact with metal ions resulting into reversible aggregates of various sizes depending on the metal ion. However, if such behaviour of G 3
domain of agrin in vitro has any biological relevance remains to be demonstrated. It could be argued that the presence of Fc domain may influence such behaviour of agrin G 3
protein; however, we were unable to find such effect of cations on antibodies in the literature. Nevertheless, our data shows that it is possible to study aggregation of macromolecules induced by small molecules using DLS. Fig. 6 Protein–small molecules interaction studies. The mouse G 3 B 0
protein fused with human Fc domain of IgG–G 3 B 0 Fc was studied using DLS at 1 mg/ml.

a
A single peak for G 3 B 0 Fc appears at ∼5 nm which resolves into two peaks at ∼ 100 nm and ∼ 600 nm upon addition of 5 mM CaCl 2 . The higher molecular weight peak further increases up to ∼ 700 nm in the presence of 50 mM CaCl 2 . However, addition of EDTA (5 mM) reduces the huge complex of G 3 B 0 Fc–50 mM CaCl2 to ∼ 5 nm that essentially overlays on G 3 B 0 Fc data. Similarly, addition of only 2 mM MnCl 2
( b ) and 2 mM ZnCl 2
( c ) increases the size of G 3 B 0 Fc from ∼ 5 nm to ∼900 nm, indicating presence of a very heavy aggregate. Addition of EDTA (5 mM in both cases) again reduces the heavy complex to monomeric size of G 3 B 0 Fc. The C-terminal laminin G-like G 3
domain variant of chicken agrin without insert of amino acids at the alternative splice site B (B 0 ), G 3 B 0
was expressed as a fusion protein, with human Fc domain of IgG–G 3 B 0 Fc being expressed using HEK293 cells as described previously (Patel et al.
2011 ). The G 3 B 0 Fc protein was affinity purified, followed by DLS data collection in 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl at pH 7.2 Full size image
Complementary hydrodynamic methods enhanced by DLS measurements Apart from providing information on homogeneity, DLS can also be employed as a complementary method to study size and shape of macromolecules. In this section, we will provide a brief outline of applications of DLS as a complementary method. Molecular weight determination Molecular weight is one of the most important properties of any molecule. Comparison of sequence molecular weight of proteins or nucleic acids with experimentally determined molecular weight can provide useful information such as their oligomeric status, degradation, or change in molecular weight upon interaction between binding partners. There are a number of methods that can provide molecular weight information. For example, SEC can, in theory provide molecular weight for proteins, nucleic acids, or complexes. However, the molecular weight calculated from SEC relies on the assumption that the molecular weight standard and biomolecules being studied adopt a spherical shape; deviations in shape typically result in overestimates of molecular weight from elongated structures. A more reliable method for calculating molecular weight is to combine sedimentation coefficient data from an analytical ultracentrifuge and
R
h
from the dynamic light scattering using the Svedberg equation (Svedberg and Pedersen
1940 ), $$ {M}_w=\frac{6\pi {\eta}_0{R}_h{N}_A{s}_{20,w}^0}{1-\overset{-}{v{\rho}_0}} $$
(28)
where,
\( \overset{-}{v} \)
is the partial specific volume,
η
o
is the solvent viscosity and
ρ
o
is the solvent density. Previously, we have used such an approach to determine molecular weights of proteins — laminin γ-1 arm, G 3
domain of agrin fused with human IgG Fc, N-terminal domain of RHAU, and OAS1, as well as VA I
RNA (Deo et al.
2014 ; Dzananovic et al.
2014 ; Meier et al.
2013 ; Patel et al.
2010 ,
2011 ). Thus,
R
h
information from DLS can be a very useful parameter when combined with the sedimentation coefficient to obtain molecular weight information. Homogeneity studies of biological samples exposed to high-energy X-rays SAXS is a type of static light-scattering technique that utilizes X-rays to allow determination of low-resolution shape of macromolecules in solution. SAXS data can either be collected at the synchrotron using high-energy X-rays or from in-house sources where the X-rays source is much weaker. Typically, in-house SAXS data collection (∼20 °C) requires 2–4 hours of sample exposure time to X-rays, compared to the synchrotron source that requires only a few seconds. Furthermore, while collecting SAXS data, the user normally collects data for multiple samples in a single experimental setup starting from buffer, meaning that it could take over 10 hours for some samples. Therefore, samples susceptible to either storage at ∼20 °C for extended periods or radiation damage may alter the homogenous preparation of macromolecules to degraded and/or aggregated states. We routinely use DLS to determine sample homogeneity of samples after SAXS data collection of protein, RNA, and their complexes (Deo et al.
2014 ,
2015 ; Dzananovic et al.
2013 ,
2014 ; Meier et al.
2013 ; Patel et al.
2014 ). Furthermore, DLS measurements are an extremely useful independent crosscheck used to validate ab-initio shape reconstruction of macromolecules using SAXS data, a heavily computational process. To validate SAXS models without any bias, we calculate hydrodynamic parameters including
R
h
and sedimentation coefficient from the models using program HYDROPRO (Ortega et al.
2011b ), and compare them to experimentally determined properties by DLS and complementary hydrodynamic techniques. It is also possible to study DNA and polysaccharides using packages in the HYDRO family (Amoros et al.
2011 ; Benitez et al.
2015 ). We have followed such practice for proteins, RNA, DNA, and their complexes (Ariyo et al.
2015 ; Deo et al.
2014 ,
2015 ; Dzananovic et al.
2013 ,
2014 ; Meier et al.
2013 ; Patel et al.
2010 ,
2011 ,
2012 ,
2014 ; Vadlamani et al.
2015 ). Shape analysis in combination with radius of gyration The radius of gyration ( R
g
) parameter, defined as an average root mean squared distance from the centre of the mass of a macromolecule, can be obtained using static light-scattering studies where the intensity of scattered light is analysed. For proteins and nucleic acids, SAXS or SANS methods are employed to measure
R
g
. The ratio of
R
g
to
R
h
could provide indication of conformation of macromolecules in solution. For globular proteins the ration is ∼ 0.70, and it increases as the shape changes from globular to extended rigid particles (Burchard
1992 ). Table
3
summarises the
R
g
and
R
h
values of some of the proteins and RNA we have studied previously, with their
R
g
/ R
h
ratios. We have used SAXS data to construct low-resolution structures of these macromolecules, which essentially validated our preliminary shape information of these macromolecules. Thus, the DLS can be used in conjunction with static light scattering to deduce shape information. Table 3 Combination of radius of gyration and hydrodynamic radius provides shape information Full size table
In order to obtain more reliable and unbiased information on shape (flexible coil, rods, cylinders, spheres) of macromolecules (DNA, RNA, polysaccharides, proteins, and viruses), Garcia de la Torre and colleagues (Amoros et al.
2011 ; Ortega and Garcia de la Torre
2007 ) developed a different concept where instead of using
R
h
and
R
g
as well as their ratios, a variation of those properties and their ratios were implemented. For example, instead of using
R
h
or
D
τ
, equivalent radii, T that is related to diffusion properties (T =  f /6 πη
0
) can be used. Similarly, for
R
g
, equivalent radii,
G
( \( \sqrt{5/3}{R}_g \) ) can be used, which in turn could be utilised to obtain G/T, which is a very useful ratio indicating solution conformation of macromolecules (Ortega et al.
2011a ; Ortega and Garcia de la Torre
2007 ). Typically, the ration of G/T is ∼1 for spherical particles and >1 for elongated macromolecules (Table
3 ). Limitations Although DLS is a highly useful method as discussed above, it suffers the following disadvantages:
(i) DLS measurements are very sensitive to temperature and solvent viscosity. Therefore, the temperature must be kept constant and solvent viscosity must be known for a reliable DLS experiment.
(ii) DLS is a low-resolution method that often cannot separate molecules that are closely related (e.g., monomer and dimer).
(iii) Although it is possible to measure the molecular weight using DLS where intensity of scattered light [K*c/R θ , where K* is an optical parameter,
c
is concentration and R θ
is an angular dependent light-scattering parameter, also known as the Rayleigh ratio; see Wyatt ( 1993 ) for more details] is plotted against concentration, it is not a very reliable and reproducible method. In such cases, alternate methods such as static light scattering coupled with multiangle laser light scattering and analytical ultracentrifuge should be used.
(iv) DLS is also restricted to transparent sample preparation.
(v) As the scattering intensity depends on the 6th power of the size of macromolecules ( I
proportional d 6
where d is a diameter of macromolecule), large aggregates — even a very small amount will affect the measurements. Therefore, the sample-holding cuvette must be cleaned thoroughly and sample must be filtered prior to DLS measurements.
( vi ) The signal from DLS depends on the size and concentration of macromolecules. Therefore, to obtain reliable measurements, optimization of range of concentration may be required.
Conclusions In this review, we have provided a brief historical and theoretical background on DLS. The examples for homogeneity and interaction studies of proteins, nucleic acids, and their complexes using a highly versatile DLS method are also presented. Although it suffers from minor limitations as discussed in section 6, it is gaining popularity in academic and industrial laboratories. DLS is a non-invasive method that provides fast, precise, and reproducible quality check to study aggregation in biomolecular preparation requiring very little amounts of sample.

Abstract Despite their inherent proximity to circulating oxygen and nutrients, endothelial cells (ECs) oxidize only a minor fraction of glucose in mitochondria, a metabolic specialization that is poorly understood. Here we show that the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) limits glucose oxidation, and maintains the growth and epigenetic state of ECs. We find that loss of PKM2 alters mitochondrial substrate utilization and impairs EC proliferation and migration in vivo. Mechanistically, we show that the NF-κB transcription factor RELB is responsive to PKM2 loss, limiting EC growth through the regulation of P53. Furthermore, S-adenosylmethionine synthesis is impaired in the absence of PKM2, resulting in DNA hypomethylation, de-repression of endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs) and activation of antiviral innate immune signalling. This work reveals the metabolic and functional consequences of glucose oxidation in the endothelium, highlights the importance of PKM2 for endothelial growth and links metabolic dysfunction with autoimmune activation in ECs.

Introduction The vertebrate vascular system comprises a vast and evolutionarily conserved network that supports tissue growth and homoeostasis 1 . Recent work has highlighted the high glycolytic rate of the endothelial cells (ECs) that line this network 2 , which under physiological conditions metabolize almost 90% of cellular glucose anaerobically to produce lactate 3 . The ability to generate ATP in this manner permits EC migration into non-perfused tissues and allows the expansion of vascular networks during organ growth 2 , 4 , 5 . Given these distinct metabolic traits, endothelial mitochondria have been considered to function largely as signalling organelles 6 , 7 , and the consequences of enhanced glucose oxidation in ECs are not well described. Recent work has shown that mitochondria play fundamental roles in EC growth and homoeostasis; β-oxidation of fatty acids is required for dNTP synthesis 8 , while glutamine metabolism is an essential source of TCA cycle intermediates that are necessary to support macromolecule biosynthesis in ECs 3 , 9 . To gain insight into the functional and metabolic consequences of glucose oxidation in ECs, we analysed the function of the pyruvate kinase (PK) isozyme PKM2, which has been associated with aerobic glycolysis and growth in cancer cells 10 , 11 , and the maintenance of mitochondrial function in diabetic nephropathy 12 . Pyruvate kinase catalyses the final step in glycolysis, generating pyruvate and ATP from phosphoenolpyruvate and ADP 13 . In higher vertebrates, two genes ( PKLR
and
PKM ) encode four PK isozymes that vary in their expression patterns and activity 14 . Alternative splicing of the
PKM
gene to include exon 9 or 10 generates the PKM1 and PKM2 isozymes, respectively 15 . While PKM1 exhibits constitutively high PK activity and its expression is associated with a decrease in cell growth, the catalytic activity of PKM2 is modulated allosterically by critical metabolic intermediates 16 , 17 , 18
and post-translationally in response to growth factor signalling and reactive oxygen species (ROS) 10 , 19 , providing a focal point for the integration of cellular signalling and redox status with glycolytic flux. Here we show that loss of PKM2 in ECs results in TCA cycle dysfunction, cell cycle arrest and the induction of viral mimicry by endogenous retroviral transcripts. Results Loss of endothelial PKM2 alters mitochondrial metabolism The
PKM
gene is abundantly expressed in ECs (Supplementary Figure  1a ), and RT-qPCR (Fig.  1a ) and western blot (Fig.  1b ) analyses show that PKM2 is the predominant isoform. To determine the function of endothelial PKM2, we first assessed the efficacy of validated siRNA duplexes targeting specifically PKM2 (PKM2 KD ) or both PKM splice isoforms (PKM KD ) in primary human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) (Supplementary Figure  1 ) 20 . Functionally, while neither PKM2 KD
nor PKM KD
significantly changed cellular energy charge (Fig.  1c ), incorporation of [U-13C 6 ]-glucose-derived carbon into m+3 lactate (Fig.  1d ) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) (Supplementary Figure  1g ) were significantly reduced in both conditions. The reduction in labelled lactate was coupled to an increase in [U-13C 6 ]-glucose labelling of citrate (Fig.  1e ) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) (Fig.  1f ) in PKM2 KD
ECs but not in PKM KD
ECs, indicating that PKM isoform expression is a critical determinant of the fate of glucose-derived carbon in ECs. Intriguingly, analysis of steady-state levels of TCA cycle intermediates revealed a decrease in total α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), fumarate and malate in PKM2 KD
and PKM KD
ECs, while aspartate levels were significantly increased only in PKM2 KD
ECs (Supplementary Figure  1h ). Furthermore, [U-13C 6 ]-glucose labelling of α-KG (Fig.  1g ) was significantly reduced in PKM2 KD
and PKM KD
ECs, while aspartate labelling was increased only in PKM2 KD
ECs (Fig.  1h ), indicating that significant changes to TCA cycle metabolism occur in the absence of PKM2. Glycolysis is not the sole carbon source for the TCA cycle, which is also fuelled by branched chain amino acid (BCAA) oxidation, pyruvate anaplerosis, fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and glutamine metabolism 3 , 9 . We found that PKM2 KD , but not PKM KD , led to a reduction in the ratio of keto-leucine to isoleucine (Fig.
1 i) and [U-13C 6 ]-glucose labelling of m+3 alanine (Fig.  1j ), while an accumulation of long-chain acylcarnitines (Fig.  1k ), and reduced m+3 malate (Supplementary Figure  1i ) were observed in both PKM2 KD
and PKM KD
ECs. These data indicate that BCAA oxidation, pyruvate anaplerosis and FAO are impaired in PKM2 KD
ECs. Mitochondria are an important source of ROS in endothelial cells, where at low levels ROS perform critical signalling functions 21 . We found that while the global ratio of GSSG/GSH (Supplementary Figure  1j ) and cellular ROS levels (Supplementary Figure  1k ) were not changed in PKM2 KD
ECs, there was an increase in mitochondrial superoxide levels (Fig.  1l ). Furthermore, we did not observe changes in mitochondrial DNA content (Supplementary Figure  1l ). Collectively, these data show that loss of PKM2 alters mitochondrial metabolism and is associated with the disruption of multiple pathways that fuel TCA cycle metabolism and cell growth. Fig. 1 Loss of endothelial PKM2 leads to mitochondrial dysfunction.

In HUVECs, PKM2 KD
led to a decrease in the number of 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine positive (EdU + ) (Fig.  2a ) and phospho-Histone H3 positive (pHH3 + ) (Supplementary Figure  2a ) ECs, and cell cycle arrest in G 0 /G 1
at 48 h after siRNA transfection (Supplementary Figure  2b ), resulting in a significant reduction in relative EC number (Fig.  2b ). We also observed a decrease in EC proliferation using ML265, a small-molecule activator of PKM2 tetramerization that mimics the effects of PKM2 loss of function, providing further evidence that modulation of PKM2 activity can inhibit EC proliferation (Supplementary Figure  2c ). Furthermore, PKM2 KD
significantly impaired wound closure in an in vitro scratch wound assay, indicating that PKM2 may also play an important role in EC migration (Fig.  2c ). To assess the in vivo relevance of these findings, we generated mutants in the zebrafish orthologues,
pkma
and
pkmb
(Supplementary Figure 2d–g). The zebrafish
pkma
gene displays a similar genomic organization as its mammalian orthologues (Supplementary Figure 2d), and is alternatively spliced into exon 9 or 10 to give rise to mRNAs that we have designated as
pkma1
and
pkma2 . In contrast, in zebrafish and other teleosts, the
pkmb
gene contains 11 exons and is not subject to alternative splicing (Supplementary Figure 2d). Clustering analysis based on a 56 amino acid sequence with homology to the amino acids encoded by exon 9 or 10 of the human
PKM
gene (Supplementary Figure 2e), indicates that
pkmb
is an orthologue of mammalian
PKM2 , not
PKM1 . Confocal analyses of wild-type, maternal zygotic
pkma2
( pkma2 mz ) and
pkma2 mz /pkmb −/−
mutant embryos revealed defects in the formation of the intersegmental vessels (ISVs) (Fig.  2d ). Live imaging demonstrated impaired proliferation and migration of ECs in the ISVs of
pkma2 mz /pkmb −/−
mutants (Supplementary Movie  1 ). Quantification of incomplete ISVs at 48 h post fertilization (hpf) reveals a significant increase in the number of ISVs that fail to make connections with their neighbours in
pkma2 mz /pkmb −/−
mutants (Fig.  2e ), indicating that Pkm2 regulates blood vessel growth in vivo. Fig. 2 Loss of PKM2 leads to angiogenic sprouting defects.

Pkm
gene (Supplementary Figure  3a, b ) in endothelial cells of mice and analysed angiogenesis in the postnatal retina. To this end, we intercrossed
Pkm2 flox
mice with
Pdgfb-Cre ERT2
mice (referred to hereafter as
Pkm2 iEC-KO ) and induced recombination by 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4-OHT) injection from postnatal day (P) 1–3. Staining of retinas for PECAM (marking EC membranes) and ERG (marking EC nuclei) at P7 revealed reduced outgrowth of a hypo-cellular vascular plexus in
Pkm2 iEC-KO
mice (Fig.  3a, b ). To determine the cause of this phenotype, we analysed the morphology and growth of vessels at the angiogenic front in PECAM, ERG and EdU-stained retinas (Fig.  3c ). Quantification revealed a significant reduction in EC number, proliferation, vessel area and branching in
Pkm2 iEC-KO
mice (Fig.  3d ). In contrast to the vascular defects at the angiogenic front, the central plexus of the retina was less affected by PKM2 inactivation using the
Pdgfb-Cre ERT2
(Supplementary Figure 3c). While endothelial cellularity was significantly reduced, vessel area and branch point density were similar to controls (Supplementary Figure 3e). These findings are consistent with the enrichment of PKM2 in angiogenic ECs 22
and suggest that PKM2 signalling is particularly important for vessel sprouting at the growing angiogenic front. To assess the possible contribution of vessel regression, we quantified the number of empty collagen IV +
sleeves and observed no significant difference between control and
Pkm2 iEC-KO
mice (Supplementary Figure 3d, e). Taken together, these data suggest that PKM2 is a crucial regulator of endothelial migration and proliferation, whose inactivation compromises vascular expansion. Fig. 3 Acute deletion of

c  = 200 μm Full size image Coordinated metabolic and protein changes following PKM2 loss To gain further insight into the global metabolic changes associated with loss of endothelial PKM2, we performed pathway analyses of steady-state metabolites and identified pathways linked to mitochondrial metabolism 23 , 24 , including TCA cycle, pyrimidine synthesis and cysteine and methionine metabolism (Fig.  4a , specific metabolites highlighted in Fig.  4b ). Deletion of
PKM2
in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) leads to impaired pyrimidine synthesis that does not correlate with gene expression changes 25 . To determine if loss of PKM2 is associated with gene expression changes in ECs, we performed a proteomics analysis that revealed changes to the expression of a number of key enzymes in the pyrimidine synthesis, and serine, glycine and one-carbon metabolism (SGOC) pathways (Fig.  4c
and Supplementary Figure 4a). These data indicate that the metabolic changes observed in PKM2 KD
ECs (Fig.  4a, b ) correlate with protein-level changes in the key enzymes controlling these pathways, leading us to hypothesize that there may be a coordinated transcriptional response to the loss of PKM2 in ECs. Fig. 4 Loss of PKM2 leads to coordinated metabolic and protein expression changes.

ECs (Supplementary Figure 5a, b). We thus set out to test if these pathways regulate EC growth in the absence of PKM2. Co-transfection of siRNA duplexes targeting

RELB
significantly rescued the number of EdU +

and PKM2 KD /RELB KD
ECs revealed that RELB expression was increased in the absence of PKM2 and acts to induce the expression of P53 and its downstream target P21 (Fig.  5b ). Fig. 5 RELB-P53 suppresses endothelial growth in the absence of PKM2.

ECs. Quantification of EdU and phospho-Histone H3 (Fig.  5c ) positive ECs, and total cell numbers (Supplementary Figure 5d) revealed a significant rescue of the cell cycle arrest observed in PKM2 KD
ECs following P53 silencing. Furthermore, western blot analysis showed that the increase in P53 and its transcriptional target P21 in PKM2 KD
ECs was abolished by co-transfecting siRNA duplexes targeting
P53 , while RELB expression was unchanged (Fig.  5d ). These data show that RELB acts upstream of P53–P21 to induce cell cycle arrest in the absence of PKM2. In addition to its well-documented tumour suppressor functions 30 , there is an increasing appreciation of the importance of P53 in the regulation of metabolism in response to various types of cellular stress 26 . In tumour cells deprived of exogenous serine, P53 promotes glutathione synthesis at the expense of nucleotides to promote cell survival 31 . To identify potential transcriptional and metabolic changes controlled by P53, we performed RNA-seq and metabolomics analyses in control, P53 KD , PKM2 KD
and PKM2 KD /P53 KD
ECs. Analysis of the transcriptional response (Supplementary Figure 5e) revealed that P53 regulates the expression of key enzymes in the pyrimidine synthesis pathway (Fig.  5e ). Volcano plots displaying metabolite profiles show that the relative levels of a number of metabolites in the pyrimidine synthesis pathway are reduced following PKM2 KD
(Supplementary Figure 5f), and that silencing of P53 leads to a relative normalization of the levels of these metabolites (Supplementary Figure 5g). Comprehensive analysis of nucleotide levels revealed that PKM2 KD
reduced the relative levels of
N -carbamoyl aspartate, UTP and dTTP, and impaired incorporation of glucose-derived carbon into UTP, while silencing of P53 increased the levels of these metabolites (Fig.  5f ). Collectively, these data indicate that a P53-dependent transcriptional programme controls the reduction in pyrimidine nucleotide levels in ECs lacking PKM2. Loss of PKM2 impairs methylation capacity and DNA methylation In addition to changes in the pyrimidine synthesis pathway, loss of PKM2 also led to significant changes in the steady-state levels of the one-carbon metabolite s-adenosylmethionine (SAM) (Fig.  4b ), which were coupled to reduced expression of enzymes in the SGOC network (Fig.  4c ). As the primary cellular methyl group donor, the abundance of SAM determines the methylation status of a broad range of substrates, including DNA and histones 32 . SAM is an intermediate metabolite in a wider metabolic network that encompasses the folate and methionine cycles, termed one-carbon metabolism 24 , and is synthesized from ATP and methionine, by methionine adenosyltransferases (MAT). MAT1A expression is restricted to the liver, while MAT2A and MAT2B are expressed in non-hepatic tissues and their expression levels have been shown to positively correlate with DNA methylation 33 . Western blot analysis of control, P53 KD , PKM2 KD
and PKM2 KD /P53 KD
ECs revealed a P53-independent reduction in the expression of MAT2A in the absence of PKM2 (Fig.  6a ). Metabolomic analyses of control, P53 KD , PKM2 KD
and PKM2 KD /P53 KD
ECs showed a significant reduction in the steady-state levels of SAM (Fig.  6b ), with no concomitant decrease in S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) in PKM2 KD
and PKM2 KD /P53 KD
ECs (Fig.  6b ), leading to a P53-independent drop in the ratio of SAM:SAH (Fig.  6b ). These changes were associated with a reduction in the SAM-derived metabolite S-methyl-5-thioadenosine (5MTA) in PKM2 KD
and PKM2 KD /P53 KD
ECs, with no change in methionine levels or GSH/GSSG ratio (Supplementary Figure 6a). Altogether, these data indicate that loss of PKM2 leads to reduced levels of SAM, in a manner that is independent of cell cycle arrest or regulation by P53. A reduction in the SAM:SAH ratio has been linked to a decrease in cellular methylation capacity 34 , and as a consequence, we identified a significant reduction in global DNA methylation, as assessed by measuring the levels of methylated cytosine in control and PKM2 KD
ECs (Fig.  6c ). Fig. 6 Loss of PKM2 impairs methylation capacity, reduces DNA methylation and leads to the expression of endogenous retroviral elements.

(*** P  < 0.001, ** P  < 0.01, * P  < 0.05 by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s HSD test) Full size image Loss of PKM2 leads to endogenous retrovirus expression Methylation of DNA controls a number of biological processes that include promoter inactivation, X-chromosome silencing and the silencing of transposable elements 35 . Retrotransposons make up close to 45% of the human genome 36
and consist of two classes, long terminal repeat (LTR) and non-LTR transposons 37 . De-repression of these elements is associated with activation of the endogenous antiviral defence pathway 37 . In response to an increase of cytosolic viral RNA, a signalling cascade is triggered that begins with recognition by cytosolic sensors, activation of interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-NF-κB signalling and subsequent induction of interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression 38 . Intriguingly, global knockout of
Pkm2
in mouse was recently shown to increase systemic inflammation 14 , and
Pkm2 −/−
MEFs display increased expression of the ISGs
Ifi44
and
Ifih1 25 , leading us to hypothesize that loss of PKM2 may lead to the activation of innate immune signalling as a consequence of reduced DNA methylation. Analysis of our proteomics data set revealed changes in the expression of genes associated with antiviral defence (Fig.  6d
and Supplementary Figure 6b). Furthermore, mRNA levels of a number of ISGs were increased in PKM2 KD
ECs (Supplementary Figure 6c), and analysis of published microarray data 25
revealed that ISGs are induced in
Pkm2 −/−
MEFs (Supplementary Figure 6d), indicating that loss of PKM2 can lead to the activation of an innate immune response in multiple cell types and species. DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibition was recently shown to permit the expression of endogenous retroviral (ERV) elements, leading to the formation of cytosolic dsRNA and activation of innate antiviral signalling 39 , 40 .
IFIH1
(MDA5) encodes a cytosolic pattern recognition receptor that recognizes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) 41 , and its expression is upregulated in both PKM2 loss-of-function ECs (Supplementary Figure 6c) and MEFs (Supplementary Figure 6d). We therefore investigated if loss of PKM2 might lead to the accumulation of dsRNAs in ECs using the J2 antibody, and found a significant increase in dsRNA levels in PKM2 KD
ECs (Fig.  6e, f ). In addition, RT-qPCR analyses of control and PKM2 KD
ECs revealed an increase in the expression of a subclass of ERVs (Fig.  6g ), which are induced in response to DNMT inhibition 39 . To understand if increased ERV expression in PKM2 KD
ECs was linked to changes in DNA methylation, we performed site-specific restriction digestion of PCR-amplified bisulfite-converted DNA at the
MLT1B
and
MER4D
loci. These analyses revealed a mild reduction in DNA methylation at the
MLT1B
and
MER4D
loci in PKM2 KD
ECs (Fig.  6h ), the extent of which was likely limited by the cell cycle arrest observed following loss of PKM2. Histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3), which has been shown to contribute to ERV repression in embryonic stem cells 42 , was not changed in PKM2 KD
ECs (Supplementary Figure 7a). Collectively, our data indicate that loss of PKM2 leads to reduced DNA methylation, which triggers viral mimicry induced by expression of endogenous retroviral transcripts. ERV expression levels are limited by RELB P53 has been shown to limit the expression of retrotransposons in MEFs treated with DNMT inhibitors 43 , and the NF-κB transcription factor family is known to induce the expression of ISGs, forming a critical component of the innate immune response to viral infection 44 . Given the increased expression of both P53 and RELB in the absence of PKM2, we hypothesized that these transcription factors may regulate ISG and/or ERV expression in ECs. Loss of P53 did not significantly alter ISG expression (Supplementary Figure 7b), ERV expression (Supplementary Figure 7b) or DNA methylation (Supplementary Figure 7c) in PKM2 KD
ECs. In contrast,
RELB
silencing led to a dramatic increase in ERV and ISG mRNA levels in both RELB KD
and PKM2 KD /RELB KD
ECs (Fig.  6i ). Furthermore, analysis of previously published microarray data from
Relb −/−
mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells revealed increased expression of numerous ISGs (Supplementary Figure 7d) 45 , indicating that RELB limits innate immune activation in multiple cell types. RELB is known to suppress transcription through the directed recruitment of DNA methyltransferases and chromatin remodelling factors 46 , leading us to hypothesize that RELB may limit ERV expression by regulating local chromatin composition. Analysis of the
MLT1B
and
MER4D
loci showed that RELB KD
did not significantly alter DNA methylation (Supplementary Figure 7e), while H3K9me3 levels were also unchanged (Supplementary Figure 7f). Collectively, these data show that RELB is a key regulator of the innate immune response in ECs, which acts in a DNA methylation and H3K9me3-independent manner to limit ERV expression (Supplementary Figure 7g). Discussion This study highlights the importance of PKM2 for growth and homoeostasis of the vascular endothelium and identifies molecular changes associated with its absence. PKM2 has been linked with anabolic cell growth in various experimental settings 10 , 11 , 47 , and its loss is associated with a PKM1-dependent impairment of pyrimidine synthesis and cell cycle arrest in MEFs 25 . In the present study, we observed distinct changes in metabolism in PKM2 KD
and PKM KD
ECs, indicating that the PKM isoforms differentially regulate EC metabolism. For example, oxygen consumption and [U-13C 6 ]-glucose labelling of citrate were increased only in PKM2 KD
ECs, indicating that PKM1 may enhance the oxidative metabolism of glucose in mitochondria. In contrast, we observed reduced labelling of lactate and α-KG, and increased mitochondrial superoxide levels in PKM2 KD
and PKM KD
ECs, indicating that the levels of these metabolites are predominantly regulated by PKM2. Recent genetic analyses in mouse have demonstrated that chronic deletion of PKM2 does not impact cell proliferation, due to compensatory upregulation of the
Pkm
splice isoform PKM1 14 , 48 . Our genetic analysis of PKM2 function, using conditional deletion of PKM2 specifically in ECs, reveals that loss of PKM2 reduces EC proliferation in vivo and indicates that acute loss or transient inhibition of PKM2 may lead to fundamentally different effects on cell growth than chronic loss. Furthermore, we provide evidence that impaired nucleotide synthesis in cells lacking PKM2 can be regulated at the transcriptional level by RELB-P53 signalling. The NF-κB and P53 transcriptional networks are known to respond to a variety of cellular stress stimuli, and our data indicate that RELB-P53 signalling may play an important role in the response of the endothelium to metabolic dysfunction, by limiting cell growth. There is an increasing appreciation of the important link between intermediary metabolism and chromatin structure and function 32 , 49 , with the availability of nutrients linked to modifications of DNA 50
and histones 51 . One of the most striking metabolic changes that we observed in ECs lacking PKM2 was a reduction in the one-carbon metabolite, SAM, which is required for the methylation of a broad range of substrates, including cytosine residues in DNA. In yeast, the PKM2 orthologue Pyk1 was identified as a component of a complex named SESAME (serine-responsive SAM containing metabolic enzyme complex), that was shown to regulate chromatin modifications 52 . While in the present study we did not identify an orthologous mammalian SESAME complex, we observed protein-level changes in a number of key enzymes in the serine, glycine and one-carbon metabolic network. Decreased expression of the SAM-synthesizing enzyme MAT2A and reduced steady-state levels of SAM were independent of P53, indicating that this effect is not merely a consequence of cell cycle arrest. Taken together, these data indicate that loss or inhibition of PKM2 may lead to changes in chromatin structure and function. As a consequence of DNA hypomethylation, we observed increased ERV, dsRNA and ISG levels in ECs lacking PKM2. The fold induction of ERV and ISG expression in PKM2 KD
ECs was more limited than previously reported in HCT116 cells treated with DNMT inhibitors 40 . These differences may reflect the relatively minor changes in DNA methylation observed in PKM2 KD
ECs, or result from cell-type-specific differences in ERV de-repression, as previously described 53 . Examination of published microarray analyses of
Pkm2
knockout MEFs 25
shows increased expression of a number of ISGs, indicating that loss of PKM2 can trigger innate immune signalling in different cell types. In addition to its role in the maintenance of metabolic homoeostasis, global deletion of
Pkm2
was recently shown to result in systemic inflammation in mice 14 . Our data indicate that inflammation associated with loss of PKM2 may, at least in part, be due to the de-repression of endogenous retroviral elements that trigger chronic activation of autoimmune signalling in both ECs and other cell types. More broadly, they indicate that metabolic dysfunction may be a trigger for autoimmune disease. The role of NF-κB in the regulation of immune signalling is well established 54 . We have uncovered a homoeostatic function for RELB as a suppressor of ERV expression in ECs, which limits activation of antiviral innate immune signalling. The mechanisms through which RELB limits ERV expression remain to be identified, and could involve modifications to local chromatin composition or direct regulation of transcription (Supplementary Figure 7g). Examination of previously published microarray analysis of bone marrow dendritic cells from
Relb −/−
mice 45
shows that RELB limits ISG expression, likely by limiting ERV expression, in multiple cell types. Furthermore,
Relb
knockout mice display chronic inflammation characterized by immune cell infiltration into multiple tissues 55 , a phenotype we hypothesize may occur as a result of ERV de-repression. Collectively, these findings broaden our understanding of how endothelial metabolism is controlled and link metabolic changes with the control of growth, epigenetics and immune responses in ECs. Methods Cell culture Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were purchased from Lonza or Life Technologies, authenticated for EC marker expression and cultured until the fourth passage. HUVECs were cultured in endothelial basal medium-2 (EBM-2, Lonza) supplemented with foetal bovine serum, hydrocortisone, human basic fibroblast growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, R3-insulin-like growth factor, ascorbic acid, human epidermal growth factor, GA-1000 and heparin. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum (Thermo), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Both cell lines were cultured in 5% CO 2
at 37 °C. RNA interference For pan-PKM or PKM2-specific silencing, siRNAs directed against
PKM
or specifically targeting exon 10 of the
PKM
gene have been described previously 20 . We validated the effect of three siRNA duplexes by assessing knockdown efficiency using RT-qPCR and western blot, and cell proliferation by quantifying EdU +
cell numbers, glucose uptake, lactate and ATP levels. The following siRNA duplex was used for further studies: PKM2_si156:ccauaaucguccucaccaa.
P53 ,
RELA ,
RELB
and
REL
were targeted with pools of siRNA duplexes (Mission esiRNA, Sigma). A negative control pool of four siRNAs (ON-TARGETplus Non-targeting pool, Dharmacon) was used to control for transfection. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) with the manufacturer's standard protocol. For all RNAi experiments, cells were re-seeded 24 h after siRNA transfection to reach a confluence of ~80% at 48 h after transfection. RT-qPCR RNA was isolated using the miRNeasy micro Kit (Qiagen) combined with on-column DNase digestion (DNase-Free DNase Set, Qiagen). An aliquot of 1 μg of RNA was used for reverse transcription with the Maxima First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo). All PCR reactions were run on a CFX Connect Real-Time System (Biorad). The following primer pairs were used:
PKM1 _fwd-CTATCCTCTGGAGGCTGTGC,
PKM1 _rev-CCATGAGGTCTGTGGAGTGA;
PKM2 _fwd-CCACTTGCAATTATTTGAGGAA,
PKM2 _rev-GTGAGCAGACCTGCCAGACT;
TBP _fwd-GGAGAGTTCTGGGATTGTAC,
TBP _rev-CTTATCCTCATGATTACCGCAG. For analysis of endogenous retrovirus expression, previously published primer pairs were used 40 . Expression levels were normalized to
Tbp
expression and fold changes calculated using the ∆∆Ct method. Western blot analysis and antibodies HUVECs were lysed in modified RIPA buffer (150 m M
NaCl, 50 m M
Tris–HCl pH 7.4, 1% IGEPAL, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 m M
EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors (cOmplete ULTRA Mini, Roche) and PMSF. Proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE on precast TGX gradient gels (Biorad) and then transferred to polyvinylidine fluoride membranes using the Transblot Turbo Transfer System (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked in 5% BSA for 1 h, probed with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and then with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The following antibodies were used: PKM1 (Cell Signaling Technology, #7067, 1:1000), PKM2 (Cell Signaling Technology, #4053, 1:1000), P21 (Cell Signaling Technology, #2947, 1:1000), P53 (Cell Signaling Technology, #9282, 1:500), P53 (Santa Cruz, sc-126, 1:1000), RELB (Cell Signaling Technology, #10544, 1:1000), MAT2A (Novus Biologicals, #NB110-94158, 1:2000), β-actin (Cell Signaling Technology, #8457, 1:1000), GAPDH (Cell Signaling Technology, #2118, 1:2000) and anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2004, 1:10,000). For analysis, membranes were incubated with ECL (Clarity Western ECL Substrate, Biorad) and imaged using a ChemiDoc MP system (Biorad). Uncropped images of blots are presented in Supplementary Figure 8. Seahorse metabolic analysis Functional metabolic analyses in HUVECs were performed using a Seahorse XFe96 analyser (Seahorse Bioscience) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, HUVECs (40,000 per well) were seeded on fibronectin-coated XFe96 microplates. After 2 h, the cell medium was changed to a non-buffered assay medium and cells were maintained in a non-CO 2
incubator for 1 h. Using the Glycolysis Stress Test Kit, extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) was assessed under basal conditions, and sequentially following the addition of glucose (10 mM), the mitochondrial ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin (3 µM) or 2-deoxy- d -glucose (2-DG; 100 mM), an inhibitor of glycolysis. Using the Mito Stress Test Kit, oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was measured sequentially under basal conditions, after injection of oligomycin (3 µM), the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl-hydrazone (FCCP; 1 µM), and after injection of a mix of the respiratory chain inhibitors antimycin A (1.5 µM) and rotenone (3 µM). Lactate assay Lactate concentration was measured in HUVEC cell culture medium that was conditioned for 12 h. The measurement was performed with a Lactate assay kit (Biovision) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Glucose uptake assay Endothelial glucose uptake was assessed by analysing the uptake of 2-NBDG (2-(N-(7-Nitobenz-2oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)Amino)-2-Deoxyglucose) (Life Technologies), a fluorescent glucose analogue. HUVECs were incubated for 1 h in media containing 100 µM 2-NBDG and fluorescence was measured using the BD FACS LSR II flow cytometer. Data were analysed with the BD FACSDiva software (Version 8.0.1). Immunostaining of cell cultures Twenty-four hours after transfection, HUVECs were re-seeded in 96-well imaging plates (Ibidi) to reach ~80% confluence at 48 h after transfection. For EdU staining, cells were cultured in EGM2 media containing 10 μM EdU (Thermo) for 3 h prior to fixation at 37 °C and in 5% CO 2 . Cells were fixed in 4% PFA for 15 min at room temperature and then permeabilised with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min. To prevent antibody binding to non-specific epitopes, blocking was performed for 1 h in 5% goat serum, 1% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The following primary antibodies were used: phospho-Histone H3 (Cell Signaling Technology, #9713, 1:500) and J2A (Scicons, 1:200). Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies were used for detection (Thermo, 1:250). The Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 647 imaging kit was used for detection of EdU incorporation (Thermo). Imaging was performed using an LSM800 Observer (Zeiss). Cell cycle analyses Control, PKM2 KD , PKM KD , P53 KD
and/or PKM2 KD /P53 KD
HUVECs were harvested 48 h after transfection at ~80% confluence. Adherent cells were fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol and then stored at −20 °C overnight. For staining, cells were washed twice in PBS, resuspended in a solution of 50 mg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) containing RNase (Sigma-Aldrich #R6513) in 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Data were acquired using a BD FACS LSR II flow cytometer. In vitro scratch wound assay HUVECs were transfected with contol or PKM2 siRNAs and after 24 h seeded in 24-well plates to reach 100% confluency at 48 h after transfection. At this stage, a scratch wound was applied to the EC monolayer using a 200 μl pipette tip, and individual wells were imaged ( T 0 ). HUVECs were incubated for a further 8 h in complete media, photographed again and the percentage wound closure in ctrl and PKM2 KD
ECs calculated using ImageJ. Generation of zebrafish mutants with TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 Animals were maintained under standard conditions and all experiments were conducted in accordance with institutional (MPG) and national ethical and animal welfare guidelines. TALENs were used to generate
pkma2 s717
mutants and CRISPR/Cas9 was used to generate
pkmb s718
mutants as previously described 56 . For the generation of
pkma2
mutants, TALEN arms composed of the following RVDs targeting exon 10 of the
pkma
gene were used: NN NI HD HD HD NN NG NN NI HD HD HD NG NG HD NI NN NI NG NN HD and NG NG NN NI NI NN NN NI NI NN HD HD NG HD NN NI HD NN NN. RNA was synthesized with mMESSAGE mMachine (Ambion) and 50 pg per TALEN arm was injected into one-cell stage embryos to generate potential founders ( F 0 ). Analysis of mRNA expression in
pkma2 +/+
and
pkma2 −/−
embryos at 26 hpf revealed no changes in
pkma1
expression in
pkma2
mutants (Supplementary Figure 2h). For CRISPR/Cas9, sgRNAs were designed using the CRISPR Design online toolbox ( http://crispr.mit.edu ) and the following guide sequence was used to target exon 5 of the
pkmb
gene: TGTGGAACAGGGCGTGGACATGG. Guide RNAs were made by ligating annealed primers into the pT7-gRNA vector, and the pT3Ts-nCas9n plasmid (Addgene) was used to synthesize Cas9 mRNA. To generate founders, between 50 pg of sgRNA and 250 pg of Cas9 mRNA were coinjected into one-cell stage embryos.
F 0
founders for each gene were identified by outcrossing TALEN or CRISPR/Cas9-injected fish with AB and screening the offspring at 24 hpf using HRMA. PCR products from
F 0
founders that showed promising HRMA melt curves were cloned and sequenced, and those with frameshift mutations were grown. Primer sequences for HRMA genotyping were as follows:
pkma2 _HRMA_fwd: CTGTTCTGACCCGTGACCCTTC;
pkma2 _HRMA_rev: GGTGAGTATGATGATGCCGC;
pkmb _HRMA_fwd: CTGAGAAGGACATCAAGGACC;
pkmb _HRMA_rev: AGCAGCTTTGCGGATAAAGGAGG. Mutants were generated in the
Tg(kdrl:EGFP) s843
background 57 . Mouse experiments Animals were maintained under standard conditions and all experiments were conducted in accordance with institutional (MPG) and national ethical and animal welfare guidelines. Conditional PKM2 mutant mice ( Pkm tm1.1Mgvh ) were backcrossed to the C57/Bl6 background. For conditional EC-specific deletion, PKM2-floxed mice were bred with
Tg(Pdgfb-icre/ERT2) 1 Frut
mice, which express the tamoxifen-inducible CreERT2 in ECs. For analysis of angiogenesis in the retina, postnatal mice were injected intraperitoneally with 25 μl of 4-Hydoxytamoxifen (2 mg/ml, H6278, Sigma) on postnatal days (P)1–P3 and retinas were harvested on P7. Control animals were littermates without CreERT2 expression. Due to the nature of the experimental setup, animals were randomly assigned to treatment groups. Only litters that reached normal body weight at P7 were used. Mice that were more than 1.5 interquartile ranges (IQR) above or below the upper or lower IQR for their respective litter were not analysed. Immunostaining and analysis of postnatal retinas For quantitative analysis of angiogenesis, eyes were harvested from P7 mice and fixed in 4% PFA on ice for 2 h. After fixation, eyes were washed in PBS and then dissected to remove the retinal tissue. Following dissection, retinas were incubated in blocking buffer (3% normal goat serum, 1% BSA, 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.5% Tween-20) for 1 h at RT and then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in incubation buffer (1.5% normal goat serum, 0.5% BSA, 0.25% Triton X-100 and 0.25% Tween-20) overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies against the following proteins were used: PECAM (1:200, #AF3628, R&D Systems), ERG (1:200, #ab92513, Abcam), Collagen IV (1:400, #2150-1470, AbD Serotec). After primary antibody incubation, retinas were washed four times in 0.1% PBS Triton X-100 and incubated with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Thermo, 1:250) for 2 h at RT. Following secondary antibody staining, retinas were washed four times in 0.1% PBS Triton X-100 and the Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 647 imaging kit was used for detection of EdU incorporation (Thermo). Retinas were mounted on glass slides using Vectashield (Vector Labs) and imaging was performed using a Zeiss LSM700 or Leica SP8 microscope. All images were acquired without prior knowledge of the genotype of the individual samples. Quantitative analysis of the retinal vasculature Outgrowth of the retinal vasculature was measured using ImageJ software as the distance from the centre of the optic nerve to the periphery of the vessel bed in each leaflet of dissected retinas. The mean distance of individual leaflets was taken as the value for each sample. For quantification of EC and EdU +
EC number, vessel area, branch point density and empty Collagen IV sleeves, four fields per sample were acquired using a ×25 objective. The total number of ECs and EdU +
EC number was determined using Imaris Software. The mean of four fields per sample at the angiogenic front or central plexus was taken as the value for each sample. EC area per field and branch point density was determined using the AngioTool software. Empty Collagen IV sleeves were counted manually using ImageJ. These analyses were not blinded. LC-HRMS metabolomics and flux analysis For measurement of steady-state metabolite levels, control, PKM2 KD , PKM KD , P53 KD
and/or PKM2 KD /P53 KD
HUVECs were harvested 48 h after transfection in 80% methanol pre-cooled to −80 °C. Plates were transferred to a −80 °C freezer for 15 min to inactivate enzyme functions, then scraped into extraction solvent and centrifuged at 20,000 ×  g
for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then collected and dried for ~2 h in a speed-vac at room temperature. Dried pellets were stored at −80 °C. For flux analyses, 50:50 labelling was performed using [U-13C 6 ]glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc) as a tracer, and metabolite extraction and storage was performed as above. Metabolomics was performed using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). An ultimate 3000 UHPLC (Dionex) is coupled to the Q Exactive Plus-Mass spectrometer (QE-MS, Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) for metabolite separation and detection. Detailed instrument method information was described previously 58 . Samples were reconstituted into 30 µl sample solvent (water:methanol:acetonitrile, 2:1:1, v/v), and 4 μl was injected to the LC-QE-MS. The peak area of each metabolite was used to present relative abundance and to calculate the isotopologue distribution. All data are provided in Supplementary Data File  1 . Proteomics analysis Control and PKM2 KD
HUVECs were harvested in 4% SDS, 0.1 M Tris–HCl (pH 7.6) 48 h after transfection. Samples were sonicated, clarified by centrifugation and protein concentration was estimated using the DCA protein assay kit. Proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE on precast TGX gradient gels (Bio-Rad) and stained using the Colloidal Blue staining kit (Invitrogen). Each lane of the gel was cut into slices, and proteins were digested as previously described 56 . Briefly, gel pieces were washed with 50 mM ammoniumbicarbonate and ethanol, reduced with 10 mM DTT for 45 min at 56 °C, carbamidomethylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min at RT in the dark, and then digested with trypsin overnight. The next day, peptides were extracted from the gel pieces using increasing concentrations of acetonitrile. Samples were cleaned up with Stage Tips (Stop and go extraction) and then measured with LC-MS/MS on a QExactive HF. Separation of peptides according to their hydrophobicities was achieved on a 15 cm in-house packed column (internal diameter 75 μm, C18 Beads (Dr. Maisch) diameter 1.8 μm) using a binary buffer system: (A) 0.1% formic acid in H 2 O and (B) 0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile. The following gradient of 75 min was used: 5 min 10% of B, 50 min 38% of B, 5 min 60% of B, 10 min 95% of B, 5 min 5% of B. Mass spectra were acquired at a resolution of 60,000 (200  m/z ) using an AGC target of 3e6 and a maximal injection time of 20 ms. A top 15 method was applied for subsequent acquisition of high-energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) fragmentation MS/MS spectra of the 15 most intense peaks. Fragmentation (MS/MS) was performed with a resolution of 15,000 at 2.2  m/z
and and AGC target of 1e5 within a maximal injection time of 25 ms. Raw files were processed using MaxQuant 1.5.5.1 and the Andromeda search engine. For peptide assignment, MS/MS HCD fragmentation spectra were correlated to the Uniprot Homo sapiens database (2016). Further downstream analyses were performed as previously described. All data are provided in Supplementary Data File  2 . RNA-seq analysis and data processing RNA was isolated from 48 h after transfection from control, P53 KD , PKM2 KD
and PKM2 KD /P53 KD
HUVECs using the miRNeasy micro Kit (Qiagen) combined with on-column DNase digestion (DNase-Free DNase Set, Qiagen). RNA and library preparation integrity were verified with a BioAnalyzer 2100 (Agilent) or LabChip Gx Touch 24 (Perkin Elmer).2 µg of total RNA was used as input for Truseq Stranded mRNA Library preparation following the low sample protocol (Illumina). Sequencing was performed on the NextSeq500 instrument (Illumina) using v2 chemistry, resulting in a minimum of 37M reads per library with 1 × 75 bp single end setup. The resulting raw reads were assessed for quality, adaptor content and duplication rates with FastQC 59 . Reaper version 13–100 was employed to trim reads after a quality drop below a mean of Q20 in a window of ten nucleotides 60 . Only reads between 30 and 150 nucleotides were cleared for further analyses. Trimmed and filtered reads were aligned to the GRCh37.p5 human genome assembly using STAR 2.4.0a with the parameter “--outFilterMismatchNoverLmax 0.1” to increase the maximum ratio of mismatches to mapped length to 10% 61 . The number of reads aligning to genes was counted with the featureCounts 1.4.5-p1 tool from the Subread package 62 . Only reads mapping at least partially inside exons were admitted and aggregated per gene. Reads overlapping multiple genes or aligning to multiple regions were excluded. Differentially expressed genes were identified using DESeq2 version 1.62 63 . 5-methylcytosine quantification The levels of 5-methylcytosine were measured using the MethylFlash Methylated DNA quantification kit (Epigenetik) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) ChIP was performed using the truChIP Chromatin Shearing Reagent kit (Covaris) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Chromatin was sheared (Bioruptor, Diagenode) to generate fragments between 200 and 400 bp. 5 μg of DNA was used for each immunoprecipitation and 10% was stored as an input. Immunoprecipitation was performed following a published protocol 64
using the following antibodies: Mouse IgG (2 μg/IP, 5441S, Cell Signaling) and Histone H3 (tri methyl K9) (2 μg/IP, ab8898, Abcam). Following immunoprecipitation and reverse cross-linking, samples and inputs were purified using the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel) following the manufacturer’s instructions for samples containing SDS. Bisulfite conversion and restriction analyses Genomic DNA was isolated from 80% confluent control, PKM2 KD , P53 KD , PKM2 KD /P53 KD , RELB KD
and PKM2 KD /RELB KD
HUVECs 48 h after transfection, using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen, 69504). Bisulfite conversion was performed using the EpiJET Bisulfite Conversion Kit (Thermo Scientific, #K1461) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR amplification of bisulfite-converted DNA was performed using Phusion U Hot Start DNA Polymerase (Thermo Scientific, F555S) with the following primers:
MLT1B _Fwd—AGTTATAGATAGGTATAGAGTGTTGGTTTATAG;
MLT1B _Rev—CCTATTCTAACCATTTTCTATCAATAAAATC;
MER4D _Fwd—TTTGAGGAAGTGTGTTTGAGGTTGTTAGGATG;
MER4D _Rev—CCTCTAACACTACCTTAACTCAAACATTTC. Following PCR amplification, samples were purified and then digested with HpyCH4III ( MER4D ) or HincII ( MLT1B ) for 8 h, and visualized on a 3% agarose gel. Blinding The individual genotypes of mice and zebrafish were unknown before data analysis was performed. Statistical analyses No statistical tests were used to predetermine sample size. Statistical analyses were performed by unpaired, two-tailed Student's
t
test, or non-parametric one-way ANOVA followed by Tukeys HSD test using GraphPad Prism software. Data are represented as mean ± s.d. for individual data points and mean ± s.e.m. where values presented are calculated as a mean of means.

Abstract
This review summarizes and assesses recent theoretical and experimental
advances, with special emphasis on the effective interaction between
charge-stabilized colloids, in the bulk or in confined geometries, and on the
ambiguities of defining an effective charge of the colloidal particles. Some
consideration is given to the often neglected discrete solvent effects.
Keyword(s):

Synthesis and processing Two-dimensional materials
Abstract The application of strain to semiconductors allows for controlled modification of their band structure. This principle is employed for the manufacturing of devices ranging from high-performance transistors to solid-state lasers. Traditionally, strain is typically achieved via growth on lattice-mismatched substrates. For two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, this is not feasible as they typically do not interact epitaxially with the substrate. Here, we demonstrate controlled strain engineering of 2D semiconductors during synthesis by utilizing the thermal coefficient of expansion mismatch between the substrate and semiconductor. Using WSe 2
as a model system, we demonstrate stable built-in strains ranging from 1% tensile to 0.2% compressive on substrates with different thermal coefficient of expansion. Consequently, we observe a dramatic modulation of the band structure, manifested by a strain-driven indirect-to-direct bandgap transition and brightening of the dark exciton in bilayer and monolayer WSe 2 , respectively. The growth method developed here should enable flexibility in design of more sophisticated devices based on 2D materials.

Introduction Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have been the subject of focused research owing to their potential applications in optoelectronics and sub 10 nm transistors 1 ,
2 . The primary attraction of TMDCs such as MoS 2
and WSe 2
for both applications is their naturally terminated surface, which allows them to be scaled down to the atomic limit without the concern of surface dangling bonds. Furthermore, in many 2D materials, a number of desirable properties emerge at the monolayer limit, the most notable of which being the presence of a direct bandgap. Many studies based on mechanical bending of exfoliated 2D TMDCs have been conducted on flexible substrates, and they have shown that the application of strain can tune the properties of this new class of materials 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 . For example, it has been demonstrated that in multilayer WSe 2 , particularly in nominally indirect-gap bilayer WSe 2 , application of tensile strain can result in a transition from an indirect-to-direct bandgap 7 . However, studies on the effects of strain in TMDCs have been limited to mechanical bending of samples, and there has yet to be a technique, which can directly realize built-in tensile and compressive strains. Traditionally, strain engineering of semiconductors has been leveraged to tune the electronic band structure of high-performance devices, the most notable of which being to reduce intervalley scattering, increase mobility in Si transistors, and reduce the hole effective mass in III–V semiconductor lasers 8 ,
9 . Growth on epitaxial substrates with a controlled lattice constant mismatch has typically been utilized to establish built-in strain in three-dimensional semiconductors 10 . However, due to the relatively weak interaction between 2D materials and substrates, this established method of strain engineering is likely not applicable for the strain-engineered growth of TMDCs. Therefore, a route toward development of large-area strained TMDCs on a practical substrate is highly desirable. Significant research efforts have been made to realize large area TMDCs, with the majority of efforts focusing on chemical vapor deposition (CVD) 11 , 12 , 13 . Interestingly, a number of studies employing CVD growth of 2D materials have reported apparent strain in the synthesized samples 14 ,
15 . However, growth of high-quality 2D materials with controllable built-in strain has not been realized. Hence, properties that are difficult to probe via mechanical bending experiments, such as low-temperature optical measurements and electrical performance, have yet to be explored. In this work, we demonstrate strain engineering of 2D materials directly via CVD growth while simultaneously maintaining high material quality, by utilizing the thermal coefficient of expansion (TCE) mismatch between the TMDC and the growth substrate. Electron diffraction of strained monolayers grown directly onto transmission electron microscopy (TEM) windows is utilized to unambiguously quantify strain. Using WSe 2
as a model system, we show that it is possible to obtain both tensile (of ~ 1%) and compressive (0.2%) strained 2D semiconductors over large areas on rigid substrates. Furthermore, in the WSe 2
model system we show indirect-to-direct optical transition in tensile strained WSe 2
bilayers as well as removal of dark exciton quenching in WSe 2
monolayers. Results TCE-mismatch induced strain Owing to the high growth temperatures used to synthesize TMDCs, the TCE mismatch between the substrate and the 2D semiconductor can be utilized to control the strain in the synthesized 2D material, as shown schematically in Fig.  1 . The theoretical upper limit for the strain, assuming no relaxation, can be calculated using the difference in lattice constant of the substrate and 2D semiconductor at room temperature and synthesis temperature: $$\varepsilon \left( {{T_{\rm{g}}}} \right) = \frac{{{a_{2{\rm{D}}}}\left( {{T_{\rm{g}}}} \right) - {a_{2{\rm{D}}}}\left( {25\,^\circ {\rm{C}}} \right)}}{{{a_{2{\rm{D}}}}\left( {25\,^\circ {\rm{C}}} \right)}} - \frac{{{a_{{\rm{Sub}}}}\left( {{T_{\rm{g}}}} \right) - {a_{{\rm{Sub}}}}\left( {25\,^\circ {\rm{C}}} \right)}}{{{a_{{\rm{Sub}}}}\left( {25\,^\circ {\rm{C}}} \right)}}$$

To retain the strain generated from TCE-mismatch, the bonding between the 2D layer and the substrate must be sufficiently strong and corrugated to maintain the nonslip condition that transmits strain to the layer. Although one expects strains of this magnitude to arise during epitaxial growth, it is difficult to see how a similar strain can arise for films bound by van der Waals forces to an amorphous substrate. Experimentally, the corrugation in the film must be large enough to retain the strain upon cooling. To estimate the magnitude of the corrugation necessary to sustain the strain, we analyzed a 2D Frenkel–Kontorova model 16 , shown in Supplementary Note  1
and Supplementary Fig.  1 . This model suggests that atomic binding energy variations of as little as 14 meV over the range of the unit cell are capable of retaining strains of the magnitude of those observed experimentally. This variation is ~ 1% of a typical covalent bond strength, and very near to the typical strength of a van der Waals bond. Though a more detailed theory needs to be developed, especially to understand the surface chemistry immediately prior to growth to determine the nature of the bonding, this simple analysis suggests that thermal-expansion mismatch can strain a film, even in the case of weak binding between the film and the substrate. It should be noted that in a previous study, local heating of MoS 2
using a laser was used to generate strains of up to 0.2% arising from the TCE-mismatch of MoS 2
with the substrate 17 . Although this method does not generate built-in strains (strain is released once the laser is turned off), it suggests that the MoS 2 -substrate bonding is strong enough to enable TCE-mismatched induced strain engineering 17 . To demonstrate strain-engineered CVD growth of WSe 2 , four substrates were chosen, which have a range of TCEs. Fused silica and aluminum nitride (AlN) have a TCE of 0.55 and 5.5 ppm, respectively, much smaller than that of WSe 2
(9.5 ± 3.2 ppm), and would be expected to induce tensile strain 3 ,
18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 . In contrast, sapphire has a TCE closely matched to WSe 2
and would be expected to produce relaxed samples and strontium titanate (STO) with a TCE of 12 ppm should yield compressively strained samples 20 ,
23 ,
24 . The sample was rapidly quenched after growth to limit relaxation in the WSe 2 . It is important to note that the rapid quenching process was found to be important in maintaining the presence of strain, and delay of the quenching step can result in partial relaxation of the 2D material. Characterization strain and material quality To characterize the strain present in the as-grown material, multiple characterization methods were utilized. First, electron diffraction was performed on WSe 2
as-grown on SiO 2
TEM grids and WSe 2
transferred to SiO 2
TEM grids. The resulting diffraction patterns are shown in Figs.  2a–c . In all TEM diffraction measurements on WSe 2 , the camera length and lens aberrations of the imaging systems were calibrated using polycrystalline aluminum and single crystal aluminum calibration samples (Ted Pella), and the microscope lens settings were left constant for all subsequent measurements. Corresponding images and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the samples in Figs.  2b, c
are shown in Supplementary Fig.  2 . By comparing the lattice constant extracted from the diffraction patterns of strained (as-grown) and unstrained (transferred) WSe 2 , and utilizing the center of mass for 75 diffraction spots from each pattern, we calculate that a 1.39 ± 0.28% tensile strain is present in the as-grown sample. The calculated error represents the standard deviation in lattice constant value over 75 measured diffraction spots. Raman spectrum shown in Fig.  2d
reveals a shift of the E’ in-plane Raman mode of 1.5 ± 0.2 cm −1
between as-grown and transferred WSe 2 . We note that the strain measured here is biaxial, not uniaxial, in contrast to mechanical bending studies and thus we do not observe splitting of the E′ mode. Therefore, the theoretically calculated value for the Grüneisen parameter (﻿ χ ﻿) of WSe 2
is used to calculate the expected peak shift according to:
\(\omega \left( \varepsilon \right) = {\omega _0} + {\rm{\chi}}\varepsilon\) , which is consistent with the approximately 1% tensile strain measured via diffraction 25 , 26 , 27 . It should also be noted that after transfer the E’ mode shows no shift relative to samples prepared either by exfoliation or as-grown on sapphire. High resolution Raman mapping was performed and is shown in Figs.  2e, f
for WSe 2
crystals as-grown on fused silica and transferred to a new fused silica substrate, respectively. We observe a uniform Raman shift throughout the full WSe 2
domain for both samples indicating that the strain is uniformly distributed within the sample on the scale of the Raman spot size. In addition, PL and atomic force microscopy images of as-grown WSe 2
on fused silica are shown in Supplementary Fig.  3 . Fig. 2 Transmission electron microscopy images and Raman spectroscopy of monolayer WSe 2 .

PL measurements were employed to measure the bandgap as a function of strain. Figure  3a
shows PL spectra of samples grown on all substrates investigated in this work as well as an exfoliated reference. There is a large spectral shift of 120 meV between samples grown on fused silica with near zero TCE and STO, which has the highest TCE of all substrates investigated in this work. Figure  3b
shows the estimated strain from the PL peak shift as a function of predicted strain in WSe 2 , vs. the lattice mismatch between the substrate and TMDC lattice constant. Strain values are determined from the experimentally measured PL peak position (measurement error was calculated using the standard deviation of strain measured from fifteen different crystals) and theoretically calculated bandgap as a function of strain extracted from refs
3 ,
27 . It is important to note that we utilized the difference in peak position relative to an unstrained sample to eliminate effects from absolute bandgap error relative to theoretical calculations. We performed an analysis of the expected strain due to lattice parameter misfit (Supplementary Table  1
and Supplementary Note  2 ) to rule out the influence of epitaxial strain between the substrate and WSe 2 . From this calculation, the expected strain from the lattice mismatch shows the opposite trend as compared with what we observe experimentally. We find that our experimentally realized strain per ΔTCE of −0.10 ± 0.01% per ppm K −1
is in excellent agreement with the theoretical value of −0.09% per ppm K −1 . To verify that the substrate does not affect the PL peak shape or position of monolayer WSe 2 , samples were transferred to the four substrates used in this study (Supplementary Fig.  4 ) and no shift of the PL peak was observed. The impact of growth temperature to tune the strain was also studied using fused silica as the substrate. Figure  3c
shows the tensile strain in monolayer WSe 2
grown at different temperatures, estimated using PL peak position. We are able to tune the strain from 0.94 ± 0.06% to 0.67 ± 0.05% as the growth temperature is changed from 900 to 673 °C. PL spectra corresponding to Fig.  3c
is shown in Supplementary Fig.  5 . Fig. 3 Strain engineering of 2D materials.

Tensile strain engineering of mono- and bilayer WSe 2
Calibrated PL measurements were used to provide a gauge of material quality. We find that strained WSe 2
monolayers as-grown on fused silica show comparable PL intensity to exfoliated WSe 2 , demonstrating that strain engineering of 2D materials can be achieved without compromising material performance. Specifically, as exfoliated samples show a typical quantum yield (QY) of 2.3 ± 0.4%, while samples grown on fused silica show a typical QY of 1.9 ± 0.6%. Upon transfer, the strain within the as-grown material is released and its emission peak shifts to 1.65 eV, closely matching that of exfoliated samples, as shown in Fig.  4a . In addition to emission, the absorption spectrum of the as-grown monolayer was measured and is shown in Fig.  4b . The absorption spectra clearly shows that the A and B exciton resonances are red-shifted with the presence of tensile strain, and are consistent with the observed shift in the emission. Interestingly, the absorption of the C exciton peak shows no shift between the as-grown and exfoliated samples, which is consistent with previously reported mechanical bending experiments on exfoliated monolayers, although it should be noted that in these experiments the strain was uniaxial 28 .

More interestingly, it has been previously demonstrated using bending experiments that under the application of a uniaxial strain of ~ 1.5%, bilayer WSe 2
undergoes an indirect-to-direct bandgap transition 7 . This effect is caused by an increase in the energy level of the indirect valley at the Σ point as well as a corresponding decrease in the energy level of the direct valley at the K point 7 . While it is important to note these results are obtained under uniaxial strain, similar trends between uniaxial and biaxial strain have been observed in theoretical studies on other 2D material systems 29 . Figure  4c
depicts the PL spectra of as-grown, exfoliated and transferred bilayer WSe 2 . In the as-grown strained bilayer, we observe a single sharp PL peak, as oppose to a broader spectrum corresponding to emission from both the indirect and direct bandgaps observed in the unstrained exfoliated and transferred samples. Moreover, the intensity of the PL is reduced by approximately 50 times upon transfer and resultant release of tensile strain as shown in Fig.  4c . This phenomenon can possibly be attributed to the optical transition from indirect-to-direct in bilayer WSe 2
in the presence of tensile strain. This is in good agreement with previous reports on the indirect-to-direct optical transition of WSe 2
through bending experiments, although these previous studies utilized uniaxial strain 7 . The normalized PL spectra for bilayer WSe 2
grown on fused silica after transfer, as well as unstrained samples grown on sapphire and prepared by exfoliation, are shown in Supplementary Fig.  6
and show a very similar spectral shape. Absorption of WSe 2
bilayer samples was also measured and is shown in Fig.  4d . To further characterize WSe 2
monolayers, we performed low-temperature PL measurements. Numerous studies have experimentally observed that the PL of monolayer WSe 2
is quenched at reduced temperatures. This behavior is unusual for a direct bandgap semiconductor and has been attributed to the formation of dark excitons with an energy level ~ 30 meV below the bright state 30 ,
31 . It has been hypothesized that at low temperatures the bright exciton is allowed to relax to the lower energy level resulting in a reduction of the PL QY. Conversely, both theoretical and experimental studies have suggested that unstrained monolayer WSe 2
is an indirect-gap semiconductor, with a small (< 3kT) energy difference between the indirect and direct gaps 32 ,
33 . Upon cooling of exfoliated monolayer WSe 2
samples, we observe results similar to what has been previously reported as shown in the inset of Fig.  5a , which is a reduction in PL emission at low temperatures. However, for the case of tensile strained monolayer WSe 2
as-grown on fused silica we observe the opposite trend (Fig.  5 ). As the temperature is reduced from 300 to 6 K the PL intensity increases by over an order of magnitude, resulting in a final PL QY of 14% as shown in Fig.  5d . The nature of the physical mechanism for the dramatic difference in the temperature-dependent behavior can be directly attributed to band structure modification due to the presence of strain. However, it remains unclear if this is due to an indirect-to-direct bandgap transition or an increase in the energy level of the dark state.

Discussion In summary, we have demonstrated controlled and stable strain engineering of 2D materials by growth, realized through TCE mismatch between the substrate and 2D material. The demonstrated strain engineering allows for dramatic modulation of the physical properties of 2D materials. Using WSe 2
as a model system, we have achieved a strain induced indirect-to-direct optical transition in directly grown WSe 2
bilayer, resulting in an amplification of the PL intensity by over fifty times. We have also shown tunable PL emission of WSe 2
monolayer, whereas maintaining its high performance. Notably, in the monolayer case under tensile strain, we observed increasing luminescence at reduced temperatures, in stark contrast with what has been reported in the unstrained exfoliated material, suggesting that strain can be utilized to brighten the dark exciton. This practical route for the direct realization of strain engineering in 2D materials can allow for the characterization of device properties as a function of strain as well as enable optical measurements that are not accessible to samples strained by physical bending or stretching. Our work depicts that biaxial strains of 1% tensile to 0.2% compressive can be obtained by using readily achievable differences in the thermal expansion coefficients by choosing an appropriate growth substrate. By expanding upon this method, it may be possible to obtain uniaxial strain via growth on substrates with anisotropic thermal expansion coefficients or obtain significantly higher strain values via growth on piezoelectric substrates 34 ,
35 . Methods Material growth WSe 2
was grown on several substrates with varying thermal expansion coefficients using CVD. Specifically, growth was performed on fused silica (amorphous), aluminum nitride (c-plane), Sapphire (c-plane), or strontium titanate (<100>); all substrates were electronic grade and have a root mean square surface roughness of <10 Å. Substrates were first cleaned by sonication in acetone and isopropyl alcohol for 10 min. The growth was carried out using a two-heating-zone furnace (DaePoong Industry, 50602); a schematic of the growth setup is shown in Supplementary Fig.  7 . The cleaned substrates were loaded into the downstream zone, and a ceramic boat containing mixture of WO 3
and potassiu﻿m bromide (KBr) was then placed next to the substrates. KBr was mixed with WO 3
at a ratio of 1:2, with the KBr acting as a promoter for the growth. This is similar to methods described in ref.
36 . However, we found that several salts can be used and the choice of promoter has a significant role in determining the ultimate sample morphology (this is further discussed in the  Supplementary Methods ). It should be noted that regardless of the promoter used, the strain present in the sample was unaffected as shown in Supplementary Fig.  8 . A ceramic boat containing 500 mg Se powder was placed in the center of the upstream zone. After loading, the quartz tube was evacuated and Ar was introduced at 60 sccm resulting in a pressure of 2.6 Torr. The temperature of upstream zone was then ramped to 100 °C and the downstream furnace was subsequently ramped to a setpoint of 825 °C. The set point of the upstream zone was adjusted such that the residual heat from the downstream zone results in vaporization of Se. Once the temperature of downstream furnace was stabilized, hydrogen was introduced at a flow rate of 40 sccm (total pressure of 3 Torr). This initiates the growth as the presence of hydrogen is required to decompose and vaporize WO x
37 . The growth time used was 15 min. Once the growth is complete, hydrogen flow was stopped, and the furnace was opened to rapidly cool the sample. The influence of the H 2 /Ar ratio, growth time and growth pressure is discussed in the  Supplementary Methods
and are shown in Supplementary Figs  9 – 11 . Optical microscope images of samples grown on various substrates is shown in Supplementary Fig.  12 . Specific growth conditions were tuned to optimize the PL QY of the as-grown samples and to either promote growth of bilayer or monolayer domains (discussed in  Supplementary Methods ). It should be noted that for growths where the substrate temperature was varied the WO 3 /KBr boat was placed in the center of the first heating zone and the Se boat was placed at the edge of the first heating zone. The substrates were placed in the center of the second heating zone. The position of Se boat was adjusted to control the temperature. Transfer of grown WSe 2
is done using a HF based wet transfer technique with PMMA as the transfer medium using the specific procedure described in ref.
11 . The electrical performance of CVD WSe 2
grown on fused silica and transferred to Si/SiO 2
is also compared to that of exfoliated samples, and is shown in Supplementary Fig.  13 . Transmission electron microscopy WSe 2
monolayers were directly grown and transferred on 8 nm thick SiO 2
membranes (Ted Pella) for electron diffraction measurements in order to directly measure the lattice constant of the strained and unstrained samples, respectively. Electron diffraction measurements were performed at the National Center for Electron Microscopy at LBNL using a FEI Titan 60–300 microscope operated at 80 kV with parallel beam illumination. Optical characterization The PL data presented in this work was obtained using a custom built micro-PL instrument described in detail in ref.
1 . In brief, measurements were performed using the continuous wave 514.5 nm line of an Ar +
laser (Lexel 95) and the laser power was adjusted using neutral density filters. The laser was focused on the sample using an 80 × objective lens (NA = 0.9). The PL signal was measured using the same objective lens, passed through a 550 nm dielectric longpass filter, dispersed by a
f  = 340 mm spectrometer with a 150 g mm −1
grating, and detected using by an Si CCD camera (Andor iDus BEX2-DD). Prior to each measurement the CCD background was obtained and subsequently subtracted from the PL acquisition. The sensitivity of the instrument as a function of wavelength (instrument function) was determined through measurement of a virtual Lambertian blackbody source under the objective, created by imaging the illumination from a temperature stabilized lamp (ThorLabs SLS201) on a diffuse reflector (Spectralon). The system efficiency was determined by measuring the response of the excitation laser focused onto a diffuse reflector (Spectralon), with the 550 nm longpass filter removed. The measured external quantum efficiency was converted to QY using sample absorption at the pump wavelength and the fraction of light, which is able to escape the sample (1/4 n
2 , where
n
is the refractive index of the medium). All measurements shown in this work were performed at an incident power of 1.5 W cm −2
(corresponding to a laser power of 200 nW). This laser power is significantly below the onset of biexcitonic recombination in WSe 2
38 . Low temperature measurements were performed using a long working distance 50 × objective lens in a micro-cryostat (Janis) with an infrasil window. The procedure described previously was used to calculate the sample PL efficiency. PL imaging was performed on the samples to determine their uniformity. Measurements were performed using a florescence microscopy setup using a 470 nm light emitting diode as the excitation source and a CCD detector (Andor Luca). Raman measurements and high-resolution mapping were performed to characterize the strain in the WSe 2 . Raman spectra were obtained using a WITec Alpha 300RA equipped with a piezo electric scanning stage. The sample was excited using the 532 nm line of a frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser as the excitation source and focused on the sample using a 100 × objective.

Abstract
Antisolvent methods – solvent engineering and a Lewis base adduct approach – are the most used methods to prepare highly efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs). These two methods differ only by the ratio between the perovskite (PVSK) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). In this study, the difference between these two methods and the effect of relative humidity (rH) on the crystallization process were evaluated by
in situ
Grazing-Incidence Wide Angle X-ray Scattering ( in situ
GIWAXS) using synchrotron radiation. The technique was applied to the first stages of formation of formamidinium-based perovskite films, under real preparation conditions of spin coating, and at different humidity conditions and time windows to inject the antisolvent. The higher amount of DMSO in the solvent engineering method prolongs the duration of the colloidal gel, which extends the time window for antisolvent injection and, as a consequence, facilitates obtaining films with a homogeneous morphology. Our results confirm that the formation of a cesium/formamidinium-based perovskite takes place through the conversion of 2H–4H hexagonal polytypes directly to a black perovskite without thermal annealing, independent of the rH or method employed. In contrast, a cesium-free, methylammonium/formamidinium-based perovskite follows the 2H–4H–6H polytype sequence. Interestingly, at higher amounts of DMSO and rH (40%), a pure iodide intermediate (MA 2 Pb 3 I 8 ·2DMSO) is formed in the cesium-free perovskite, which is undesirable in mixed halide perovskites. Our findings shed new light on the complexity of PVSK film formation, by identifying all crystalline phases in the process, and give clues to manage the composition and environment during film processing, and thus have an impact on efficiency optimization and solar cell manufacturing.

Abstract Improving the intrinsic film quality of metal halide perovskites is very critical to increase the power conversion efficiency and long-term stability of perovskite solar cells. Here we report a multifunctional, non-volatile additive that can be used to modulate the kinetics of perovskite film growth through a hydrogen-bond-bridged intermediate phase. The additive enables the formation of large perovskite grains and coherent grain growth from bottom to the surface of the film. The enhanced film morphology results in significantly reduced non-radiative recombinations, thus boosting the power conversion efficiency of inverted (p–i–n) solar cells to 24.8% (24.5% certified) with a low energy loss of 0.36 eV. The unencapsulated devices exhibit improved thermal stability with a
T 98
lifetime beyond 1,000 h under continuous heating at 65 ± 5 °C in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. This effective approach can also be applied to wide-bandgap perovskites and large-area devices to show reduced voltage loss and high efficiency.

Main Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have garnered great attention due to their impressive optoelectronic properties 1 . Combining compositional and interfacial engineering strategies, the record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) has now reached 25.7% (ref.
2 ) ( https://www.nrel.gov/pv/cell-efficiency.html ). However, the reported high-efficiency devices mostly comprise the conventional (n–i–p) architecture 3 , 4 , 5 , whereas inverted (p–i–n) PVSCs still show inferior performance despite their low-temperature processability and better compatibility in fabricating tandem and flexible devices 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 . The major challenge stems from the severe energy loss in inverted PVSCs, especially the non-radiative recombination loss associated with defects embedded at the interfaces and grain boundaries 11 . A high-quality perovskite film with intrinsically low defect density is, thus, critical in determining the achievable efficiency and stability for PVSCs 12 . In a typical one-step solution process, perovskite precursors dissolved in polar aprotic solvents are spin coated onto the substrate. The introduction of an antisolvent then quickly extracts the residual solvents and templates the perovskite crystal growth through intermediate phases 13 . Various volatile solvents and organic salts have been employed as additives to tune the intermediate compositions for modulating the crystallization kinetics 14 , 15 , 16 . In one work,
N -methyl-2-pyrrolidone was added in the perovskite precursors to form a lead iodide (PbI 2 )– N -methyl-2-pyrrolidone adduct for promoting the black-phase formation at room temperature 15 . In another work, methylammonium chloride (MACl) was used to facilitate the formation of an intermediate phase for stabilizing the perovskite α-phase 16 . However, these additives may volatilize during annealing, creating voids at the perovskite–substrate interface, inducing unavoidable recombination loss and fast degradation of the perovskite 17 . Here we report the formation of a hydrogen-bond-bridged intermediate by adding a multifunctional molecule (4-guanidinobenzoic acid hydrochloride (GBAC)) into the perovskite precursor to modulate the crystallization kinetics and serve as an effective non-volatile passivation linker in the annealed film. Combining crystallography, in situ photoluminescence (PL) characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we reveal that the crystal growth kinetics is regulated by additional energies required for hydrogen-bond breakage and cation exchange between the intermediate phase and perovskite. Therefore, the obtained perovskite films exhibit significantly enhanced crystallinity with larger grains. Besides, the additives can form tight packs at the grain boundaries due to π–π interaction of the aryls to effectively passivate the defects in perovskites. The derived inverted PVSCs achieved a champion PCE of 24.8% with an open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 1.19 V, short-circuit current density ( J SC ) of 24.55 mA cm –2
and fill factor (FF) of 84.78%. A certified PCE of 24.5% was obtained from the Japan Electrical Safety & Environment Technology Laboratories, being among the highest reported for inverted PVSCs (Supplementary Table
1 ). We also applied this strategy to fabricate wide-bandgap and large-area PVSCs, paving the way for developing multijunction and scalable perovskite photovoltaics. Characterization of perovskite films We introduced GBAC as an additive into the perovskite precursor solution, which can interact with the uncoordinated lead and organic–inorganic vacancies via Lewis acid–base reactions with the carboxyl and guanidium groups 18 . To verify our hypothesis, we first conducted Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry to study the interactions between GBAC and organic species in perovskites. As shown in Fig.
1a
and Supplementary Fig.
1 , the N–H stretching peak shifted from 3,352 to 3,378 cm −1
for FA + /MA +
and the C=N stretching peak in FA +
also shifted from 1,713 to 1,709 cm −1
on adding GBAC, suggesting the formation of hydrogen bonds between GBAC and organic cations 19 . These indicate that the interplay between GBAC and FA + /MA +
in the perovskite can help strengthen the film stability, especially thermal stability that is mainly governed by the organic species. We then verified this through a thermogravimetric analysis (Supplementary Fig.
2 ), where the impeded decomposition of the target film suggests that more energy is required to disrupt the interaction between GBAC and perovskite 20 , ameliorating the film’s thermal stability.

f , Statistical distribution of surface potential extracted from the KPFM images. Full size image We performed high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) to study the surface chemistry of perovskites (Supplementary Fig.
3 ). We clearly observed the peak corresponding to GBAC π–π interaction (293.10 eV, C1 s
spectrum) and increased the C=O peak area (O1 s
spectrum) in the target film, further validating the existence of the GBAC linker in the perovskite (Supplementary Figs.
4
and
5 ). In the Pb4 f
spectrum (Fig.
1b ), the binding energy of 4 f 5/2
and 4 f 7/2
for divalent Pb 2+
shifted from 141.92 and 137.09 eV to 141.59 and 136.76 eV, respectively, due to the electrostatic interaction between the guanidium group and PbI 6 4− . We further recorded the steady-state PL and time-resolved PL profiles of perovskite films to reveal how GBAC affects the film quality and charge-transport dynamics (Supplementary Fig.
6 ). The target film exhibits six times stronger PL intensity and three times longer PL lifetime than those of the control film, agreeing well with the FTIR and XPS results that GBAC suppresses the defect-induced non-radiative recombination to reduce energy loss for improving the photovoltaic performance. To understand how GBAC addition affects the film morphology, we collected scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the perovskite films. The target film shows considerably larger grains (~1 μm) and fewer residual PbI 2
sheets than the control film (Fig.
1c,d ), with a coherent bottom-to-surface grain growth that can facilitate the transport of carriers to electrodes. Besides good film morphology, the crystallinity of the target film is significantly improved (Fig.
1e ). The decreased PbI 2
sheets in the SEM images was also confirmed by the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns, suggesting that GBAC can interact with the uncoordinated Pb 2+
and modulate film growth to obtain fully grown grains. Moreover, the addition of GBAC significantly helps modulate the crystal orientation within the film for facilitating charge transport (Supplementary Fig.
7 ). Atomic force microscopy characterization reveals a lower surface roughness after GBAC addition (Supplementary Fig.
8 ). We also applied Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) to evaluate the distribution of the surface potential of perovskite films, which shows an increment of 200–300 mV in the target film (Fig.
1f
and Supplementary Fig.
9 ), indicating a Fermi level ( E F ) closer to the conductive band edge 21 . The higher work function measured by KPFM matches well with the results obtained from ultraviolet photoelectron spectrometry (UPS), showing a 0.25 eV shift in
E F
by adding GBAC (Supplementary Fig.
10 ). The more n-characteristic film surface stems from the modified surface termination after adding GBAC (ref.
22 ), enabling more efficient charge transfer between the perovskite and electron-transporting materials (Supplementary Fig.
11 ). In situ characterization of film formation To gain more insights into the remarkably enhanced film quality, we adopted in situ PL spectrometry to understand the role of GBAC during film formation 23 , 24 , 25 . The evolution of the PL peak position in both control and target films shows similar trends in the long-term stage (0–750 s) (Supplementary Figs.
12 – 14 ). However, the initial peak position of the wet target film was slightly blueshifted compared with that of the control film due to the additional chloride from GBAC (Fig.
2a,b ). Also, the target film exhibits a much slower shift with negligible fluctuation in the initial stage (0–10 s) compared with those of the control sample, implying that the crystallization process was significantly retarded by adding GBAC (Fig.
2b ) 23 . Moreover, the PL peaks of the target film are more symmetric compared with the control film, indicating a more uniform distribution of crystallite sizes, which facilitates the significantly increased grain sizes, as shown in the SEM images (Fig.
1c,d ) 25 . Fig. 2: Comparison of film growth kinetics by in situ PL. a , b , Normalized in situ PL peak position evolution of the control ( a ) and target ( b ) perovskite films.

a . Full size image We then analysed the evolution of PL peak intensity, which shows typical PL quenching in both films but more severe in the control film (Fig.
2c,d ) 24 , 25 . Such PL quenching originates from the continuously increased Urbäch energy, indicating the gradual formation of defects in the microstructures of perovskites 24 . However, it is considerably inhibited in the target film, showing a much lower defect density and better ambient stability than the control film (Fig.
2d ) 26 . The initial stages (0–2 s for the control sample and 0–30 s for the target sample) were then enlarged to clearly show the PL intensity evolution (Fig.
2e,f ). The control film shows a typical four-stage ‘up–down–up–down’ process with two states (Fig.
2e ) 24 . In state ‘I’ (0–200 ms), the perovskite grains grow freely and are well crystallized/ordered, resulting in an increased PL intensity (‘up’). When the solvent is almost entirely evaporated, the perovskite crystallites are exposed to the surrounding atmosphere and the surfaces of other crystallites, forming grain boundaries and triggering rapid PL quenching (‘down’; 200–400 ms). In state ‘II’, the small crystallites further grow and merge into larger ones on annealing to reduce the overall grain boundaries, resulting in an increased PL intensity again (‘up’; 400–600 ms). Such a rapid film formation can also be attributed to the absorbed moisture accumulated within the grain boundaries, inducing grain-boundary creep and subsequent merging of adjacent grains to accelerate the film growth 27 . The partial recovery of PL intensity also comes from the passivation effect of excessive PbI 2
at the perovskite grain boundaries 28 . Eventually, the film is vulnerable under ambient conditions and prone to decomposition. This results in a stabilized but almost one order of magnitude lower PL intensity than that of PL max
(‘down’; after 600 ms). However, adding GBAC introduces an extra stage involving the intermediate-induced pre-growth process in the target sample (Fig.
2f ) 24 , 25 . The film formation is significantly slowed down, reaching its maximum PL intensity at ~20 s and maintained for longer time. These results imply that adding GBAC can modulate the crystallization kinetics by forming an additional intermediate to enhance the film quality, leading to larger grain sizes and high crystallinity. Film growth with hydrogen-bond-bridged intermediate To study the GBAC-induced intermediate phase, we grew the single crystal of GBAC–PbI 2 – N , N -dimethylformamide (DMF) (Supplementary Table
2 ) 29 . We observed strong cyclic hydrogen bonds between the carboxylic acid and guanidium groups as well as DMF and guanidium groups (Fig.
3a ). The DMF molecules locked by hydrogen bonds help isolate the PbI 2
sheets and GBAC layer, leading to a one-dimensional organic–inorganic hybrid chain structure. Due to the strong dipole of GBAC and the electron delocalization in the guanidium groups (Supplementary Fig.
15 ), these hydrogen bonds are very different from the typical linear hydrogen-bonded chains that serve as supramolecular synthons for layered perovskite structures 30 . This unique interaction mode helps build a bridge to connect the organic–inorganic components. Moreover, the interaction between GBAC and perovskite precursor components in solution was investigated by
1 H nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry (Supplementary Fig.
16 ), of which the results are in good agreement with those observed from XPS and FTIR measurements 7 . Through these studies, we have identified that GBAC can simultaneously interact with the solvent, organic and inorganic components in the precursor solution through both Coulomb interaction and hydrogen bonding, demonstrating its multifunctionality in solution.

e , Schematic of the GBAC-assisted film growth. The brown arrows represent the breakage of hydrogen bonds, and the green arrows represent the cation exchange. Full size image We then conducted a thermal analysis of single crystals to study the phase transition from the intermediate state to perovskite. The experimental XRD pattern of the obtained transparent GBAC–PbI 2 –DMF crystals matches well with the XRD pattern simulated from the single-crystal structure, confirming their composition (Supplementary Fig.
17 ). The simultaneous thermal analysis profile shows an intense endothermic peak at ~80 °C corresponding to hydrogen-bond breakage (Supplementary Fig.
18 ). At elevated temperatures, DMF starts to evaporate, destabilizing the intermediate that then transforms into a new one-dimensional structure composed of GBAC–PbI 2
(Fig.
3b
and Supplementary Fig.
19 ). This GBAC–PbI 2
phase can only be identified in a perovskite film with >4 mol% GBAC dosage (Supplementary Figs.
20
and
21 ), where a small dosage of GBAC, in turn, functions as a passivation linker anchoring at the grain boundaries to reduce the defect density and enhance the film stability with its rigid stacking 8 . To understand the impact of such hydrogen-bond-bridged intermediate on film growth, periodic DFT calculations were performed to understand if GBAC +
can spontaneously exchange with FA +
during the crystallization process. Due to the substantial hydrogen bonding, the formation energy of this intermediate (GBAC–PbI 2 –DMF) (–18.58 eV) is much lower than that of δ-FAPbI 3
(–10.60 eV). Such extra stabilization is not thermodynamically favourable for crystal growth, since extra energy is required to enable the cation exchange between GBAC +
and FA +
(ref.
31 ). During the subsequent thermal annealing, the hydrogen bonds in the GBAC–PbI 2 –DMF phase were broken to form GBAC–PbI 2
with an energy of −11.85 eV (Fig.
3c ). Although this significantly reduced energy barrier (1.25 eV) is easier to overcome, it will still hinder the free exchange between GBAC +
and FA + , thereby slowing down the crystallization process 32 . In addition to thermodynamic control, the nucleation rate mediated by kinetic control can also be altered by increasing the activation energy of cation exchange 33 . Compared with the Lewis acid–base adduct formed between PbI 2
and DMF (−0.79 eV) (Fig.
3d ), the stronger ionic bonding between GBAC and PbI 2
(−1.16 eV) will cost extra energy to overcome the saddling point (Supplementary Figs.
22
and
23 ) 34 , 35 . Moreover, based on the Arrhenius equation, the inherent nucleation and growth kinetics originating from the high volatility of DMF and strong FA–precursor binding to DMF (−1.00 eV) (ref.
36 ) will also be hindered by the more stable GBAC–PbI 2
phase. Therefore, the crystal growth of the perovskite can be both thermodynamically and kinetically modulated by this hydrogen-bond-bridged intermediate (Supplementary Fig.
24 ). Due to the strong interaction between GBAC and perovskite, the retarded film formation would also accumulate GBAC at the bottom interface (Supplementary Fig.
25 ). Eventually, rigidly stacked GBAC can form at the grain boundaries due to π–π interaction after DMF evaporation, acting as a multifunctional passivation linker to enhance the photovoltaic performance (Fig.
3e ) 8 . Photovoltaic performance The inverted PVSCs with a device configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/((2,7-dimethoxy-9H-carbazol-9-yl) methyl) phosphonic acid (DC-PA) (ref.
21 )/perovskite (with/without GBAC)/C60/bathocuproine/Ag were fabricated to evaluate their photovoltaic performance (Fig.
4a , Supplementary Figs.
26
and
27
and Supplementary Table
3 ). As shown in Fig.
4b , the highest PCE of the control device is 22.8%, with
V OC
of 1.12 V,
J SC
of 24.48 mA cm –2
and FF of 83.01%. However, the champion PCE of the GBAC-treated device can be further improved to 24.8% ( V OC
of 1.19 V,
J SC
of 24.55 mA cm –2
and FF of 84.78%), which is among the highest efficiencies reported so far for inverted PVSCs. The stabilized power output of the target champion device is 24.4%, matching well with the PCEs from the
J – V
measurement (Fig.
4c ). The device performance was also validated at an independent laboratory (Japan Electrical Safety & Environment Technology Laboratories) to show a certified PCE of 24.5% ( V OC  = 1.19 V,
J SC  = 24.45 mA cm –2
and FF = 84.20%) (Supplementary Fig.
28 ). The integrated photocurrent (24.38 mA cm –2 ) from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum also matches well with the values obtained from the
J – V
measurements (Fig.
4d ). The bandgap of the perovskite is 1.55 eV, as obtained by calculating the EQE derivative (Supplementary Fig.
29 ). Benefiting from the enhanced film quality and defect passivation aided by GBAC, the average
V OC
value was boosted from 1.12 to 1.18 V (Fig.
4e ). The overall energy loss of the champion target device can be reduced to 0.36 eV, which is very close to that of GaAs photovoltaics and represents one of the lowest energy losses in high-PCE cases (Fig.
4f ) 37 , 38 . DFT calculations investigated the typical
I Pb
antisite defect on a PbI 2 -terminated surface, revealing that GBAC passivation can help reduce these deep-level charge-carrier traps (Supplementary Fig.
30 ). The trap density was reduced from 2.58 × 10 16
to 1.53 × 10 16  cm −3
after adding GBAC, further demonstrating the effectiveness of this strategy (Supplementary Fig.
31 ). Fig. 4: Characterization of photovoltaic performance and stability of PVSCs. a , Device architecture of the inverted PVSC.

Full size image Since adding GBAC can modulate crystallization to improve the film quality, this strategy can also be explored for fabricating large-area PVSCs (Supplementary Fig.
32 ). As shown in Fig.
4g , a large-area device (1.008 cm 2 ) delivered a PCE of 22.7% ( V OC  = 1.18 V,
J SC  = 24.83 mA cm –2 , FF = 77.43%), which is also one of the highest efficiencies reported for similar-sized PVSCs (Supplementary Table
4 ). Besides, the
V OC
and
J SC
values of this device are comparable with those obtained in small-area devices, showing great promise for device upscaling (Supplementary Fig.
33
and Supplementary Table
5 ). To demonstrate the general applicability of this approach to different perovskite compositions, we also fabricated devices based on a larger-bandgap perovskite (1.78 eV). The average PCE showed an increase from 15.70% to 16.61%, with average
V OC
improvement from 1.19 to 1.25 V, which is highly favourable for fabricating tandem photovoltaics (Supplementary Fig.
34 ). Finally, we investigated the stability of devices under an accelerated aging condition based on the recognized protocols 39 . Unencapsulated devices were aged under continuous heating at 65 ± 5 °C (under N 2 ). The target device showed a very small PCE decay (<3%) after 1,200 h, whereas that of the control device decreased nearly 30% during the same period (Fig.
4h ). This shows that the interaction between GBAC and organic components (MA/FA) helps strengthen the film to avoid severe decomposition and sublimation under heating (Supplementary Fig.
35 ). The long-term operational stability of the unencapsulated devices was also measured by tracking the true maximum power point under continuous one-sun illumination (Supplementary Fig.
36 ) in a N 2 -filled glovebox. The target device maintained ~90% of its initial PCE after 500 h, whereas that of the control device decreased to ~30% of its original value (Supplementary Fig.
37 ). We also performed time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) measurements to probe the compositional changes and ion migration related to device degradation. The control devices show dramatic changes with ions migrated to the perovskite/ETL interface after aging (Supplementary Fig.
38 ). However, only negligible changes were observed in the target sample aged under the same condition. Such improved device stability can be attributed to the enhanced film morphology and inhibited ion migration by adding GBAC. If GBAC can be used in conjunction with more efficient encapsulation techniques and optimal perovskite compositions, further improved PVSC efficiency and stability can be expected to meet the requirements for practical applications 40 , 41 , 42 . Conclusion In summary, we report an innovative strategy for achieving high-quality and stable perovskite films by employing a multifunctional, non-volatile additive, GBAC, which forms a unique hydrogen-bond-bridged intermediate phase to modulate the perovskite crystallization process and simultaneously functions as an efficient passivation linker. We experimentally and theoretically unveil the mechanism of GBAC in assisting perovskite film formation, providing a design guideline for selecting suitable non-volatile additives to enhance the film quality. The greatly ameliorated optoelectronic properties are attributed to improved film morphology and crystallinity, effective defect passivation and more efficient charge transfer at the more n-characteristic film surface. Consequently, an impressive PCE of 24.8% (24.5% certified), low energy loss (0.36 eV) and remarkable device stability were achieved in inverted PVSCs. Our approach can also be extended to fabricate wide-bandgap perovskite devices and upscale devices, providing a simple and effective way towards fabricating scalable and highly efficient PVSCs. Methods Materials All the materials are used as received without further purification, including DMF (99.99%, J&K), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.70%, J&K), isopropanol (IPA, 99.50%, J&K) and chlorobenzene (CB, 99.90%, J&K). Caesium iodide, caesium bromide, methylammonium iodide, formamidinium iodide (FAI) and formamidinium bromide were bought from Dysol. PbI 2
(99.9985%) and lead bromide (>98.0000%) were bought from TCI. MACl, bathocuproine (99.9%) and C60 were bought from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology. GBAC (99%) was bought from Sigma-Aldrich. Piperazinium iodide 7
and DC-PA (ref.
21 ) were synthesized according to previous reports. Synthesis of GBAC–PbI 2 –DMF single crystals PbI 2
and GBAC (1/1 by molar, 1.0 M) were dissolved in DMF and stirred overnight at 50 °C. The turbid liquid was filtered and transferred into a 4 mL vial. The vial was then placed into a sealed bottle filled with 2 mL CB. The GBAC–PbI 2 –DMF single crystals were grown along with the slow diffusion of the vapour of the antisolvent CB into the solution. Device fabrication ITO glass (15 Ω sq –1 ; 1.5 × 1.5 cm 2
for a regular device and 2.5 × 2.5 cm 2
for a large-area device) was progressively washed by sonication with detergent (Decon 90), deionized water, acetone and IPA for 15 min. The washed ITO glass was dried in a 75 °C oven for over 12 h. Then, the cleaned ITO substrates were subjected to ultraviolet–ozone for 25 min and transformed in a N 2 -filled glovebox for film fabrication. DC-PA (2 mg mL –1
in IPA) was dynamically spin coated onto the cleaned ITO at 3,000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 15 min. The substrates were cooled down to room temperature and washed with pure IPA and then annealed at 100 °C for 5 min. Then, 1.7 M perovskite precursor solutions were constructed by mixing FAI, PbI 2 , methylammonium iodide and caesium iodide in DMF:DMSO mixed solvent (4:1 v:v) with the chemical formula Cs 0.06 MA 0.14 FA 0.80 PbI 3 . Then, 10 mol% MACl was added into the precursor solution. For the target perovskite, 0.8 mol% GBAC was added to the precursor solution, and it was ensured that it is well mixed with the precursor. Then, 50 μL of the prepared precursor solution was spin coated at 1,000 rpm for 10 s and 5,000 rpm for 30 s onto the DC-PA-based ITO substrate; 170 μL CB as the antisolvent was dripped on the film at 10 s before the end of the last procedure and then annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. After deposition of the perovskite active layer, 50 μL piperazinium iodide (0.4 mg mL –1
in IPA) solution was spin coated onto the film at 5,000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 100 °C for 5 min. For the wide-bandgap perovskite, 1.2 M precursor solution with the chemical formula Cs 0.2 FA 0.8 Pb(I 0.6 Br 0.4 ) 3
was prepared from FAI, caesium iodide, formamidinium bromide, caesium bromide, PbI 2
and lead bromide, and then dissolved in DMF:DMSO mixed solvents (4:1 v:v). Then, 5 mol% excess of PbI 2
and 5 mol% MACl were added into the precursor solution. The target perovskite with 0.5 mol% GBAC was spin coated onto the DC-PA/ITO substrates at 5,000 rpm with an accelerating speed of 1,500 rpm for 30 s. Then, 150 μL CB as the antisolvent was dripped on the film at 15 s before the ending and then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The films were then cooled down to room temperature and readied for thermal evaporation. Subsequently, 25 nm C60, 8 nm bathocuproine and 100 nm Ag electrode were sequentially evaporated under a high vacuum (<4 × 10 −6  torr). Characterizations The
1 H nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were collected on a Bruker AVANCE III HD 300 MHz spectrometer in a DMSO-d6 solution with tetramethylsilane as a reference. The morphology of the samples was recorded by an SEM instrument (Philips XL30 FEG). Steady-state PL and time-resolved PL spectrum were obtained with an FLS980 spectrofluorometer (Edinburgh) with a pulsed excitation laser of 485 nm. The XPS and UPS characterization measurements were conducted in a VG ESCALAB 220i XL surface analysis system equipped with a He-discharge lamp ( hv  = 21.22 eV) and a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray gun ( hv  = 1,486.60 eV), respectively. ToF-SIMS (ION TOF-SIMS5) data were analysed with the positive mode (Bi) under 30 keV (1.00 pA) with an area of 100 × 100 μm 2 . The sputter parameters for the device are O 2
under 1 keV (100 nA) with an area of 300 × 300 μm 2 , and the sputter parameters for the film sample is gas cluster ion beam ion gun under 10 keV (10 nA) with an area of 800 × 800 μm 2 . XRD characterization was conducted on a D2 Phaser instrument with Cu Kα (wavelength, 1.5418 Å) radiation. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering measurements were conducted using a Xeuss 2.0 SAXS/WAXS laboratory beamline with a Cu X-ray source (8.05 keV, 1.54 Å) and a Pilatus 3R 300 K detector. The incidence angle is 1.0°. In situ PL spectra were characterized with home-built equipment. An excitation laser (315 nm) was introduced to the sample through a fibre, and the PL spectra were detected by using a detector connected to an Ocean Optics USB2000. PL mapping was collected using a WITec alpha300 M+ confocal microscope. The excitation laser was a diode-pumped solid-state laser (532 nm, Cobolt Laser). The
J – V
characteristics were measured in a N 2 -filled glovebox by a Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm −2 ) irradiation using an Enlitech SS-F5 solar simulator. The light intensity was calibrated using a silicon solar cell (with a KG-2 filter) from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The device areas are 0.040 cm 2
for regular devices and 1.008 cm 2
for the large-size device, both of which are determined by metal aperture masks. A 150-nm-thick magnesium fluoride layer was deposited on the back of the glass before measurements. The EQE values were collected by an Enlitech EQE measurement system. A silicon solar cell calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory was used to obtain the AM 1.5 G solar simulator’s light intensity. The devices used for the stability test had the same structure as that for the
J – V
test. For thermal stability characterization, the devices were aged on a hotplate at 65 ± 5 °C in a N 2 -filled glovebox and cooled down to room temperature before the
J – V
test. For maximum power point tracking, the devices were tracked through the high-throughput solar-cell lifetime test system from CRYSCO with maximum power point tracking under light-emitting-diode-simulated AM 1.5 G spectrum. The light source is a superluminescent diode with a range from 400 to 1,000 nm. The superluminescent diode source is equipped with a silicon photoelectric probe to monitor the change in light intensity and automatically adjust the intensity with the control of the host. The intensity of the superluminescent diode source can be adjusted from 0.1 to 1.2 kW m –2 . The duration between the two tests is 300 s. Single-crystal analysis The single-crystal structure of GBAC–PbI 2 –DMF was resolved and refined using the Bruker SHELXTL-2016/6 software package. All the non-hydrogen atoms were anisotropically refined, and all the hydrogen atoms were refined as riding atoms. The crystal data and data collection and refinement parameters are listed in Supplementary Table
1 . Also, CCDC 2141303 contains the supplementary crystallographic data of GBAC–PbI 2 –DMF, which can be obtained free of charge from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre via
www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif . DFT calculations First-principles calculations based on DFT were performed with the Vienna ab initio simulation package 43 , using the generalized gradient approximation of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional 44
for the exchange–correlation functional. Valence–core electron interactions were treated with the projector-augmented wave method 45 . We employed Grimme’s DFT-D3 scheme to include the van der Waals interactions 45 , and dipole correction for slab calculations 46 . The cutoff energy of plane-wave expansions was set at 500 eV and the Hellmann–Feynman forces acting on atoms were converged below 0.01 eV Å −1
for all the calculations. For the calculation of binding energies (defined as
\(E_{{{{\mathrm{PbI}}}}_2 - {{{\mathrm{molecule}}}}} - E_{{{{\mathrm{PbI}}}}_2} - E_{{{{\mathrm{molecule}}}}}\) ), 1 × 1 × 1 Γ-centred
k -point grid was adopted, and the convergence criteria for the electronic wave function was 1.0 × 10 −6  eV energy difference. For geometry optimizations and energy calculations, 4 × 4 × 4 Γ-centred
k -point mesh for δ-FAPbI 3 , 2 × 4 × 2 Γ-centred
k -point mesh for GBAC–PbI 2 –DMF, 3 × 4 × 2 δ-centred
k -point mesh for GBAC–PbI 2
and 5 × 5 × 5 Γ-centred
k -point mesh for α-FAPbI 3
were used. The convergence criteria of the energy difference was set to 1.0 × 10 −5  eV. Note that the formation energy ( \(\Delta E_{{{{\mathrm{\delta }}}} \text{-} {{{\mathrm{FAPbI}}}}_3}\) ) was calculated using the equation
\({{\Delta }}E_{{{{\mathrm{\delta }}}} \text{-} {{{\mathrm{FAPbI}}}}_3} = 2E_{{{{\mathrm{\delta }}}} \text{-} {{{\mathrm{FAPbI}}}}_3} - 2E_{{{{\mathrm{PbI}}}}_2} - 4E_{{{{\mathrm{FAI}}}}}\)
for PbI 2  + FAI→δ-FAPbI 3 , where
\(E_{{{{\mathrm{\delta }}}} \text{-} {{{\mathrm{FAPbI}}}}_3}\)
is the energy of δ-FAPbI 3 ,
\(E_{{{{\mathrm{PbI}}}}_2}\)
is the energy of PbI 2
calculated from bulk PbI 2
and
E FAI
is the energy calculated from gas-phase FAI. The formation energy of bulk GBAC–PbI 2
was calculated by the equation
\({{\Delta }}E_{{{{\mathrm{GBAC}}}} - {{{\mathrm{PbI}}}}_2} = E_{{{{\mathrm{GBAC}}}} - {{{\mathrm{PbI}}}}_2} - 2E_{{{{\mathrm{PbI}}}}_2} - 4E_{{{{\mathrm{GBAC}}}}}\)
for PbI 2  + GBAC→GBAC–PbI 2 , where
E GBAC
is the energy calculated from gas-phase GBAC. The formation energy of intermediate-phase GBAC–PbI 2 –DMF was calculated with the equation
\({{\Delta }}E_{{{{\mathrm{GBAC}}}} - {{{\mathrm{PbI}}}}_2 - {{{\mathrm{DMF}}}}} = E_{{{{\mathrm{GBAC}}}} - {{{\mathrm{PbI}}}}_2 - {{{\mathrm{DMF}}}}} - 2E_{{{{\mathrm{PbI}}}}_2} - 4E_{{{{\mathrm{GBAC}}}}} - 8E_{{{{\mathrm{DMF}}}}}\)
for PbI 2  + GBAC + DMF→GBAC–PbI 2 –DMF, where
E DMF
is the energy of the DMF molecules. For slab calculations, the Brillouin zone was sampled with a 2 × 2 × 1 Γ-centred
k -point mesh, and a vacuum of at least 30 Å was used to avoid the interaction of neighbouring interfaces along the
z
direction. The electrostatic potentials ( φ ) of the interacting pairs were calculated using the Gaussian 09 package at the B3LYP/def2TZVP level with DFT-D3. The maximum
φ
( φ max ) and minimum
φ
( φ min ) values of the interacting pairs were obtained with the help of Multiwfn code 47 . The structure models were drawn with the VESTA software 48 . Some data processing was done by VASPKIT 49 . Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the

Devices for energy harvesting Solar cells
Abstract Organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites have shown photovoltaic performances above 20% in a range of solar cell architectures while offering simple and low-cost processability. Despite the multiple ionic compositions that have been reported so far, the presence of organic constituents is an essential element in all of the high-efficiency formulations, with the methylammonium and formamidinium cations being the sole efficient options available to date. In this study, we demonstrate improved material stability after the incorporation of a large organic cation, guanidinium, into the MAPbI 3
crystal structure, which delivers average power conversion efficiencies over 19%, and stabilized performance for 1,000 h under continuous light illumination, a fundamental step within the perovskite field.

Main Hybrid perovskites have recently emerged as outstanding materials for efficient and low-cost solar technology. Unique properties, including high absorption coefficient 1 , large charge-carrier diffusion length 2 , small exciton binding energy 3
and low trap density 4 , pushed their performances to a record efficiency beyond 22% 5 . The most common perovskite arranges into APbX 3 , (A  =  CH 3 NH 3
+
(methylammonium, MA) or CH 3 (NH 2 ) 2
+
(formamidinium, FA); X  =  Cl − , Br − or I − ), which crystallizes in a three-dimensional (3D) network 3 . Among different candidates, mixed ionic compositions of MA and FA cations 6
and Br − /I −
halides have recently led to superior performance, with efficiencies close to 21% for (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15
(ref.
7 ). Nevertheless, these improvements in the efficiency of perovskite materials come with stability concerns, due to decomposition to the initial precursors 8 , and intrinsic halide segregation 9 , 10
with ambiguous long-term consequences. To overcome the stability issue, a few strategies have been proposed 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , including the exploration of alternative cations. Recent reports have shown promising results with the introduction of Cs +
and Rb +
mixtures into the hybrid (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15
structure, leading to a complex triple 15
and quadruple 16
composition with efficiency over 20%. Nevertheless, organic alternatives with a proper ionic radius ( R ), such as hydrazinium [H 3 N–NH 2 ] +
or azetidinium [(CH 2 ) 3 NH 2 ] +
(ref.
17 ), that can fit into the inorganic Pb–I framework while maintaining an adequate Goldschmidt tolerance factor ( \(t=\left({R}_{{\rm{A}}}+{R}_{{\rm{I}}}\right)/\sqrt{2}\left({R}_{{\rm{Pb}}}+{R}_{{\rm{I}}}\right)\)
to ensure a cubic structure ( t  = 0.8–1) 17 , 18
are not available. On the other hand, obtaining good perovskite films with alternative cations has been experimentally challenging, and no results comparable to the state-of-the-art perovskites have been reported so far. Here we introduce a perovskite based on the organic cation guanidinium (CH 6 N 3
+ , Gua) as a more stable and efficient alternative to the state-of-the-art MAPbI 3 . Gua features an ionic radius of ~278 pm (ref.
17 ), slightly above the upper limit of the tolerance factor ( t
~1.03), forming low-dimensional perovskites (LDPs) when mixed with PbI 2
(refs
19 , 20 ). In this work, we demonstrate that when combined with methylammonium in a mixed MA 1– x
Gua
x

composition (0 <  x  < 0.25) the Gua cation inserts in the crystal unit, forming a 3D perovskite with enhanced thermal and environmental stability. Our results widen the exploration of cations with a radius beyond the tolerance limit, while preserving a 3D structure and high photovoltaic performance. With this approach, solar cells display an average photoconversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.2 ± 0.4% at enhanced stability. Structural characterization of MA 1– x

crystal structure, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of the thin films were performed (see Methods for details). Figure  1a
shows the diffractograms of the perovskite films containing MA/Gua mixtures, where 0 <  x

Gua
represents the Gua molar ratio), compared with MAPbI 3 . The incorporation of Gua cations yields a gradual decrease of the reflection peak intensity, but retaining the MAPbI 3
tetragonal phase even for
x
Gua  = 0.25. Larger Gua percentages significantly decrease the diffraction signal, while the appearance of new diffraction peaks at 8.54° and 11.31° indicates the formation of a 1D GuaPbI 3
phase, as previously reported 21 . Interestingly, a closer inspection of the reflection peaks reveals a notable shift to lower angles, as shown in the zoom of Fig.  1b
corresponding to the (110) and (220) lattice planes. On increasing the Gua content, a gradual shift of the peaks occurs, as reported for the FAPbI 3

value remains constant for all percentages, 12.625 Å, while
a
gradually changes from 8.838 Å to 8.902 Å, remaining invariable for Gua contents larger than 25% (Fig.  1c ). Thus, a distortion of the crystal prevalently affecting the
a
and
b
lattice parameters takes place for
x
Gua  < 0.25. Due to the mismatch in size with respect to the MA cation, the incorporation of Gua entails local distortions in the crystal, which manifest as a broadening of the peaks. The crystal strains in the structure are evaluated using the Williamson–Hall method (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). The results demonstrate an increased number of micro-strains and distortions of the MAPbI 3
lattice at larger percentages of Gua, supporting its inclusion in the crystal. However, further increments do not incorporate into the crystalline network and lead to a phase-separated 1D GuaPbI 3 , as suggested by the XRD. It is worth noting that these results are in contradiction to those of previous reports, where Gua has been proposed as a passivating agent that does not incorporate into the perovskite structure due to its larger size 24 . Nevertheless, significant variations in the preparation method could account for the different crystallization dynamics. Here, we incorporate Gua within the precursor solution, ensuring the desired stoichiometry during crystallization. Fig. 1: XRD and XPS characterization of Gua-based perovskites.

The relative composition and chemical environment of the constituents in the perovskite materials have been analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Measurements performed for the pure MA and Gua phases and four representative mixtures ( x
Gua  = 12.5%, 25% 30% and 50%) reveal the formation of Pb–I bonds and a relative Pb/I ratio of ~3.0, consistent with the theoretical stoichiometry present in the 3D MA 1– x

and 1D GuaPbI 3
structures (Supplementary Fig.  2a ). In addition, the photoemission spectra of the N 1 s
region reveals the two peaks attributed to the NH 3
+
group in MA (402.3 eV) and the NH 2
+
group in Gua (400.3 eV), which changes gradually in intensity on increasing the Gua content (Fig.  1d ). The initial experimental MA/Gua ratio is preserved within the final structure, as presented in Fig.  1e
(corroborated by NMR measurements, Supplementary Fig.  2b,c ), which is particularly valuable in the determination of the crystalline structure. To analyse the role of Gua in the crystalline material and examine the stability of the MA 1– x
Gua
x
PbI 3
structures, density functional theory with generalized gradient approximation (DFT–GGA) calculations using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange correlation functional were conducted. An estimation of the formation enthalpies at zero temperature, Δ H
f , for the pure MA and Gua phases, as well as for that containing
x
Gua  = 0.25 was performed (Supplementary Note  1 ). A remarkable difference for the three perovskite structures was found, with a clear tendency when increasing the Gua content: Δ H
f(MA_pure)  = −0.149 eV  ≫  Δ H
f(MA0.75_Gua0.25)  = −1.484 eV > Δ H
f(Gua_pure)
=  −2.045 eV. Compared with the pure MAPbI 3
phase, which exhibits a value close to zero, consistent with previous reports 25 , 26 , 1D GuaPbI 3
points to enhanced stability, as expected for LDP 27 . However, a striking result appears for the mixed Ma 0.75 Gua 0.25 PbI 3
perovskite, which also exhibits a highly negative formation enthalpy, close to that of the 1D GuaPbI 3 , while maintaining its 3D structure. Note that such a behaviour has important implications for the performance of the solar cell, as the substitution of Gua for ¼ of MA in the MAPbI 3
structure results in a significant increase of the system stability. Besides, a phase separation of the MA 0.75 Gua 0.25 PbI 3
into the pure MA and Gua systems was found to be thermodynamically less favoured (Δ H
f  =
−0.622 eV), and it is foreseen that it does not occur at a lower percentage of Gua. Only at additions higher than 25%, both Ma 0.75 Gua 0.25 PbI 3
and GuaPbI 3
crystalline phases appear, given the impossibility of the 3D octahedral [PbI 6 ] network to accommodate additional Gua cations. Figure  1f
shows the optimized unit cell for Ma 0.75 Gua 0.25 PbI 3 , where the main H–I interactions with the Gua cation can be identified. Note that the formation of hydrogen bonds plays a key role in the structural stabilization. Compared with the 1–2 H bonds per MA molecule 28 , the introduction of Gua increases the number of interactions to six H bonds while reducing the H–I distance, which seems to be the ultimate cause for the superior Ma 0.75 Gua 0.25 PbI 3
stability. Importantly, our results suggest that the crystal distortions produced by the larger cation could be compensated at the expense of the neighbouring cavities where the small MA cation localizes, preserving its 3D structure. Optical and electronic properties The effect of the lattice expansion on the optoelectronic properties was also analysed by DFT–GGA calculations. The electronic band structures and density of states for MAPbI 3
and two representative mixtures (12.5% and 25% of Gua content) show no appreciable difference, with I 5 p
states mainly contributing to the top valence band and Pb 6 p
states dominating the lowest conduction band (Supplementary Fig.  3 ). Nevertheless, there is a small but gradual increase in the bandgap energy with the insertion of Gua, showing values equal to 1.77 eV, 1.79 eV and 1.82 eV for MAPbI 3 , 12.5% and 25% of Gua, respectively. The direct character of the MAPbI 3
bandgap is also conserved in the two mixtures, with the minimum bandgap occurring at the Γ symmetry point. Moreover, the three samples display a similar dispersion of the valence and conduction bands, which ensures low carrier effective masses. Consequently, the incorporation of Gua preserves the optical properties of the material. Figure  2a

Gua
<  0.2, except a tiny but continuous shift in the absorption band edge, as illustrated in the inset of Fig.  2a . Yet,
x
Gua
>  0.2 produces an appreciable lowering of the absorption capacity along with a blueshift of the band edge (~ 0.02 eV), indicative of a widening of the bandgap. This can be related to the different organic–inorganic interactions mediated by the new hydrogen bonds, which lead to local distortions at the Gua neighbouring positions, and expand the crystal unit. Results for higher Gua percentages are also reported in Supplementary Fig.  4a . A sharp band edge at ~500 nm, with a remarkable excitonic peak at 390 nm appears for pure 1D GuaPbI 3
(ref.
21 ). This is also detected for
x
Gua
>  0.5, which, together with the absorption band edge of Ma 0.75 Gua 0.25 PbI 3
at ~775 nm, confirms the preservation of both individual phases. Accordingly, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra shown in Fig.  2b
(Supplementary Fig.  4b–d ) manifest a gradual shift towards higher energy for samples with
x
Gua
<  0.2 (see inset to Fig.  2b ), which becomes more apparent for
x
Gua
=  0.25, and is preserved for larger Gua amounts, consistent with the results observed in Fig.  2a . These findings provide compelling evidence that the substitution of Gua for MA efficiently stabilizes a 3D perovskite phase while retaining extended and efficient absorption similar to MAPbI 3 .

In addition, the electronic structure was also investigated by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). The results reveal a slight gradual shift of the valence band onset (by 0.04–0.09 eV) towards the Fermi level from MAPbI 3
to MA 1– x
Gua
x
PbI 3
samples containing up to 25% Gua, while retaining the main valence band features of MAPbI 3 , as depicted in Fig.  2c . Concomitantly, the ionization energy becomes slightly reduced (by up to 0.14 eV). However, larger amounts of Gua ( > 25%) result in a shift of the valence band onset away from the Fermi level. A solid change in the valence band features, increasingly resembling those corresponding to pure GuaPbI 3
(binding energy region between 5.5 eV and 8.7 eV), suggests the coexistence of GuaPbI 3
at the surface above 25% Gua content, which is corroborated also by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; as discussed below). As GuaPbI 3
contains an increased number of Pb 0 -related surface states, which tend to pin the Fermi level close to the conduction band minimum 29
(Supplementary Fig.  2a ), the wider gap of GuaPbI 3
as compared with MAPbI 3
results in the shift of the valence band onset towards higher binding energy for

(0 <  x  < 0.25) into solar cells sandwiched in between the mesoporous (mp)-TiO 2 , used as the electron-transporting material, and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis( N , N ′-di- p -methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), as the hole-transporting material (Fig.  3a
and Supplementary Fig.  5 ). The average photovoltaic parameters obtained from the cells are shown in Fig.  3b
and listed in Table  1 , which also includes the champion cells obtained for each condition (see also Supplementary Table  1 ). The short-circuit current density ( \({J}_{{\rm{sc}}}\) ) hardly changes for Gua fractions up to 20%, but gradually lowers for increased Gua contents, with 14% of Gua outstanding among the others. This behaviour can be related to the decreased absorption detected for
x
Gua
>  0.2, as supported by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra shown in Fig.  3c
(photographs of the as-prepared MA 1– x
Gua

solar cells are provided in Supplementary Fig.  6 ). In addition, the average open-circuit voltage ( \({V}_{{\rm{oc}}}\) ) increases progressively with the Gua incorporation, from 1.04 ± 0.02 V for
x  = 0 to 1.085 ± 0.02 V for
x  = 0.25 (see Table  1 ), as expected from the optical bandgap observations. Notably, the fill factor (FF) remains almost unaltered, with high average values over 0.75 (and maxima close to 0.80). As a result, the PCE of the prepared cells increases from 17 ± 1% for MAPbI 3
to 19.2 ± 0.4% for the Gua/MA mixed system containing 14% Gua, with a champion cell efficiency of 20.15%. Moreover, even for perovskites containing 25% Gua, the photovoltaic performance remains similar to that of the MAPbI 3 , with an average PCE of 17.1 ± 0.8% and a record efficiency of 18.30% (Supplementary Fig.  7 ). The current density versus voltage ( \(J-V\) ) curve and EQE obtained for the champion device are presented in Fig.  4a,b , respectively. The EQE demonstrates high photon-to-current conversion over 80% throughout the entire ultraviolet–visible spectrum, leading to an integrated current density of 22.09 mA cm −2 .
J–V
hysteresis measurements are reported in Supplementary Fig.  8 . We also analysed the charge dynamics by electro-chemical impedance spectroscopy (Supplementary Figs.  9
and
10 ), which suggest an increased recombination resistance and longer electron lifetime with Gua incorporation, possibly related to a more efficient charge extraction and better crystal formation. Fig. 3: Device architecture and photovoltaic performance.

Device stability and phase segregation analysis The device stability has been tested under AM1.5 G Sun illumination at maximum power point (MPP) tracking, for more than 1,000 hours, at 60 °C and under an Ar atmosphere. The results (Fig.  4d ) reveal an enhanced stability for higher Gua contents, providing evidence of the beneficial effect on the material stability, as predicted by the simulations. Despite the initial decrease, recently associated with the inter-penetration of spiro-OMeTAD and gold electrode 30 , a gradual stabilization and recuperation of the performance is observed, which is reproducible (Supplementary Fig.  11a ) and clearly correlated with the Gua content. Alternatively, we have performed an initial light stress test at 85 °C using polytriarylamine polymer, a more stable hole-transporting material, under 300 h of illumination, which further confirms the enhanced stability compared with MAPbI 3 , for the mixed MA/Gua perovskite (Supplementary Fig.  11b ). To gain insight into the phase stability and micro-structure of the mixed MA/Gua system, we analysed the film morphology and phase segregation using SEM and combined micro-Raman and micro-photoluminescence (micro-PL) spectroscopy. Figure  5a–d
shows the SEM images obtained for four representative compositions, including the pure MAPbI 3
and GuaPbI 3
phases, as well as samples containing Gua below and above 25%, at which the phase segregation may occur. As presented in the figure, the MAPbI 3
film has a grainy-like morphology with large crystal domains of around 1 µm diameter (see orange line). On the contrary, GuaPbI 3
presents an elongated rod-like morphology with crystals of several micrometres in length, typical for the 1D aggregation. Notably, samples containing
x
Gua
<  0.25 do not show any similar phase, resembling the MAPbI 3
but with a considerably increased size of the crystal domains, as emphasized by the orange line in the picture. A relation between the amount of Gua and the size of the crystal domains is also observed for all samples, in which the domains remain like islands of several micrometres within the capping layer (Supplementary Figs.  12
and
13 ). The 1D-like morphology is detected only for samples containing higher amounts of Gua ( > 25%), as also appreciated in Fig.  5 , at which phase segregation occurs. Fig. 5: Morphology and phase segregation analysis.

These results are confirmed by the micro-Raman and micro-PL analysis (Fig.  5e,f ). Averaged over a diffraction-limited spot size of 300 nm, this technique can provide further information about local heterogeneities within the film 31 . The emission of four different samples was investigated, with a particular focus on the distribution of the PL peak position. The latter is intimately linked to the material bandgap, which changes with composition 9
and/or local disorder 32
over microscopic areas of the samples. Fig.  5e
shows the map of the PL peak position over 6 × 6 µm 2
regions. In the wavelength emission range between 710 nm and 780 nm, no appreciable change in the PL peak is observed for
x
Gua
<  0.25, remaining around 770 nm, as for the pure MAPbI 3
(Supplementary Fig.  14 ). On the contrary, the addition of 75% Gua leads to the appearance of a contrasted PL map with regions extending up to a few micrometres, with a remarkable PL shift down to 710 nm. This behaviour indicates a phase segregation in the material, resulting in a distribution of different bandgaps across the film. On the same areas, micro-Raman spectra were recorded (Fig.  5f ). For Gua contents up to 25%, the Raman spectra closely resemble that for the pure MAPbI 3 . Characteristic broad peaks in the region below 200 cm −1
are observed related to the Pb–I stretching and bending modes 33 , 34 , along with a broad feature around 250 cm −1
related to the vibrations of the organic cation. Remarkably, as recently observed with FA incorporation to the MAPbI 3 , a gradual shift of the peak to lower wavenumber appears, suggesting a shrinking of the mode due to the incorporation of the distinct Gua cation in the unit cell. For Gua content above 25%, we could identify a position-dependent signal that changes in line with the PL variation. Some regions show a similar spectrum as for the lower Gua content, while on the regions presenting the ‘rod-like’ morphology, a redistribution of the relative peak intensity happens with a dominant peak at 120 cm −1
and an additional peak at 135 cm −1 , both with a reduced broadening of the signal. This peak shift is usually attributed to isolated Pb–I planes, similarly to the case of PbI 2
intercalated with large organic molecules 35 , which suggest the formation of a LDP as for the pure GuaPbI 3
arranging into the 1D phase. As corroborated in the figure, GuaPbI 3
shows apparent peaks at 120 cm −1
and 135 cm −1
as previously asserted for the 75 % sample. These results further confirm the phase homogeneity of the mixed MA 1– x
Gua
x
PbI 3
for Gua < 25%, which, on the contrary, reveals a severe phase segregation into a 3D/1D mixture for larger Gua amounts, while retaining the individual features of the single constituents. No visible degradation signs are observed during the PL measurements, as shown in Supplementary Fig.  14b . Conclusions We present a perovskite composition based on a combination of Gua/MA cations that exhibits superior photovoltaic performance and material stability compared with MAPbI 3.
We demonstrate that the incorporation of large Gua cations unexpectedly forms a highly stable 3D crystalline structure, plausibly mediated by the increased number of H bonds within the inorganic framework. The prepared MA 1– x

perovskite preserved the good optoelectronic properties associated with the organic lead halide materials, leading to a high PCE surpassing 20% for a Gua content of 14%. Our results emphasize the versatility of organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites, and invite further exploration of organic cations including those that are beyond the limit of the tolerance factor. Methods Solar cell fabrication Perovskite solar cells were fabricated on F-doped SnO 2
(NSG10) substrates previously cleaned by a sequential sonication treatment in a 2% Hellmanex solution, acetone and isopropanol, followed by ultraviolet–ozone treatment for 15 min. A compact blocking layer of TiO 2
(bl-TiO 2 , 30 nm in thickness) was then deposited onto the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate by spray pyrolysis, using a titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution in ethanol (60% v/v), and then sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. A 200-nm-thick layer of mesoporous TiO 2
(mp-TiO 2 , 30 NR-D titania paste from Dyesol) was prepared by spin-coating a diluted TiO 2
dispersion in ethanol, ratio 1:8 by weight, at 2,000 r.p.m. for 15 s followed by a sintering step at 500 °C for 30 min. Afterwards, the substrates were lithium-treated by spin-coating 40 μl of tris (bis (trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (Li-TFS) (14.67 mg ml –1
in acetonitrile) onto the mesoporous layer, followed by a sintering step at 500 °C for 30 min. Stoichiometric precursor solutions were prepared by mixing MAI, GuaI (Dyesol) and PbI 2
(TCI) in
N , N ′-dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) with MAI/GuaI gradually changing from 1:0 to 0:1, while keeping the PbI 2
molarity equal to 1.25. The perovskite layers were then fabricated by using a two-step spin-coating process reported previously 36
(first step 1,000 r.p.m. for 10 s; second step 4,000 r.p.m for 30 s), and 15 s before the end of the programme, 100 µl of chlorobenzene was poured onto the films, and then the substrates were annealed at 100 °C for 45 min. After this time, spiro-OMeTAD was spin-coated at 4,000 r.p.m., for 30 s from a chlorobenzene solution (28.9 mg in 400 μl, 60 mmol) containing Li-TFSI (7.0 μl from a 520 mg ml –1
stock solution in acetonitrile), TBP (11.5 μl) and Co(II)TFSI (10 mol%, 8.8 μl from a 40 mg ml –1
stock solution) as dopants. Finally, a 70 nm gold electrode was evaporated. Thin-film characterization The XRD patterns of the prepared films were measured using a D8 Advance diffractometer from Bruker (Bragg–Brentano geometry, with an X-ray tube Cu Kα,
λ  = 1.5406 Å). The absorption spectra were registered with an ultraviolet–visible–infrared spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Instrument). Photoluminescence (PL) steady-state measurements were recorded with a spectrophotometer (Gilden Photonics). The micro-PL and micro-Raman measurements were performed on a Renishaw InVia Raman microscope with an L100× objective (spot size of about 300 nm). The PL map was recorded using 0.0005% laser intensity (corresponding to 100 µJ cm –2 ), using a 532 nm green laser diode. The spectra were registered in the 710–820 nm region. Raman spectra were obtained using the same excitation monitoring the 50–250 cm −1
range, particularly sensitive to the Pb–I modes. The final data were averaged over 50 accumulations to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio. To prevent sample degradation or thermal effects, the laser power intensity was kept below (excitation density of around 3 mW cm –2
(0.005%)) and the light exposure time per measurement was 0.1 s. Photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were performed in an ultrahigh-vacuum system (base pressure of 2 × 10 −10
mbar) using a He-discharge ultraviolet source (Omicron) with an excitation energy of 21.2 eV for UPS and an Al Kα X-ray source (excitation energy: 1486.6 eV) for XPS. The photoelectron spectra were recorded using a Phoibos 100 (Specs) hemispherical energy analyser at a pass energy of 5 eV for the valence band and a pass energy of 20 eV for the core levels. For workfunction determination, the secondary-electron cutoff was recorded by applying a −10 V sample bias to clear the analyser workfunction. The reported valence band spectra were background subtracted. The binding energies for all of the photoemission spectra are referenced to the Fermi level. For a comparison of the XPS core-level spectra, the binding energy values were all adjusted to the C 1 s
carbon at lower binding energy that was here referenced to 285 eV. A mixed Gaussian/Lorentzian peak shape and a Shirley-type background were employed for XPS peak fitting with the XPS Peak 4.1 software. NMR measurements were performed for samples containing up to 30% Gua. Mixed MA 1– x

perovskite films were prepared on conductive FTO substrates in the same conditions as for the photovoltaic devices. Once the perovskite layers were crystallized, the solid films were re-dissolved in deuterated DMSO (DMSO-d6) and directly analysed in liquid-state
1 H-NMR 800 MHz instruments equipped with a 5 mm triple-channel
1 H/ 13 C/ 15 N cryoprobe and a AVII console. The method used was a single pulse with 16 scans, a delay of 5 s and a pulse length of 7.8 µs. Device characterization The photovoltaic device performance was analysed using a VeraSol LED solar simulator (Newport) producing 1 Sun AM 1.5 (1,000 W m –2 ) sunlight. Current–voltage curves were measured in air with a potentiostat (Keithley 2604). The light intensity was calibrated with a NREL-certified KG5-filtered Si reference diode. The solar cells were masked with a metal aperture of 0.16 cm 2
to define the active area. The cells were measured in air, at room temperature and without encapsulation, at a constant rate 10 mV s −1
for both forward and reverse bias. No special pre-conditioning protocol was used apart from 5 s of stabilization time before the measurement. No anti-reflective coating was used during the measurement. The stability test was performed in a sealed cell holder flushed with a flow of argon (30 ml min –1 ) and
I–V
curves were characterized by an electronic system using a 22-bit delta–sigma analog-to-digital converter, performed every 2 h. For
I–V
curve measurement, a scan rate of 25 mV s –1
with a step of 5 mV was used, maintaining the temperature of the cells at around 60 °C. Cells were maintained at the maximum power point using a MPP tracking algorithm under 100 mW cm –2 . A reference Si photodiode was placed in the holder to verify the stability of the light. EQE was measured with the IQE200B (Oriel) without bias light.

x
PbI 3 , where
x  = 0, 0.25 and 1, only the organic material position was optimized, restricting the Pb and I position to those obtained from the diffractogram. We proceed in this way because the MA geometric arrangement is not known in detail from the information obtained from the diffractograms 42 , 43 . Periodic DFT–GGA calculations using the PBE exchange correlation functional were performed 44 . Electron–ion interactions were described by ultrasoft pseudopotentials. In the case of the Pb atom, we used a scalar relativistic pseudopotential. A 4 × 4 × 4 Monkhorst—Pack grid was chosen for sampling the Brillouin zone 45 . Given that these compounds are essentially ionic in nature, electrostatic interactions well described by DFT–GGA are expected to represent the main contribution in the interaction. This is indirectly confirmed by the usually good agreement between experimental and calculated structural parameters for this type of material 46 .

Abstract Magnetic small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) is a powerful technique for investigating magnetic nanoparticle assemblies in nonmagnetic matrices. For such microstructures, the standard theory of magnetic SANS assumes uniformly magnetized nanoparticles (macrospin model). However, there exist many experimental and theoretical studies which suggest that this assumption is violated: deviations from ellipsoidal particle shape, crystalline defects, or the interplay between various magnetic interactions (exchange, magnetic anisotropy, magnetostatics, external field) may lead to nonuniform spin structures. Therefore, a theoretical framework of magnetic SANS of nanoparticles needs to be developed. Here, we report numerical micromagnetic simulations of the static spin structure and related unpolarized magnetic SANS of a single cobalt nanorod. While in the saturated state the magnetic SANS cross section is (as expected) determined by the particle form factor, significant deviations appear for nonsaturated states; specifically, at remanence, domain-wall and vortex states emerge which result in a magnetic SANS signal that is composed of all three magnetization Fourier components, giving rise to a complex angular anisotropy on a two-dimensional detector. The strength of the micromagnetic simulation methodology is the possibility to decompose the cross section into the individual Fourier components, which allows one to draw important conclusions regarding the fundamentals of magnetic SANS.

Introduction Magnetic nanoparticles are the building blocks of the future magnetism-based technological applications 1 , 2 . At the nanoscale, complex spin structures such as vortices or skyrmions may appear 3 , which originate from the competition between various magnetic interactions and/or from geometrical constraints 4 . In order to image such spin structures, it is important to have observational techniques at hand which allow one to see the magnetization distribution on the nanometer length scale. Recent examples include spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy 3 , which has been employed to observe and manipulate skyrmions in ultra-thin films 5 , 6 , 7 , or electron holography, which has been used to investigate the temperature and magnetic-field dependence of the magnetic moments of individual skyrmions 8 , or to show that the structure of a vortex state can be adjusted by varying the aspect ratio of single-crystal hcp Co nanowires 9 . Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) has also been recognized as a powerful technique for studying nanostructured magnetic materials; for instance, SANS is crucial for studying the skyrmion lattice in MnSi 10 , 11 , ferromagnetic nanorod and nanowire arrays 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , magnetic nanoparticles 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , bulk magnets including magnetic steels 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , or the magnetic microstructure of nanocrystalline Nd-Fe-B magnets 27 , 28 , 29 . Indeed, due to the magnetic sensitivity and the high transparency of neutrons to matter, SANS provides nanometer-scale (~1–100 nm) information from within the bulk of a sample; these properties render SANS complementary to other observational experimental techniques which probe the local surface rather than the bulk structure. Whilst for bulk ferromagnets the theory of magnetic SANS has recently been developed 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , for isolated magnetic nanoparticles in a nonmagnetic matrix the theoretical description of magnetic SANS is still in its infancy; in particular, when microstructural-defect or particle-shape-induced spin misalignment is present. In fact, the magnetic SANS theory of nanoparticles remains an open problem that needs to be resolved for an accurate analysis of experimental data. So far, magnetic SANS data are mostly analyzed by expressing the magnetic SANS cross section
\(d{{\rm{\Sigma }}}_{M}/d{\rm{\Omega }}\)
at momentum-transfer or scattering vector
q
in terms of noninterfering single-particle form factors 19 , 36 , 37 , $$\frac{d{{\rm{\Sigma }}}_{M}}{d{\rm{\Omega }}}({\bf{q}})=n{({\rm{\Delta }}{\rho }_{{\rm{mag}}})}^{2}{V}_{p}^{2}\,|F({\bf{q}}{)|}^{2}{\sin }^{{\rm{2}}}\alpha ,$$

is the particle volume,
F ( q ) its form factor, and the
\({\sin }^{2}\alpha \)
factor is due to the dipolar nature of the neutron-magnetic interaction. For a single-domain particle,

For many problems the macrospin model that is embodied in equation ( 1 ) is oversimplified, since it assumes homogeneous (or stepwise homogeneous) magnetization and, thus, ignores the complex spin structures that may appear at the nanoscale. As mentioned above, intraparticle spin disorder is due to the interplay between different magnetic interactions such as surface anisotropy and dipolar interaction, or to the presence of crystal defects. Therefore, SANS approaches based on the “standard model” [equation ( 1 )] might be erroneous when the spatial dependence of the
magnitude and direction
of the magnetization
M ( r ) is not taken into account 31 . Günther
et al . 16
have suggested the presence of significant intraparticle spin disorder when analyzing SANS experiments on a Co nanorod array: the strong field dependence of
\(d{\rm{\Sigma }}/d{\rm{\Omega }}\)
that these authors have observed could not be explained by the standard expression for
\(d{\rm{\Sigma }}/d{\rm{\Omega }}\) . Likewise, the polarized SANS experiments on ferromagnetic nanowires by Napolskii
et al . 14
and by Maurer
et al . 17
indicate that the nanowires’ stray fields have to be taken into account in the magnetic form-factor derivation. Micromagnetic computer simulations are ideally suited to tackle the above described problem, since one can include in a straightforward manner all the relevant inter- and intraparticle magnetic interactions (dipolar and Zeeman interactions, magnetic anisotropy, exchange), which in turn allows one to compute the magnetic SANS cross section for an inhomogeneously magnetized nanoparticle. Note that analytical micromagnetic calculations of the magnetic SANS cross section of nanoparticles are extremely difficult due to the nonlinear character of the underlying differential equations; a first attempt into this direction has been carried out by Metlov and Michels 34 , who computed the magnetic scattering related to vortices in thin submicron-sized soft ferromagnetic cylinders. Important aspects of computational micromagnetism are that (i) the parameter space can be relatively quickly scanned and that (ii) this methodology permits the investigation of the impact of the different interactions on magnetic SANS simply by switching on and off these interactions in simulations; such a procedure may then provide fundamental information on magnetic SANS. Up to now, however, this approach has only been used for studying bulk ferromagnets 39 , 40 , 41 , 42 , where not only the relevant magnetic interactions may strongly differ from those in nanoparticles, but where all phases (and not only the nanoparticle phase) comprising the material are ferromagnetic. Needless to say that for nanoparticles the particle shape also plays an important role for the spin configuration. In this paper we employ micromagnetic computer simulations in order to investigate the magnetic SANS cross section of an isolated Co nanorod for different nanorod diameters. The choice of this particular system is motivated by the great interest from both the fundamental and technological point of view. Indeed, the structural and magnetic properties of elongated magnetic nanoobjects in the form of nanorods (or nanowires) have emerged as some of the most promising materials for functionalized magnetic nanostructures, with relevant interest in biomedicine 43 , permanent magnets 44 , and information technologies 4 , 45 . Cobalt nanowires may be suitable candidates for dense three-dimensional arrays of magnetic vortex-based media 9 , 46
and for the integration in nanooscillators based on arrays of magnetostatically coupled Co/Au segmented nanopillars; 47
in particular, synthesis improvements based on self-organization principles have made it possible to produce monocrystalline Co nanorods with controlled easy-axis orientations, which are frequently found to be almost perpendicular to the nanorod direction 46 , 48 . Depending on the orientation of the
c -axis, the magnetization distribution at remanence can be tuned to be parallel to the nanowire axis, or to form a vortex structure when it is perpendicular. The paper is organized as follows: we begin the discussion with the saturated SANS cross sections, where the problem is a purely geometrical one. We then continue to discuss the magnetization distributions and the ensuing magnetic SANS in the remanent state as a function of the diameter-to-length ratio; here, strongly inhomogeneous magnetization structures determine the SANS cross sections of the nanorod. The decomposition of
\(d{{\rm{\Sigma }}}_{M}/d{\rm{\Omega }}\)
into the individual magnetization Fourier components in conjunction with computed hysteresis loops provides useful insights into the role of spin-misalignment scattering. The magnetic SANS cross sections for the two most often employed scattering geometries as well as information about the micromagnetic simulations can be found in the Methods section. We also refer the reader to the Supplemental Material, which contains many additional data. Results and Discussion In Fig.  2(a)-(c)
we display the computed magnetic SANS cross section of a magnetically saturated Co nanorod with a length of
\(L=500\,{\rm{nm}}\)
and a diameter of
\(D=60\,{\rm{nm}}\) . At saturation, the magnetization state of the nanorod is given by
\({\bf{M}}=\mathrm{(0,}\,\mathrm{0,}\,{M}_{z}={M}_{s})\) , so that both
\(d{{\rm{\Sigma }}}_{M}^{\perp }/d{\rm{\Omega }}\)
and
\(d{{\rm{\Sigma }}}_{M}^{\parallel }/d{\rm{\Omega }}\)
[equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 )] are exclusively determined by the Fourier coefficient
\({\tilde{M}}_{z}\)
of the longitudinal magnetization (see Methods section). By comparison to equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ), it is then seen that the perpendicular SANS cross section exhibits a
\({\sin }^{2}\theta \) -type angular anisotropy, i.e.,
\(d{{\rm{\Sigma }}}_{M}^{\perp }/d{\rm{\Omega }}\)
is elongated normal to
H
0 , while the SANS cross section in the parallel scattering geometry is isotropic. The azimuthally-averaged data
\([{\mathrm{(2}\pi )}^{-1}{\int }_{0}^{2\pi }\mathrm{(...)}d\theta ]\)
for the perpendicular case (and likewise for
\({{\bf{k}}}_{0}\,\parallel \,{{\bf{H}}}_{0}\) ) can be very well described by the form factor of a circular disc, $${F}^{2}(q)={(\frac{2{J}_{1}(qR)}{qR})}^{2},$$
(2)
where
\({J}_{1}(z)\)
denotes the first-order Bessel function and
R
is the nanorod’s radius [solid lines in Fig.  2(c) ]; in fact,
\(d{{\rm{\Sigma }}}_{M}^{\perp }/d{\rm{\Omega }}\)
and
\(d{{\rm{\Sigma }}}_{M}^{\parallel }/d{\rm{\Omega }}\)
are identical at saturation, except for a factor of 1/2 which comes in on azimuthally averaging equation ( 4 ). The results depicted in Fig.  2(a)–(c)
confirm the expected behavior for which analytical results exist. Figure 2 Computed magnetic SANS cross sections of a Co nanorod with a diameter of 60 nm and a length of 500 nm. ( a )–( c ) Saturated state; ( d )–( f ) remanent state

The solid lines in the azimuthally-averaged curves [( c ) and ( f )] represent the form factor of a cylinder which has its long axis oriented at an angle of 90° relative to the scattering vector [equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 )] (log-log scale); note that in equation ( 1 )

( \({{\bf{k}}}_{0}\perp {{\bf{H}}}_{0}\) ) and
\({\sin }^{2}\alpha =1\)
( \({{\bf{k}}}_{0}\,\parallel \,{{\bf{H}}}_{0}\) ) at saturation, and
\({\sin }^{2}\alpha =1\)
in the remanent state for both geometries. For clarity, only
\(d{{\rm{\Sigma }}}_{M}^{\perp }/d{\rm{\Omega }}\)
is shown in ( f ).

In the following we discuss the spin structures and related magnetic SANS cross sections in the remanent state as a function of the
D / L
ratio; the length of the nanorod is fixed at
\(L=500\,{\rm{nm}}\)
and the diameter is varied between
\(D=\mathrm{30,60}\) , and
\(90\,{\rm{nm}}\) . As is well known, for such shape-anisotropic particles, the long-range magnetodipolar interaction gives rise to magnetic shape anisotropy, which tends to align the magnetic moments along the nanorod’s long axis. On top of that, we consider an uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy axis
\({{\bf{K}}}_{u}\) , which is directed along the cylinder’s diameter (perpendicular to the long axis). As a consequence, the system behaves effectively like a biaxial magnetic material and the spin structure reflects the competition between both interactions; in particular, as
D
increases at constant
L
and at constant magnitude and direction of
\({{\bf{K}}}_{u}\) . Magnetization curves and spin structures for
\({K}_{u}=0\)
are shown in the Supplemental Material (Figs.  1
and
3 ). Figure 3 Computed hysteresis loops of Co nanowires with a length of

Figure  2(d)-(f)
depict the perpendicular and parallel
\(d{{\rm{\Sigma }}}_{M}/d{\rm{\Omega }}\)
at remanence
\(({H}_{0}=0)\) , where the rod’s long axis for both scattering geometries is parallel to the normal on the detector plane. For an inhomogeneously magnetized nanorod, the magnetization components
\({M}_{x,y,z}\)
depend explicitly on the position
\({\bf{r}}=\{x,y,z\}\)
and all three Fourier components
\({\tilde{M}}_{x,y,z}\)
contribute to
\(d{{\rm{\Sigma }}}_{M}/d{\rm{\Omega }}\) . It is seen in Fig.  2(d)-(e)
that a more complicated SANS pattern than in the saturated state results (see detailed discussion below); we also note that although both
\(d{{\rm{\Sigma }}}_{M}/d{\rm{\Omega }}\)
are nearly identical, the corresponding magnetization curves (for
H
0
perpendicular and parallel to the long axis) are quite different (compare Fig.  3(b)
in the paper with Fig.  2(b)
in the Supplemental Material). Importantly, the azimuthally-averaged data in Fig.  2(f)
cannot be described anymore by the geometrical form-factor model [equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 )], which assumes a uniform magnetization state. Away from saturation, the magnetic microstructure decomposes into several domains, which naturally have an average spatial extension that is
smaller
than the purely geometrical dimensions ( L ,  D ) of the nanorod. Therefore, the “form-factor” oscillations corresponding to these domains appear at
larger
values of the momentum transfer, as it becomes visible in Fig.  2(f) . Note that in the following we restrict our considerations to the case of
\({{\bf{k}}}_{0}\perp {{\bf{H}}}_{0}\) , which is the most often employed scattering geometry in magnetic SANS experiments. Before we discuss in more detail the magnetic scattering cross sections of the nanowire, we would like to show in Fig.  3
some results for the hysteresis curves and internal spin structures at remanence; note that the applied field in Fig.  3
is directed along the
\({{\bf{K}}}_{u}\) -axis. For
\(D=30\,{\rm{nm}}\)
and a corresponding relatively small ratio of
\(D/L=0.06\)
[Fig.  3(a) ], the spin structures are determined by the magnetic shape anisotropy (compare also Fig.  2(a)
and left part in Fig.  4
in the Supplemental Material). When
\({H}_{0}={H}_{z}\)
is reduced starting from saturation, the magnetization will rotate towards the shape-anisotropy axis. At remanence, the magnetization is then predominantly oriented along the
x -direction, with some minor spin misalignment along the
z -direction at the nanowire’s end faces, and a vanishingly small magnetization component along the
y -direction. The localized spin inhomogeneities at the end faces are related to the combined effects of the inhomogeneous dipole field of the rod, which tends to align the moments parallel to the surface of the nanorod’s ends, the exchange interaction, which tries to keep the ferromagnetic order, and the magnetocrystalline anisotropy, which prefers the magnetization along the ± z -direction. In the center part of the
\(D=30\,{\rm{nm}}\)
nanorod, the magnetic state at remanence is quite similar to the case without magnetocrystalline anisotropy (see Fig.  1(a)
and upper left part in Fig.  3
in the Supplemental Material); the main changes between the hysteresis loops with and without magnetocrystalline anisotropy are the reduction of the field that is needed to saturate the system along the
z -direction and the existence of a small coercivity. We will see below that as
D
increases (at constant
L
and
\({K}_{u}\) ), the (reduced) dipolar interaction favors more complex magnetic structures such as domain wall or vortex states, which minimize the magnetic flux through the surface of the system.

in the Supplemental Material, which depicts the corresponding results for

Based on these (real-space) observations, the corresponding (reciprocal-space) SANS cross section and the magnetization Fourier components for the
\(D=30\,{\rm{nm}}\)
nanorod (upper row in Fig.  4 ) can be understood:
\(d{{\rm{\Sigma }}}_{M}^{\perp }/d{\rm{\Omega }}\)
is dominated by the
\(|\tilde{{M}_{x}}{|}^{2}\)
Fourier component and contains a weak
\(|\tilde{{M}_{z}}{|}^{2}\)
contribution; the cross term
\(CT=-(\tilde{{M}_{y}^{\ast }}\tilde{{M}_{z}}+\tilde{{M}_{z}^{\ast }}\tilde{{M}_{y}})\)
is negligible, since
\({\tilde{M}}_{y}\)
becomes very small. We would like to emphasize that the latter combination of Fourier components takes on positive as well as negative values (compare scale). However, on multiplication with the trigonometric function
\(\sin \,\theta \,\cos \,\theta \)
in order to obtain the corresponding contribution to
\(d{{\rm{\Sigma }}}_{M}^{\perp }/d{\rm{\Omega }}\)
[compare equation ( 4 )] this term becomes positive-definite, since
\(\sin \,\theta \,\cos \,\theta \)
changes sign at the borders between quadrants on the detector (positive for
\({0}^{\circ } < \theta < {90}^{\circ }\) , negative for
\({90}^{\circ } < \theta < {180}^{\circ }\) , and so on). Figure  5
depicts the ( \(2\pi \) ) azimuthal averages of
\(d{{\rm{\Sigma }}}_{M}^{\perp }/d{\rm{\Omega }}\)
and of the individual Fourier components in the remanent state; this representation decrypts the magnetic SANS cross section and highlights the magnitudes and
q -dependencies of the different scattering contributions. The solid lines in Fig.  5
are the prediction by equation ( 1 ) using the cicular-disc form factor [equation ( 2 )] and a value of 1 for the expectation value of the
\({\sin }^{2}\alpha \)
factor, as appropriate for the zero-field spin configuration of a homogeneously magnetized nanorod particle (compare discussion related to equation ( 3 ) below). It is seen that only the
\(d{{\rm{\Sigma }}}_{M}^{\perp }/d{\rm{\Omega }}\)
of the
\(D=30\,{\rm{nm}}\)
nanorod can be well described by this function. The pronounced form-factor oscillations in
\(d{{\rm{\Sigma }}}_{M}^{\perp }/d{\rm{\Omega }}\)
are progressively washed out with increasing diameter. Asymptotically, all data sets show
\(d{{\rm{\Sigma }}}_{M}^{\perp }/d{\rm{\Omega }}\propto {q}^{-3}\) , in agreement with equation ( 2 ). It is also worth noting that the positions of the minima and maxima in
\(d{{\rm{\Sigma }}}_{M}^{\perp }/d{\rm{\Omega }}\)
and in the Fourier components contain information about the characteristic size of magnetic domain features. However, in the absence of analytical theory for the Fourier components and in view of the facts that (i) the shape of the domains is field-dependent and not spherical (no single size parameter) and (ii) there exist no sharp boundaries between domains, the detailed analysis of the field dependence of the Fourier components and their relation to the real-space magnetization distribution is beyond the scope of this paper.

As mentioned above, increasing the nanorod’s diameter results in the emergence of a variety of magnetization switching processes and complex inhomogeneous states, in agreement with results by other authors 48 , 49 , 50 , 51 ; this is in contrast to the case of vanishing magnetocrystalline anisotropy (see Figs.  1
and
3
in the Supplemental Material). While for
\(D=30\,{\rm{nm}}\)
the shape anisotropy determines the magnetic configuration at remanence [Fig.  3(a) ], changing the diameter to
\(D=60\,{\rm{nm}}\)
( \(D/L=0.12\) ) [Fig.  3(b) ] reduces the strength of the shape anisotropy and the competition with the magnetocrystalline anisotropy leads to a change in the switching mechanism from essentially coherent rotation to the nucleation and propagation of a transversal domain wall. The domain oriented along the
x -direction grows by propagating a transversal domain wall at the lateral boundaries of the cylinder [compare inset in Fig.  3(b) ]. Therefore, the remanent state is characterized by this transversal domain wall. The related SANS cross section (middle row in Fig.  4 ) can be seen as a combination of all three magnetization Fourier components; note also that the
CT
term is now increased in magnitude as compared to the
\(D=30\,{\rm{nm}}\)
case (due to an increased
\({\tilde{M}}_{y}\)
contribution). Notably, the circular symmetry of the magnetic SANS cross section observed at remanence for the smallest diameter has now turned into a (slightly) vertically elongated pattern due to the existence of magnetization components perpendicular to the rod’s axis, which directly result from the tranversal domain-wall configuration. Finally, when the diameter is increased to
\(D=90\,{\rm{nm}}\)
corresponding to an aspect ratio of
\(D/L=0.18\)
[Fig.  3(c) ], there is again a change in the mechanism from the nucleation and propagation of transversal domain-wall-like structures to vortex-like configurations. Indeed, the spin texture which stabilizes the system at remanence is a combination of different vortices (in those structures the magnetization is confined in the
x - z -plane) with their cores aligned parallel and antiparallel to the
y -direction, in other words, the vortex cores are oriented perpendicular to the plane that is spanned by the uniaxial and shape-anisotropy axes. As an example, Fig.  6
shows the spin distribution of the
\(D=90\,{\rm{nm}}\)
nanorod. Consequently, the
\(|{\tilde{M}}_{y}{|}^{2}\)
Fourier component is small in magnitude and the SANS cross section (lower row in Fig.  4 ) is dominated by
\(|{\tilde{M}}_{x}{|}^{2}\)
and
\(|{\tilde{M}}_{z}{|}^{2}\) , resulting in a distorted pattern with a slight elongation along the field direction. By comparison of the magnetization Fourier components along the rod ( x ) and the magnetocrystalline ( z ) axes, it can be seen that the shape anisotropy still contributes to the effective anisotropy, however, its strength is lowered as compared to the anisotropy created parallel to the rod’s diameter, i.e., increasing the diameter reinforces the effect of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy. The
CT
term contributes to
\(d{{\rm{\Sigma }}}_{M}^{\perp }/d{\rm{\Omega }}\)
only with a low signal, which is related to the small volume fraction of vortex cores (small
\({\tilde{M}}_{y}\)
contribution, compare middle image in Fig.  6 ). Interestingly, at the smallest
q , the
CT
term has inverted its sign compared to the
\(D=30\,{\rm{nm}}\)
and
\(D=60\,{\rm{nm}}\)
results, which may reflect an asymmetry of the magnetic configuration. In monocrystalline hcp Co nanowire arrays with
\(D/L=0.225\) , Ivanov
et al . 9 , 46
have demonstrated that, at remanence, the magnetic structure can be composed of multiple stable magnetic vortex domains with different chirality. Figure 6 Computed real-space spin structure of a
\(D=90\,{\rm{nm}}\)
nanorod at the remament state. The magnetization distributions are identical in all three images; the color scale encodes the different Cartesian components of
m
[compare inset in Fig.  3(c) ]. The wavy-like modulation of the nanorods’s shape is an artifact related to representation of the spatial dependence of the magnetization vector field via arrows. Full size image
The data for the individual Fourier components in Fig.  4
also reveal that these functions may explicitly depend on the angle
\(\theta \)
in the detector plane. For bulk ferromagnets, it has been demonstrated by means of micromagnetic simulations that such an angular anisotropy is related to the magnetodipolar interaction 39 , 40 , 41 , 42 . We emphasize that the possible
\(\theta \) -dependency of the Fourier components adds on top of the trigonometric functions in the magnetic SANS cross sections [equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 )], which are due to the dipolar nature of the neutron-magnetic matter interaction. In order to grasp the deviation between the standard model [equation ( 1 )] and the spin-misalignment SANS into one single parameter, we introduce the function $$\eta ({H}_{0})=\frac{d{{\rm{\Sigma }}}_{M}}{d{\rm{\Omega }}}({q}^{\ast },{H}_{0})/\frac{d{{\rm{\Sigma }}}_{M}}{d{\rm{\Omega }}}({q}^{\ast },{H}_{0}\to \infty ),$$
(3)
which describes the normalized variation of the azimuthally-averaged magnetic SANS cross section
\(d{{\rm{\Sigma }}}_{M}/d{\rm{\Omega }}\)
with the applied magnetic field. Figure  7
shows the results for
\(\eta ({H}_{0})\)
obtained by computing
\(d{{\rm{\Sigma }}}_{M}/d{\rm{\Omega }}\)
of the Co nanorod for both scattering geometries and for several
H
0 -values between positive and negative saturation with and without magnetocrystalline anisotropy. For the computation of
\(\eta \) , the average intensity at the respective characteristic
q -value of
\({q}^{\ast }=2\pi /D\)
was used. The behavior of
\(\eta ({H}_{0})\)
for a
uniformly
magnetized shape-anisotropic nanoparticle [cf. the discussion regarding equation ( 1 )] and for the two scattering geometries can be understood within the context of the Stoner-Wohlfarth model 52 : for
\({{\bf{k}}}_{0}\parallel {{\bf{H}}}_{0}\)
(corresponding to the case that the rod’s long axis is parallel to
H
0 ), the magnetization curve exhibits the well-known rectangular shape, implying that
M
points always along the
z -direction; there is, of course, a switching from the + z
to the − z
direction at the nucleation field, but this feature appears to be too “sharp” to be resolved with the SANS technique. As a consequence, the scattering vector
q
is always perpendicular to
M , so that the expectation value of the
\({\sin }^{2}\alpha \)
factor in equation ( 1 ) equals unity and the function
\(\eta ({H}_{0})\)
does
not
depend on the field; the corresponding scattering pattern is isotropic. For
\({{\bf{k}}}_{0}\perp {{\bf{H}}}_{0}\)
(corresponding to the case that the rod’s long axis is perpendicular to
H
0 ), the Stoner-Wohlfarth model predicts a linear paramagnetic-like decrease from saturation (along the horizontal
z -direction) to a zero remanent magnetization, where now (due to the shape anisotropy) the magnetization points along the wire axis ( x -direction). The expectation value of
\({\sin }^{2}\alpha \)
changes from a value of 1/2 at saturation to a value of 1 at
\({H}_{0}=0\) , in other words,
\(\eta ({H}_{0})\)
increases from 1 to a value of 2. Figure 7 The function

The above described idealized Stoner-Wohlfarth scenario is fairly well reproduced by our simulations for the smallest diameter of
\(D=30\,{\rm{nm}}\)
[black curves in Fig.  7 ; compare also Fig.  5(a) ]; the very small deviations from
\(\eta =2\)
in the perpendicular geometry [ \({K}_{u}\ne 0\) ; Fig.  7(c) ] and from
\(\eta =1\)
in the parallel geometry [ \({K}_{u}\ne 0\) ; Fig.  7(d) ] are attributed to the small spin-misalignment scattering that is related to the spin disorder at the end faces of the cylinder [compare insets in Fig.  3(a) ]. For the two largest diameters (60 nm and 90 nm), we observe a significant deviation from the Stoner-Wohlfarth prediction [and therefore also from the standard model, equation ( 1 )] due to the emerging spin-disorder scattering [blue and red curves in Fig.  7 ; compare Fig.  5b , c ]. While for both
\({K}_{u}=0\)
cases and for
\({K}_{u}\ne 0\)
in the parallel geometry we observe the trend that the spin-inhomogeneity parameter increases with increasing
\(D/L\) , the behavior of
\(\eta ({H}_{0})\)
is different for
\({K}_{u}\ne 0\)
in the perpendicular geometry [Fig.  7(c) ]; here, the
\(D=90\,{\rm{nm}}\)
rod exhibts a variation which is much smaller than the one of the
\(D=60\,{\rm{nm}}\)
cylinder. This observation indicates that the magnitude of the spin-misalignment scattering of nanorods depends sensitively on their domain structure, which is determined by the nanoparticle’s geometry (ratio
D / L ) and by the magnetic interactions, including the applied-field direction (compare also the Fourier images in Fig.  4 ). All in all, the results depicted in Fig.  7
reveal–for not too small nanoparticles–significant deviations from the standard model due to internal spin disorder. In order to account for these inhomogeneous spin structures and to understand the associated complex scattering patterns, micromagnetic simulations provide the key tool set for progressing the understanding of magnetic SANS on nanoparticles. Conclusion and Outlook We have presented the results of micromagnetic simulations of the magnetic microstructure and the ensuing magnetic small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) cross section of a single Co nanorod with a length of
\(L=500\,{\rm{nm}}\)
and diameters of
\(D=\mathrm{30,}\,60\)
and 90 nm. This methodology has allowed us to unravel the intrinsic contribution of the spin misalignment to the total magnetic SANS cross section via the study of the individual magnetization Fourier components; it provides important fundamental information regarding the explicit
q -dependence of
\(d{{\rm{\Sigma }}}_{M}/d{\rm{\Omega }}\)
as a function of the applied magnetic field, the nanoparticle’s microstructure, and the magnetic interactions. We anticipate that our investigation represents a starting point towards the development of a framework for computer-simulations-supported SANS-data analyses of magnetic nanoparticle assemblies exhibiting strong internal spin misalignment; for such systems, the classical geometrical description of magnetic SANS in terms of particle form factors is not appropriate (as embodied e.g. in Fig.  7 ), since in this approach the underlying magnetic problem is not addressed. Although the continuum theory of micromagnetics has been used in this paper, the framework can be easily extended to atomistic spin models 53 . Likewise, future simulation work–besides studying other particle shapes such as ellipsoids–will concentrate on (i) the scrutiny of the periodicity of the Fourier coefficients and their relation to the real-space spin structure, (ii) the study of interparticle interactions, which will then allow for a comparison of simulation results to experimental data, (iii) the inclusion of random variations of the magnetic anisotropy field in order to better describe microstructural defects (polycrystallinity), (iv) the inclusion of thermal fluctuations, and (v) the study of the magnetization dynamics by solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. Methods Magnetic SANS cross section The quantity of interest in our micromagnetic study is the elastic magnetic differential scattering cross section
\(d{{\rm{\Sigma }}}_{M}/d{\rm{\Omega }}\) , which is usually recorded on a two-dimensional position-sensitive detector. For the most commonly used scattering geometries in magnetic SANS experiments (see Fig.  1 ), where the applied magnetic field
\({{\bf{H}}}_{0}\,\parallel \,{{\bf{e}}}_{z}\)
is either perpendicular ( \({{\bf{k}}}_{0}\perp {{\bf{H}}}_{0}\) ) or parallel ( \({{\bf{k}}}_{0}\,\parallel \,{{\bf{H}}}_{0}\) ) to the wave vector
k
0
of the incident neutrons,
\(d{{\rm{\Sigma }}}_{M}/d{\rm{\Omega }}\)
for unpolarized neutrons can be written as 31 : $$\frac{d{{\rm{\Sigma }}}_{M}^{\perp }}{d{\rm{\Omega }}}({\bf{q}})=\frac{8{\pi }^{3}}{V}{b}_{H}^{2}[|\tilde{{M}_{x}}{|}^{2}+|\tilde{{M}_{y}}{|}^{2}{\cos }^{2}\theta +|\tilde{{M}_{z}}{|}^{2}{\sin }^{2}\theta -(\tilde{{M}_{y}^{\ast }}\tilde{{M}_{z}}+\tilde{{M}_{z}^{\ast }}\tilde{{M}_{y}})\sin \,\theta \,\cos \,\theta ],$$

\({\bf{q}}\cong q\mathrm{(0,}\,\sin \,\theta ,\,\cos \,\theta )\)
for
\({{\bf{k}}}_{0}\perp {{\bf{H}}}_{0}\) , where
\(\theta \)
denotes the angle between
q
and
H
0 , whereas
\(q\cong q(\cos \,\theta ,\,\sin \,\theta \mathrm{,\; 0)}\)
for
\({{\bf{k}}}_{0}\,\parallel \,{{\bf{H}}}_{0}\) , where
\(\theta \)
is measured between
q
and
e
x
. These expressions demonstrate that SANS mainly probes correlations in the plane normal to
k
0 . The applied field
H
0
defines the
z -axis of a Cartesian laboratory coordinate system for both geometries. Since the focus of this study is on magnetic (spin-misalignment) scattering, we have ignored the nuclear SANS contribution, which for a homogeneous particle can be described by the particle form factor. The magnetization Fourier amplitudes depend on the size and shape of the particle, but most importantly on the magnetic interactions determining the nanoparticle’s spin structure. Using computer simulations based on the continuum theory of micromagnetics it becomes possible to include all the relevant intraparticle magnetic interactions such as magnetic anisotropy, magnetostatics, and exchange interaction. For a saturated nanoparticle, expressions (4) and (5) reduce to equations of the form of equation ( 1 ). With the aid of polarized neutrons it becomes possible to access nuclear-magnetic interference terms as well as purely chiral magnetic contributions. Micromagnetic simulations We have performed micromagnetic simulations using the GPU-based open-source software package MuMax3 54 , which can calculate the space and time-dependent magnetic microstructure of nano- and micron-sized ferromagnets. Mumax3 employs a finite-difference discretization scheme of space using a two-dimensional or three-dimensional grid of orthorhombic cells. In the micromagnetic simulations we have taken into account all four standard contributions to the total magnetic Gibbs free energy: energy in the external magnetic field
\({ {\mathcal E} }_{Z}\) , magnetodipolar interaction energy
\({ {\mathcal E} }_{D}\) , energy of the (uniaxial) magnetocrystalline anisotropy
\({ {\mathcal E} }_{{\rm{ani}}}\) , and isotropic and symmetric exchange energy
\({ {\mathcal E} }_{{\rm{ex}}}\) : $${ {\mathcal E} }_{Z}=-{\mu }_{0}{\int }_{V}{\bf{M}}\cdot {{\bf{H}}}_{0}\,dV,\quad { {\mathcal E} }_{D}=-\frac{1}{2}{\mu }_{0}{\int }_{V}{\bf{M}}\cdot {{\bf{H}}}_{D}dV,\quad { {\mathcal E} }_{{\rm{ani}}}=-{\int }_{V}{K}_{u}{({\bf{m}}\cdot {\bf{u}})}^{2}dV,\quad { {\mathcal E} }_{{\rm{ex}}}={\int }_{V}A{(\nabla {\bf{m}})}^{2}dV,$$
(6)
where
\({\bf{m}}({\bf{r}})={\bf{M}}({\bf{r}})/{M}_{s}\)
denotes the unit magnetization vector with
M
s
the saturation magnetization,
H
0
is the (constant) applied magnetic field,
\({{\bf{H}}}_{D}({\bf{r}})\)
is the magnetostatic field,
\({K}_{u}\)
is the (first-order) uniaxial anisotropy constant,
u
is a unit vector indicating the anisotropy-axis direction,
A
is the exchange-stiffness constant,
\({\mu }_{0}\)
denotes the permeability of free space, and the integrals are taken over the volume of the nanorod. The nanorod is represented as a cylinder with a fixed length of
\(L=500\,{\rm{nm}}\) , but with different diameters
D
(30, 60, and 90 nm); these dimensions are typical of real materials 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 . The magnetic materials parameters were set to the ones corresponding to bulk hcp Co 55 :
\({M}_{s}=1.44\times {10}^{6}\,{\rm{A}}/{\rm{m}}\) ,
\({K}_{u}=4.5\times {10}^{5}\,{\rm{J}}/{{\rm{m}}}^{{\rm{3}}}\) , and
\(A=2.8\times {10}^{-11}\,{\rm{J}}/{\rm{m}}\) ; these values result in a magnetostatic exchange length of
\({l}_{{\rm{ex}}}=\sqrt{2A/({\mu }_{0}{M}_{s}^{2})}=4.6\,{\rm{nm}}\)
and in a domain-wall parameter of
\({l}_{K}=\sqrt{A/{K}_{u}}=7.9\,{\rm{nm}}\) . Correspondingly, a cubic cell with a side length of 2 nm was used in order to discretize the nanorod. The
\({K}_{u}\) -axis orientation with respect to the nanorods’s long axis was chosen in-plane along the nanorod’s diameter ( \({\bf{u}}=\mathrm{\{0,0,}\pm \mathrm{1\}}\)
for
\({{\bf{k}}}_{0}\perp {{\bf{H}}}_{0}\)
and
\({\bf{u}}=\{\pm \mathrm{1,0,0\}}\)
for
\({{\bf{k}}}_{0}\,\parallel \,{{\bf{H}}}_{0}\) ), in agreement with experimental observations which report a strong crystal anisotropy with an easy axis oriented nearly perpendicular to the axis of the wire (e.g., ref. 56 ). The hysteresis loops were calculated as follows: the magnetic system was initially completely saturated by aligning the magnetic moments of all the computational cells along the
z -axis. Then, the applied field was reduced in steps of 5 mT and the equilibrium magnetization state at each
H
0
(and therefore the static spin configuration) was found by two equivalent methods; we employed both the “Relax” and “Minimize” functions of Mumax3, where the former solves the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation without the precessional term and the latter uses the conjugate-gradient method to find the configuration of minimum energy. The translational invariance of the grid obtained with the finite-difference method enables the usage of the Fast Fourier transformation technique for the computation of the Fourier components of the magnetization. We have used the FFTW library 57
to compute and analyze the Fourier components of our nanoscopic magnetic configurations. Thermal fluctuations were not taken into account in the simulations.

Abstract
Perovskite photovoltaics have attracted remarkable attention recently due to their exceptional power conversion efficiencies (PCE). State-of-the-art perovskite absorbers typically require thermal annealing steps for high film quality. However, the annealing process adds cost and reduces yield for device fabrication and may also hinder application in tandem photovoltaics and flexible/ultra-low-cost optoelectronics. Herein, we report an additive-based room-temperature process for realizing high-quality methylammonium lead iodide films with micron-sized grains (>2 μm) and microsecond-range carrier lifetimes ( τ 1
= 931.94 ± 89.43 ns;
τ 2
= 320.41 ± 43.69 ns). Solar cells employing such films demonstrate 18.22% PCE with improved current–voltage hysteresis and stability without encapsulation. Further, we reveal that room-temperature-processed perovskite film grain size strongly depends on the precursor aggregate size in the film-deposition solution and that additive-based tuning of aggregate properties enables enlarging grains to the micron scale. These results offer a new pathway for more versatile, cost-effective perovskite processing.

Abstract Metal halide perovskite materials are an emerging class of solution-processable semiconductors with considerable potential for use in optoelectronic devices 1 , 2 , 3 . For example, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on these materials could see application in flat-panel displays and solid-state lighting, owing to their potential to be made at low cost via facile solution processing, and could provide tunable colours and narrow emission line widths at high photoluminescence quantum yields 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 . However, the highest reported external quantum efficiencies of green- and red-light-emitting perovskite LEDs are around 14 per cent 7 , 9
and 12 per cent 8 , respectively—still well behind the performance of organic LEDs 10 , 11 , 12
and inorganic quantum dot LEDs 13 . Here we describe visible-light-emitting perovskite LEDs that surpass the quantum efficiency milestone of 20 per cent. This achievement stems from a new strategy for managing the compositional distribution in the device—an approach that simultaneously provides high luminescence and balanced charge injection. Specifically, we mixed a presynthesized CsPbBr 3
perovskite with a MABr additive (where MA is CH 3 NH 3 ), the differing solubilities of which yield sequential crystallization into a CsPbBr 3 /MABr quasi-core/shell structure. The MABr shell passivates the nonradiative defects that would otherwise be present in CsPbBr 3
crystals, boosting the photoluminescence quantum efficiency, while the MABr capping layer enables balanced charge injection. The resulting 20.3 per cent external quantum efficiency represents a substantial step towards the practical application of perovskite LEDs in lighting and display.

Main MAPbI 3− x Cl x
and MAPbBr 3
were used in early perovskite LEDs that achieved external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 0.76% and 0.1% for the near-infrared and green regimes, respectively 14 . Two strategies 5 , 6 , 7 , 15
have since led to notable improvements in LED performance. The first strategy involves direct spin-coating of colloidal perovskite nanocrystals 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 ; these nanocrystals are highly luminescent with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of nearly 90%, and their optical properties can be tuned by compositional engineering and crystal size. The second approach requires deposition of bulk perovskite films using perovskite precursor solutions whose composition can be suitably engineered (for example, stoichiometrically modified MAPbBr 3 6
and MAPbX 3
with the addition of long-chain ammonium halides 5
or 1-naphthylmethylamine halides 8 ). Here we have built on prior works and pursued a new strategy for generating still higher EQEs. Our approach was to combine a high PLQY with balanced charge injection by constructing a compositionally graded perovskite based on a quasi-core/shell structure: the bottom part consists of perovskite light-emitting polycrystals capped with a defect-passivation layer that passivates the grain boundaries; and the top part serves to passivate the surface and simultaneously balance charge injection into the perovskite LED device. We used the very different solubility and crystallinity of perovskite (CsPbBr 3 ) and passivant (MABr) in polar solvent and—through a one-step deposition method—fabricated in situ the compositionally graded material. This consisted of a defect-passivated perovskite layer on the bottom (CsPbBr 3 /MABr) and an electrical passivating layer (MABr) on top. The resulting highly luminescent perovskite films and balanced charge injection enabled  the development of perovskite LED devices with an initial EQE of 17%. We further improved the device charge injection balance by inserting an insulating layer of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) between the perovskite layer and the electron-transfer layer (ETL), thereby maximizing the device efficiency at 20.3%. We synthesized a CsPbBr 3
perovskite powder as a starting material, and then added MABr. We engineered the amount of MABr additive to improve perovskite film formation and PLQY (for example, ‘mixture 1.0’ signifies that the molar ratio of MABr to CsPbBr 3
is 1). Figure  1a
shows three different perovskite structures fabricated using a strategy that we term compositional distribution management: single-layered CsPbBr 3
(prepared by one-step spin-coating); bilayered CsPbBr 3 /MABr (prepared by coating another layer of MABr on the as-formed CsPbBr 3
layer); and quasi-core/shell CsPbBr 3 /MABr (mixture 1.0). Figure  1b
and Extended Data Fig.  1
show that the capping layer of MABr (in the bilayered structure) only slightly enhances photoluminescence emission, while the mixture-1.0 film with quasi-core/shell structure presents very bright photoluminescence emission (see Supplementary Information, video S 1 ). We found an enhancement of photoluminescence proportional to the amount of MABr additive when the molar ratio of MABr to CsPbBr 3
was increased from 0.4 to 1.0; photoluminescence began to decrease when the molar ratio was increased beyond 1.0 (Extended Data Fig.  1 ). Fig. 1: Enhancing photoluminescence through compositional distribution management. a , Schematic illustrations of single-layered CsPbBr 3 , bilayered CsPbBr 3 /MABr, and quasi-core/shell CsPbBr 3 /MABr structures, all fabricated on ITO substrates.

d , Cross-sectional TEM image of the quasi-core/shell CsPbBr 3 /MABr structure on PEDOT:PSS. White arrows indicate the MABr shell (the grain boundary). The sample was prepared using a focused ion beam, and the top C layer was predeposited in order to protect the perovskite. Full size image We observed that, during film formation, CsPbBr 3
crystallized rapidly, whereas MABr sequentially increased its crystallization rate after the CsPbBr 3
precursor was completely consumed (Extended Data Fig.  1d ). We explain this by noting that the solubility of CsPbBr 3
(which we find to be 0.56 M) is far below than that of MABr (5 M) in dimethylsulfoxidde (DMSO). Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) depth analysis (Fig.  1c ) supports the CsPbBr 3 /MABr gradient structure. From the SIMS results, one can see that the top layer contains CH 4 N +
ions (from the capping MABr; stage Ι); the middle layer comprises Pb +
ions with few CH 4 N +
ions (from CsPbBr 3
and MABr; stage ΙΙ); and the bottom layer consists of In +
ions (from the indium tin oxide (ITO) used as the support; stage ΙΙΙ). To gain insight into the compositional distribution of the as-formed mixture-1.0 films, we carried out cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies. We prepared the cross-sectional TEM samples by using a focused ion beam, with C and Pt layers predeposited in order to protect the perovskite from possible ion-beam-induced damage. The cross-sectional SEM image (Extended Data Fig.  2a ) shows a high-quality perovskite film with obvious grain boundaries. The cross-sectional TEM and element-mapping images (Fig.  1d
and Extended Data Fig.  2b ) show a well defined layer-by-layer structure, with ITO at the bottom, topped with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), then with CsPbBr 3 , MABr and finally C. A shell of MABr can be seen in the grain boundaries of CsPbBr 3
(white arrows in Fig.  1d ), and another layer of MABr caps the CsPbBr 3 , forming the quasi-core/shell structure. We sought to estimate experimentally the trap state density of the three classes of perovskite samples. We found (Extended Data Fig.  3a ) that the MABr shell reduces defects in the mixture-1.0 perovskite films by a factor of four compared with the single-layered CsPbBr 3
film. To gain insight into the effect of the thick upper layer of MABr on photoluminescence enhancement, we washed the bright perovskite film using anhydrous isopropyl alcohol (IPA) solvent, and observed that the photoluminescence decreased gradually as the MABr was removed (Extended Data Fig.  3b ). To make a direct comparison, we also prepared pure CsPbBr 3
and MAPbBr 3
perovskite films. As shown in Extended Data Fig.  3c , all perovskite films show a transparent yellow colour under room illumination. However, only the mixture-1.0 perovskite films reveal high brightness under ultraviolet-lamp excitation. The ultraviolet/visible absorbance spectra (Extended Data Fig.  3d ) of the mixture-1.0 film present a band-edge absorbance at 531 nm, similar to CsPbBr 3
(528 nm), corresponding to a bandgap of 2.33 eV. Analysis of the photoluminescence spectra of the three perovskite samples indicates that emission from the mixture-1.0 film is close to the emission of pure-CsPbBr 3
films (Extended Data Fig.  3e ). In order to quantify the photoluminescence enhancement induced by the MABr additive, we measured the absolute PLQY according to a reported protocol 20 . We determined that the PLQY of the mixture-1.0 perovskite film was about 80%, while the PLQYs of CsPbBr 3
and MAPbBr 3
are not detectable (from an analysis of our system signal-to-noise ratio, we conclude that their PLQYs lie below 1%). Time-resolved photoluminescence spectra (Extended Data Fig.  3f ) show that the mixture-1.0 film has a 50% longer radiative lifetime than that of pure CsPbBr 3 , and that the longer lifetime of the photoluminescence transition is direct evidence of a decrease in the concentration of defects and an increase in film crystallinity 1 , 7 , 9 . We attribute the long lifetime of photoluminescence to the fact that the compositionally graded structure combined with the MABr shell passivates the nonradiative defects in CsPbBr 3 . We analysed the crystal structure of the perovskite films using X-ray diffraction (XRD; Extended Data Fig.  4a ). We conclude that the mixture-1.0 perovskite exhibits the same crystal structure as monoclinic CsPbBr 3 , instead of a mixture of separate phases of CsPbBr 3
and MAPbBr 3 . X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data (Extended Data Fig.  4b, c ) also indicate the existence of CsPbBr 3
and MABr in the mixture-1.0 perovskite film. The perovskite layer requires high surface coverage and low roughness in order to achieve high-performance LEDs. We characterized the surface morphology of the pure CsPbBr 3 , MAPbBr 3
and mixture-1.0 perovskite films using SEM and atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Extended Data Fig.  5 ). We observed small particles and pinholes in the CsPbBr 3
and MAPbBr 3
films; by contrast, in the mixture-1.0 film, smooth and well packed micrometre-sized cuboids were combined with good crystallinity. We fabricated perovskite LEDs consisting of single-layered CsPbBr 3 , single-layered MAPbBr 3 , bilayered CsPbBr 3
and MABr, or mixture-1.0 perovskites with a quasi-core/shell structure, based on a device structure consisting of layered ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/B3PYMPM/LiF/Al (Fig.  2a , where B3PYMPM is C 37 H 26 N 6 ). PEDOT:PSS served as the hole-transfer layer (HTL), B3PYMPM as the ETL, LiF as an electron-injection layer and Al as the cathode (Extended Data Fig.  6a ). Photographs of mixture-1.0 perovskite LED devices with six uniform and bright green-emitting pixels (2 mm × 1.5 mm) are shown in Fig.  2b . Larger-area devices (6 mm × 20 mm; Extended Data Fig.  6b ) showcase uniform and bright emission.

f , EQE–voltage characteristics of the best-performing mixture-1.0 perovskite LED. Full size image The device performance of bilayered CsPbBr 3 /MABr perovskite is quite limited (Extended Data Fig.  6c )—only slightly better than that of the single-layered CsPbBr 3 —possibly because of its low PLQY and poor surface morphology. The mixture-1.0 devices display an emission peak at 525 nm with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 20 nm (Extended Data Fig.  6d, e ), corresponding to a CIE colour-space coordinates of (0.18, 0.75). We collected current-density–voltage ( J – V ) and luminance–voltage ( L – V ) curves in order to evaluate the LED performance (Extended Data Fig.  6f–h ). Devices fabricated using mixture 1.0 exhibited the lowest current density at the same time as the highest luminance, indicating the best performance among our three classes of perovskite LED. The mixture-1.0 devices gave a maximum current efficiency of 23 cd A −1
at 3.8 V—fully three orders of magnitude higher than the current efficiency of the pure CsPbBr 3 - and MAPbBr 3 -based LEDs (Fig.
2c ). We posited that the superior LED performance of the mixture-1.0 devices arises not only from the high PLQY, but also from its combination with improved charge injection balance. To quantify charge injection, we measured the
J – V
scharacteristics of electron-only devices (ITO/B3PYMPM/perovskite/B3PYMPM/Al) or hole-only devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/Au) (Fig.  2d ). We conclude that electrons dominate injection into the pure-CsPbBr 3
devices, whereas a more balanced charge injection occurs in the case of mixture-1.0 devices. After optimization, we obtained an average current efficiency of 35 cd A −1
from 20 devices, with the best current efficiency reaching 65 cd A −1
(Fig.  2e ). The EQE –V
characteristics of the best-performing device show a maximum EQE of 17% at 4.2 V (Fig.  2f )—a record for a green-emitting perovskite LED. Figure  2d
shows that the capping MABr layer in the quasi-core/shell structure helps to reduce electron injection and improve charge balance. We thought that further improvement could potentially be realized through additional optimization of charge balance. We achieved this by depositing a thin PMMA layer on the as-formed perovskite. We then tested electron-only and hole-only device performance again, and found that the PMMA layer further helps in balancing charge injection (Fig.  3a ). We therefore inserted a thin PMMA layer between the perovskite and ETL (Fig.  3b
and Extended Data Fig.  7a ). We found the PMMA to be continuous and smooth (Extended Data Fig.  7b, c ), enabling charge injection into perovskite via tunnelling 13 . After we optimized the thickness of the PMMA layer and the molar ratio between MABr and CsPbBr 3
in the mixed perovskite precursor (Extended Data Fig.  7d, e ), the devices reached a higher current efficiency of 78 cd A −1
(Fig.  3c ). Fig. 3: Enhancing the performance of perovskite LEDs by inserting a thin PMMA layer between the perovskite and the ETL. a , Current density–voltage ( J – V ) curves of electron-only and hole-only devices with a PMMA layer.

f , Lifetime measurements of the best-performing mixture-1.0 perovskite LED device. A constant driving current of 5 mA (167 mA cm −2 ) led to the luminance increasing from 3,800 cd m −2
to 7,130 cd m −2
( L 0 ) and then diminishing. We estimate this device’s
T 50
at 100 cd m −2
to be about 104.56 h. Full size image Figure  3d
presents the
J –V
and
L –V
curves of the best-performing mixture-1.0 device, showing a low driving current density and high luminance of 14,000 cd m −2 . A low turn-on voltage of 2.7 V—just slightly higher than the bandgap of the mixture-1.0 perovskite—is obtained because of the high quality of the perovskite thin film and the more efficient carrier injection from the HTL and ETL. We also found that the electroluminescence spectra at different applied voltages remained the same, and that the maximum power efficiency was 69 lm W −1
at 3.6 V (Extended Data Fig.  8 ). A maximum EQE value of 20.3% is achieved with a luminance of 3,400 cd m −2
(Fig.  3e
and Supplementary Information, videos S 2
and S 3 ). We measured the lifetime of the device by applying a constant current and monitoring the evolution of luminance 13 , 21 . After we applied a constant driving current of 5 mA (167 mA cm −2 ), the luminance increased from 3,800 cd m −2
to 7,130 cd m −2
( L 0 ) in 0.66 min and then began to diminish (Fig.  3f ). The half-lifetime ( T 50 )—defined as the time taken for the luminance to decrease to
L 0 /2—was about 10 min. By using a calculation of
\({L}_{0}^{n}{T}_{50}={\rm{constant}}\) , and assuming an acceleration factor of
n  = 1.5 (ref.
13 ; Extended Data Fig.  9a ), we estimate this device’s
T 50
at 100 cd m −2
to be about 100 h—to our knowledge, the highest value estimated to date in high-performance perovskite LEDs, and an important step towards practical application. We also measured the stability of the device under continuous operation with luminance maintained at a constant value of about 100 cd m −2 , achieved by tuning the applied current to maintain luminance. The results (see Supplementary Information, video S 4 , and Extended Data Fig.  9b ) show that the device could operate continuously for about 46 h, a similar order of magnitude to the extrapolated value from the accelerated ageing test. The corresponding EQE decreased from 13% to 5.6% over these 46 hours of continuous operation, indicating that the device did degrade even at this low luminance. Nonetheless, the stability performance shown here is two to three orders of magnitude higher than previous reported values 7 , 9 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25
(Extended Data Table  1 ). In summary, we have demonstrated a new strategy for realizing compositionally graded perovskite devices that simultaneously achieve high PLQY and balanced charge injection. Our approach exploits the differing solubilities of perovskite precursors to control the crystallization of CsPbBr 3 /MABr gradient structure in a single step. The MABr shell passivates nonradiative defect sites in CsPbBr 3
crystals, and the MABr capping layer balances charge injection. These effects together allow us to achieve perovskite LEDs with a narrow green emission, exhibiting a record EQE that surpasses 20%. This high EQE is now on a par with those of more mature technologies such as organic LEDs. Improvements in device stability remain a challenge, and strides in that direction might be achieved by suppressing ion migration with additives or a blocking layer, fabricating a high-quality perovskite layer, and further optimizing the perovskite/ETL and perovskite/HTL interfaces 26 , 27 , 28 . Methods Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Preparation of perovskite precursor We first synthesized CsPbBr 3
powder and used it as a starting material for precursor preparation. Specifically, we dissolved PbBr 2
(10 mmol, 3.67 g) in hydrobromic acid (8 ml), then added CsBr (10 mmol, 2.12 g, dissolved in 3 ml of water) drop by drop, producing an orange precipitate. The precipitate was filtered, washed twice using ethanol, and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 12 h before use. CH 3 NH 3 Br (abbreviated to MABr) was prepared by reacting 12 ml of methylamine (33 wt.% in absolute ethanol) and 11 ml of hydrobromic acid (48 wt.% in H 2 O) in an ice bath for 2 h with continuous stirring. The solvent was removed using rotary evaporation at 50 °C to obtain a white MABr powder. For purification, the as-prepared MABr powder was re-dissolved in ethanol and precipitated with diethyl ether. Finally, the white powder was collected by filtration and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for at least 12 h before use. The MAPbBr 3
precursor was prepared by dissolving PbBr 2
and MABr (1:1 molar ratio) in DMSO solvent to make a 0.5 M solution. CsPbBr 3
powder can be fully dissolved in DMSO solvent to make a 0.5 M starting solution. Then, different amounts of MABr were added to the as-prepared CsPbBr 3
solution to make a mixture perovskite precursor, with the mixture being named through the molar ratio of MABr to CsPbBr 3 . For example, to prepare a precursor of mixture 1.0, 55.98 mg of MABr (0.5 mmol) was added to 1 ml of the as-prepared CsPbBr 3
(0.5 mmol) solution. Fabrication of perovskite LEDs Prepatterned ITO glasses (20 mm × 20 mm) were ultrasonically washed in, sequentially, detergent solution, deionized water, acetone and ethanol, and then dried with compressed N 2 . The substrates were further cleaned with UV-Ozone cleaner (Novascan, PSD) for 30 min before spin-coating. A 40-nm-thick HTL was prepared by spin-coating using PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PV P AI4083) at 4,000 r.p.m. for 60 s and baking at 150 °C for another 15 min. After cooling to room temperature, the substrates were transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove box (H 2 O less than 1 part per million (p.p.m.); O 2
less than 1 p.p.m) for deposition of the perovskite layer. The perovskite layer was prepared through the same spin-coating procedures but used a different precursor solution. Specifically, 30 µl of perovskite precursor was dropped onto the substrate and spun at 2,000 r.p.m. for 60 s, during which time (at 30 s) 500 µl of toluene was dropped quickly onto the surface. Another thin layer of PMMA blocking layer was prepared if needed: 50 µl of PMMA solution (0.5 mg ml −1
in acetone) was spin-coated onto the as-prepared perovskite layer at 4,000 r.p.m. for 60 s. There was no annealing process and the as-prepared substrates were transferred into a thermal evaporator. The chamber was vacuum-pumped down to 5.0 × 10 −4  Pa, and a 40-nm-thick layer of B3PYMPM (Lumtec, Taiwan), 2-nm-thick layer of LiF and 100-nm-thick layer of Al were sequentially evaporated. We defined the area of the perovskite LED device as the area of overlap between the ITO and the Al electrode; it is 3 mm 2
(2 mm × 1.5 mm). We also used a charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera to measure the actual device area. Material characterization We characterized surface morphologies by field-emission SEM (using a Hitachi S-8000 scanning electron microscope). To determine the distribution of ions in the perovskite film, we used TOF-SIMS (ION-TOF GmbH, ToF SIMS V). We characterized bright-field, high-angle annular dark field, and element-mapping images with a FEI Talos F200S transmission electron microscope. We prepared the perovskite sample for TEM observations with a focused ion beam (FEI Scios); protective layers of C and Pt were deposited before ion-beam cutting and etching. We recorded XRD patterns using a D8 Advance diffractometer (Bruker AXS). Ultraviolet/visible and steady-state photoluminescence spectra were acquired using a Flame spectrometer (Ocean Optics) in a glovebox. We measured PLQYs using a blue excitation laser (405 nm), an integrating sphere and a Flame spectrometer. Photoluminescence decay curves were measured using a fluorescence lifetime imaging microscope (FLIM, Leca TCS SP8) with a pulsed excitation laser of 405 nm. Performance evaluation of perovskite LEDs We inserted the as-fabricated perovskite LED devices into a home-made test socket and took measurements in a glovebox (Supplementary Information, videos S 2
and S 3 , from which we can see that the luminance loss caused by light absorbance and reflection of the glove box glass is 16%). Using a Keithley 2400 instrument, we measured
J – V
data from 0 V to 5 V with a step voltage of 0.2 V and delay time of 3 s; simultaneously, we measured the luminance using a luminance meter (Konica Minolta, LS-160 or CS-200). Electroluminescence characteristics were recorded with a Flame spectrometer (Ocean Optic). The current efficiency was calculated by dividing the luminance by the current density. The EQE was calculated using Lambertian emission profiles and the obtained electroluminescence spectra. The initial high-performance device with an EQE of 16% was first investigated by the Nanyang Technological University group; the electroluminscence characteristics were further studied there as well. Measurement of device lifetime by accelerated ageing Prior studies have shown that the product of the initial luminance ( L 0 ) of the lifetime measurement and the
T 50
lifetime (defined as the time when the luminance drops to 50% of
L 0 ) is a constant:
\({L}_{0}^{n}\times {T}_{50}={\rm{constant}}\) , where the
n
is the acceleration factor. The
n
factor can be determined experimentally by running lifetime tests for different
L 0
values. The equation can be rewritten in the form: log T 50  =  K  –  n log L 0 . In this way,
n
is obtained as the slope of the linear fitting curve of the various measured
T 50
and
L 0
values. Measurement of operational lifetime (constant luminance) As shown in Supplementary Information, video S 4 , we could maintain the luminance of our perovskite LED devices at around 100 cd cm −2
by carefully tuning the applied current. In other words, we had to increase the applied current a little bit once an obvious decrease in luminance was observed. The device worked steadily for around 46 h, and then began to degrade rapidly.

Abstract
Today's best perovskite solar cells use a mixture of formamidinium and methylammonium as the monovalent cations. With the addition of inorganic cesium, the resulting triple cation perovskite compositions are thermally more stable, contain less phase impurities and are less sensitive to processing conditions. This enables more reproducible device performances to reach a stabilized power output of 21.1% and ∼18% after 250 hours under operational conditions. These properties are key for the industrialization of perovskite photovoltaics.

In order to find an upper theoretical limit for the efficiency of
p‐n
junction solar energy converters, a limiting efficiency, called the
detailed balance limit
of efficiency, has been calculated for an ideal case in which the only recombination mechanism of hole‐electron pairs is radiative as required by the principle of detailed balance. The efficiency is also calculated for the case in which radiative recombination is only a fixed fraction
f c
of the total recombination, the rest being nonradiative. Efficiencies at the matched loads have been calculated with band gap and
f c
as parameters, the sun and cell being assumed to be blackbodies with temperatures of 6000°K and 300°K, respectively. The maximum efficiency is found to be 30% for an energy gap of 1.1 ev and
f c
= 1. Actual junctions do not obey the predicted current‐voltage relationship, and reasons for the difference and its relevance to efficiency are discussed.

exp (qV/AkT)
with values of
A
as large as three. 12. Once a photon exceeds about three times the energy gap

the probability of producing two or more hole‐electron pairs becomes appreciable:

for an electron to produce a pair. However, the data can be well fitted up to quantum yields greater than two by assuming a threshold of only slightly more than
E g
and assuming the energy divides equally between the photohole and the photoelectron. This effect would slightly increase the possible quantum efficiency; however, we shall not consider it further in this article. Google Scholar Crossref Search ADS

18. Equations like (3.16) occur in published treatments of solar‐cell efficiency. The difference is that the term in
I sh
due to
F c0 ,
which is small but required by the principle of detailed balance, is included, and the coefficient of
I 0
is related to the fundamental minimum reverse saturation current rather than to a semi‐empirical value. 19. As for Eq. (3.16), factors like υ have been introduced by various authors, most recently by M. Wolf (see footnote 6). However, the forms are dependent upon additional semiempirical quantities so that they cannot be used for the purposes given in the introduction. 20. Similar maximization of the output power has been carried out in terms of the maximum area rectangle on the

plot by various authors, in particular W. G. Pfann and W. van Roosbroeck (See footnote 2). The results do not, however, appear to have been published in analytic form in which the matching factor

Abstract
We investigated the doping effect of bulky organic cations with ethylenediammonium diiodide (EDAI 2 ) and butylammonium iodide (BAI) as additives to passivate surface defects, to control the film morphology and to improve the crystallinity for inverted planar FASnI 3
perovskite solar cells. The addition of BAI altered significantly the orientation of crystal growth and improved the connectivity of the crystal grains, but the existence of pinholes in the surface of the pristine FASnI 3
films was unavoidable; this effect impeded further improvement of the device performance (PCE 5.5%), which is nevertheless superior to that of a pristine FASnI 3
film (PCE 4.0%). The addition of EDAI 2
had the effect of curing the pinhole problem, passivating the surface defect states, preventing Sn 2+ /Sn 4+
oxidation and inducing slow relaxation of the crystal structure. In the presence of the EDAI 2
additive (1%), the FASnI 3
device attained the best initial efficiency, 7.4%, and the device performance continuously increased as a function of duration of storage; the maximum PCE, 8.9%, was obtained for a device stored in a glove box for over 1400 h with only slight degradation for storage beyond 2000 h. The observed slow passivation of surface defects and relaxation of crystal strain were verified with X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and photoluminescence decay techniques.

The first order electric field correlation function of laser light scattered by polydisperse solutions of macromolecules can be written as a sum or distribution of exponentials, with decay rates proportional to the diffusion coefficients of the solute molecules. It is shown that the logarithm of this correlation function is formally equivalent to a cumulant generating function. A method is described by which the distribution function of the decay rates (and thus the extent of polydispersity) can be characterized, in a light scattering experiment, by calculation of the moments or cumulants. The systematic and random statistical errors in the calculated cumulants are discussed.

Stress Gradient Analysis by Noncomplanar x-Ray Diffraction and Corresponding Refraction Correction
Article Preview
Abstract:
X-ray residual stress analysis is a widespread nondestructive technique to investigate the residual stress and residual stress gradient in thin films and protective coatings.In the present contribution we introduce a new method based on the noncomplanar measurement geometry that allow to span large area of sin 2
ψ and penetration depth values without sample inclination. The refraction correction and absorption is considered in details for the noncomplanar measurements. The proposed technique is applied to determine stress gradients of blasted hard TiN coatings.

We have investigated GaAs-based
p - i - n
quantum dot solar cells (QDSCs) with 10 up to 20 stacked layers of self-assembled InAs quantum dots (QDs) grown by atomic hydrogen-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. The net average lattice strain was minimized by using the strain-compensation technique, in which GaNAs dilute nitrides were used as spacer layers. The filtered short-circuit current density beyond GaAs bandedge was
2.47   mA / cm 2
for strain-compensated QDSC with 20 stacks of InAs QD layers, which was four times higher than that for strained QDSC with identical cell structure.

Recently, low-dimensional semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) incorporated in the active region of a
p - i - n
junction solar cell (SC) have attracted intense research as a possible means of exploiting the sub-bandgap photons to generate an additional photocurrent beyond that corresponding to the band-to-band transition in a conventional single-junction SC. 1
In quantum dot solar cells (QDSCs), the QDs should be uniform in size and periodically distributed in all three dimensions, which lead to the formation of an intermediate band or a miniband rather than a multiplicity of discrete quantized levels in order to achieve the predicted high conversion efficiencies. 2
The experimental demonstration of QDSCs requires placing a three-dimensional (3D) QD superlattice in the active region. 3
The most popular fabrication technique of QDs is to take advantage of spontaneous self-assembly or self-organization mechanism of coherent 3D islanding during growth known as Stranski–Krastanov (S-K) growth in lattice-mismatched epitaxy. However, the S-K growth in InAs/GaAs system usually results in degradation of QD structure and generation of misfit dislocations, typically after 10 layers of stacking, as a result of accumulation of internal strain beyond the critical thickness. 4,5
Previously, we reported an InP-based QDSC with 30 stacked InAs/AlGaInAs QD layers on InP (311)B substrate fabricated using the strain-compensation technique. 6
Here the compressive strain due to the QD layer was compensated by a tensile strain induced by the spacer layer 7–10
and the size dispersion improved to
12 % – 13 % ⁠ . 11
Recently, this technique has been applied to InAs/GaNAs material system fabricated on a more cost-effective GaAs substrate. 12
This work reports on the basic result of InAs/GaNAs QDSCs fabricated using the strain-compensation technique.
We fabricated four series of SCs—S1, S2, S3, and S4—on
n + -GaAs (001) substrates by atomic hydrogen-assisted molecular beam epitaxy with a radio frequency plasma as the nitrogen source. 13,14
The four samples were identical in the structure except for the
i -layer region as shown in Fig.
1 . The samples S1 and S2 were grown with 10 and 20 stacked pairs of an InAs QD layer with 2.0 ML thicknesses and a 20 nm-thick
GaN 0.01 As 0.99
strain-compensation layer (SCL), respectively. The sample S3 comprised of 20 pairs of 2.0 ML InAs QDs and 20 nm-thick GaAs spacer layers, and hence the QD structure was strained. Last, the sample S4 was a GaAs control cell with a 400 nm-thick
i -GaAs layer used as a reference. For electrical characterization, AuZn alloy was used for the front electrode and indium for the back, and a standard anti-reflection coating (ARC) using
MgF 2
was employed in
3 × 3   mm 2
sized SCs.

We measured the symmetric scans around the (004) reflection in a
ω - 2 θ
geometry in high resolution x-ray diffraction (XRD) in order to characterize the effect of strain compensation. Figure

show the XRD spectra for samples S2 and S3. The satellite peaks originating from the periodic superlattice structure can be clearly observed in each sample, and hence abrupt heterointerfaces are maintained. For S2, the zeroth-order satellite peak S(0) indicated by an arrow in the figure shows a near lattice match with GaAs substrate as shown in Fig.
2(a) . Therefore, the net average compressive strain induced by InAs QD layers is approximately compensated by 20 nm-thick
GaN 0.01 As 0.99
SCLs though not precisely balanced out in all three dimensions of QDs. 15

shows the cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) image measured for S2. A vertical alignment of the lens-shaped QDs along the growth direction is maintained from one layer to the next without degrading the structure and size uniformity. Further, we observe no strain-induced defects or dislocations from the image, which would otherwise be generated if the buildup of lattice strain exceeds the critical layer thickness during stacking. 5,10
The mean QD diameter, height, size dispersion in diameter, and in-plane density were 39.1 nm, 5.2 nm, 13.4%, and
3.6 × 10 10 / cm 2 ⁠ , respectively. As a result, the total density of QDs amounts to the order of
10 12 / cm 2 ⁠ , which would be extremely difficult to achieve by the conventional strained S-K growth.

Figures
4 (a) – (d) show the internal quantum efficiencies (IQEs) of QDSCs S1–S4, respectively. The IQE was determined from a direct measurement of the external QE under a constant photon irradiation of
10 16 / cm 2 ⁠ , then discounting for the shadowing loss and residual reflection loss arising from ARC. We also measured the photoluminescence (PL) for each sample at room temperature by using a standard lock-in technique with a cw 532 nm second harmonic generation
Nd : YVO 4
laser as an excitation source and InGaAs photodetector. The PL spectrum obtained for S2 is shown in Fig.
4(e) , which is used to identify the photoabsorption edge for each layer. First, a single PL emission peak from the ground state of InAs QDs is observed at around 1170 nm with a full width at half maximum of 65.4 meV. In addition, a shoulder peak originating from both GaNAs spacer layer and InAs wetting layer is seen at around 980 nm for S1 and S2, and 880 nm for S3, respectively. Second, the absorption edge redshifts from 1150 nm for S3 up to 1200 nm for S2, and this is because the quantum confinement is lower at the conduction band interface when GaNAs is used as the barrier instead of GaAs. 14,16

The filtered short-circuit current density
( I sc )
of sample S2 (strain-compensated, 20 stacks) beyond the GaAs bandedge of
∼ 880   nm ⁠ , which gives the contribution from QD layer, was determined to be
2.47   mA / cm 2
by taking the product of IQE and solar spectrum (AM1.5). This value was twice that of S1 (strain-compensated, 10 stacks) and four times larger than that of S3 (strained, 20 stacks), respectively. Though the obtained value is notably higher than the reported values for QDSCs, 3,10,17
the maximum IQE from the QD layers even for S2 is still limited to
∼ 5 % ⁠ , and thus a larger stack of QD layers is required to obtain higher photoabsorption. Furthermore, the fact that the degradation of QEs in the shorter wavelength is not observed after increasing the QD layer from 10 to 20 stacks suggests that the crystalline quality is maintained in our strain-compensated QDSCs as the contribution to the photocurrent generated by the
p -GaAs emitter is not affected. The dark
I - V
measurements show an improved diode factor of
n = 1.42
for S2 compared to
n = 1.62
for S3 due to the reduction in recombination loss as a result of the strain compensation. 18
To this end,
I sc
improved to
21.1   mA / cm 2
for S2 compared to
19.0   mA / cm 2
for S1 and
19.6   mA / cm 2
for S3, respectively, and
I sc = 19.7   mA / cm 2
for the control cell S4 with 400 nm-thick
i -GaAs layer as a reference. The projected conversion efficiency is 8.5% and 5.7% for strain-compensated S1 and S2 QDSC, respectively.
In summary, we have fabricated and characterized InAs/GaNAs QDSCs fabricated using the strain-compensation technique on GaAs(001) substrates. Compensating for the lattice strain induced by QDs with a spacer layer that produces the opposite strain works well to achieve an improved size uniformity, a redshift of absorption edge, and to avoid generation of defects and dislocations. The total QD density of our QDSC with 20 stacks of InAs QD is on the order of
10 12 / cm 2
and
I sc = 21.1   mA / cm 2 ⁠ . The filtered
I sc
beyond GaAs band edge of
2.47   mA / cm 2
is four times higher than that for a strained QDSC with identical cell structure.

Abstract Metal halide perovskites are of great interest for various high-performance optoelectronic applications 1 . The ability to tune the perovskite bandgap continuously by modifying the chemical composition opens up applications for perovskites as coloured emitters, in building-integrated photovoltaics, and as components of tandem photovoltaics to increase the power conversion efficiency 2 , 3 , 4 . Nevertheless, performance is limited by non-radiative losses, with luminescence yields in state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells still far from 100 per cent under standard solar illumination conditions 5 , 6 , 7 . Furthermore, in mixed halide perovskite systems designed for continuous bandgap tunability 2
(bandgaps of approximately 1.7 to 1.9 electronvolts), photoinduced ion segregation leads to bandgap instabilities 8 , 9 . Here we demonstrate substantial mitigation of both non-radiative losses and photoinduced ion migration in perovskite films and interfaces by decorating the surfaces and grain boundaries with passivating potassium halide layers. We demonstrate external photoluminescence quantum yields of 66 per cent, which translate to internal yields that exceed 95 per cent. The high luminescence yields are achieved while maintaining high mobilities of more than 40 square centimetres per volt per second, providing the elusive combination of both high luminescence and excellent charge transport 10 . When interfaced with electrodes in a solar cell device stack, the external luminescence yield—a quantity that must be maximized to obtain high efficiency—remains as high as 15 per cent, indicating very clean interfaces. We also demonstrate the inhibition of transient photoinduced ion-migration processes across a wide range of mixed halide perovskite bandgaps in materials that exhibit bandgap instabilities when unpassivated. We validate these results in fully operating solar cells. Our work represents an important advance in the construction of tunable metal halide perovskite films and interfaces that can approach the efficiency limits in tandem solar cells, coloured-light-emitting diodes and other optoelectronic applications.

Main We fabricated a series of passivated triple-cation perovskite thin films on glass 11
((Cs 0.06 FA 0.79 MA 0.15 )Pb(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3 , where MA = methylammonium, CH 3 NH 3 +
and FA = formamidinium, CH 3 (NH 2 ) 2 + ), by diluting the precursor solution with potassium iodide solution. We denote the perovskite as (Cs,FA,MA)Pb(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3
and the passivated samples as
x  = [K]/([A] + [K]), where A = (Cs, FA, MA);
x
represents the fraction of potassium ions out of the total monovalent cations in the precursor solution. We note that the standard triple-cation precursor solution recipe ( x  = 0) has a slight halide deficiency; however, the introduction of potassium iodide leads to samples with a slight excess of halide, along with very small changes to the I/Br ratio ( Extended Data Fig. 1 ). The films have uniformly packed grains, each with a size of around 200–400 nm ( Extended Data Fig. 1 ). Absorption and photoluminescence measurements reveal a reduction in the optical bandgap of the perovskite film upon increasing addition of potassium iodide, consistent with the selective interaction of the additives with bromide ( Extended Data Fig. 2 ). For a solar cell or light-emitting diode to approach its efficiency limit, all recombination should be radiative and the luminescence should be maximized 12 . In state-of-the-art perovskite films, there are still substantial non-radiative losses that originate from charge-carrier trap states present in the perovskite layer 13 . The origin of the trap states is unclear, but they may be associated with ionic defects such as halide vacancies 14 , 15 . In
Fig. 1a , we show the external photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of the (Cs,FA,MA)Pb(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3
perovskite films with increasing potassium content measured at excitation densities equivalent to that of solar illumination. The PLQE shows a substantial increase from 8% when
x  = 0 to 41% when
x  = 0.05, reaching a very high PLQE of 66% when
x  = 0.40. By accounting for photon recycling and light-out-coupling effects 16 , these values translate to an internal PLQE that exceeds 95% for the passivated compositions ( Fig. 1a ). Furthermore, the PLQE does not vary considerably with excitation power for the passivated samples, unlike for the
x  = 0 sample in which the PLQE increases with increasing excitation power owing to filling of the trap states 17
( Extended Data Fig. 2 ). These results are also observed in micro-photoluminescence measurements ( Extended Data Fig. 3 ). Time-resolved photoluminescence experiments ( Fig. 1b ) show the removal of the fast non-radiative decay component with passivation, leading to radiative bimolecular recombination ( Extended Data Fig. 4 ).

x  = 0.4, which could be an effect of decreasing grain sizes when
x  > 0.2 (see Methods) 19 . These results are consistent with lower trap densities 13
for the passivated samples, with the elimination of almost all non-radiative channels and the retention of excellent charge transport up to
x  = 0.1. In
Fig. 2a , we show the PLQE from the (Cs,FA,MA)Pb(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3
thin films as a function of time, under continuous illumination with intensity equivalent to 1 sun. For the reference film ( x  = 0), we observed a substantial but slow increase in PLQE with time, associated with photoinduced halide migration 20 . By contrast, the high values of PLQE for the passivated films are stable under continuous illumination, suggesting that the photoinduced migration processes are substantially inhibited. To investigate the latter claim further, we prepared large-bandgap perovskite films by adding potassium iodide to precursor solutions with higher fractions of bromide; when unpassivated, such films typically show substantial photoluminescence shifts due to photoinduced halide segregation and subsequent emission from low-bandgap iodide-rich components 8 . We show that the photoluminescence spectral output of passivated (Cs,FA,MA)Pb(I 0.4 Br 0.6 ) 3
films is very stable at the optimal bandgap for perovskite–silicon tandems 2
(1.75 eV) under 1-sun illumination ( Fig. 2c ). By contrast, the sample without passivation shows substantial redshifts and bandgap changes over time ( Fig. 2b ). In
Fig. 2d , we show that this photostability is also seen across bromide fractions covering the range of idealized wide bandgaps for perovskite–perovskite tandems 2
(1.7–1.9 eV), albeit with slightly reduced stability at the highest bromide fractions ( Extended Data Fig. 4 ). We also found that the critical bandgaps for tandems can be stabilized even at low passivation levels ( x  = 0.1,
Fig. 2d ). To our knowledge, this is the first report that shows such high stability in mixed halide compositions across a wide range of bandgaps under solar illumination in ambient conditions 3 .

Full size image Next, we investigated the chemical composition of the passivated (Cs,FA,MA)Pb(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3
perovskite thin films using scanning transmission electron microscopy–energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM–EDX). In
Fig. 3a , we show a cross-sectional view of a lamella of a film of composition
x  = 0.2. From the STEM–EDX elemental analysis, we observe a potassium-rich phase at the grain boundaries of the perovskite as well as at the interface with the substrate ( Fig. 3c
and
Extended Data Fig. 6 ). Analysis of the dataset using a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm 21
highlights the presence of two compositional phases in the specimen, denoted factor 1 and factor 2 in
Fig. 3b, c . Factor 1 shows characteristic EDX features of the perovskite phase, including Br L α , Pb M α
and I L α
lines ( Fig. 3d ), whereas factor 2 is rich in bromide and potassium ( Fig. 3e ) and, notably, is particularly prominent at the grain boundaries and at the top and bottom surfaces of the perovskite film. This is probably related to a new crystalline phase that is observed in grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) experiments ( Extended Data Fig. 7 ). These results are also consistent with hard-X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES) measurements, which reveal a decrease in potassium upon moving from the film surface into the bulk ( Extended Data Fig. 8 ). Collectively, these results indicate the formation of potassium halide (particularly bromide-rich) passivation layers decorating the surfaces, where the potassium is not incorporated into the perovskite lattice. This is in contrast to previous works 5 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25
that report the addition of small monovalent cations—including sodium, rubidium or potassium—to the perovskite; these studies proposed that the cations were incorporated into the lattice, although a recent report 26
shows that rubidium does not incorporate and suggests the same for potassium. Figure 3: Cross-sectional chemical characterization of a passivated perovskite thin film. a , HAADF STEM cross-sectional image of a (Cs,FA,MA)Pb(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3

Full size image In
Fig. 3f , we summarize our interpretation of the collective results. We used potassium iodide to introduce excess iodide into the perovskite precursor solutions, to compensate for any halide vacancies. The excess halides fill these vacancies, thereby passivating the non-radiative recombination pathways and leading to high luminescence efficiencies. The excess halides are immobilized in the form of benign, potassium-rich, halide-sequestering species at the grain boundaries and surfaces, thereby inhibiting halide migration and suppressing any additional non-radiative decay arising from interstitial halides. At potassium contents greater than
x  = 0.1, these non-perovskite species perturb charge transport because of their large size ( Extended Data Fig. 6 ). This suggests that there is an optimal potassium content of approximately 0.1, which is a compromise between high radiative efficiency and the retention of high charge-carrier mobility. Finally, we propose that potassium selectively depletes bromide from the perovskite crystal structure; this is consistent with the increased lattice parameter, redshifting band-edge, and decreasing Br/I ratio in the bulk observed upon the addition of potassium ( Extended Data Figs 2
and
8 ). These observations and such substantially enhanced properties are not found in the absence of bromide ( Extended Data Fig. 2 ). The addition of small fractions of bromide to the perovskite precursor solutions has been shown to improve perovskite film formation 27 . However, bromide-rich perovskites typically have increased trap states and inferior charge-carrier mobility compared to their iodide-based counterparts 28 . Here we exploit the beneficial properties of bromide in the grain-formation process, while suppressing the formation of bromide-induced defect states in the bulk of the crystal. At open circuit in a solar cell, external luminescence should be maximized 12 , and any additional non-radiative losses that occur upon the introduction of device electrodes must be minimized. In
Fig. 4a, d , we show the time-resolved photoluminescence decays and PLQE, respectively, for the (Cs,FA,MA)Pb(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3
perovskite with and without potassium passivation when deposited on a standard n-type mesoporous TiO 2
electron-accepting contact (see
Extended Data Fig. 9
for other excitation intensities). We found that charge-carrier recombination in the presence of the electrode is slower and more radiative (higher integrated time-resolved photoluminescence intensity) in the presence of potassium, with the PLQE decreasing by a factor of only 1.7 (to 27.1%), compared to a factor of 6.7 (to 3.0%) without passivation. In
Fig. 4b , we show the time-resolved photoluminescence decays for a perovskite containing a top layer based on a standard p-type hole-accepting contact spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis( N , N -di- p -methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene). We again find that passivation leads to slower charge-carrier recombination and a less notable reduction in PLQE upon introduction of the electrode ( Fig. 4d)—a
decrease by a factor of 4.5 (to 10.4%) with passivation, compared to a decrease by a factor of 38 (to 0.5%) without. In
Fig. 4c , time-resolved photoluminescence decays for the full device stack (that is, both electrodes) clearly demonstrate that recombination is slower and the decrease in PLQE is mitigated upon passivation with potassium. The external PLQE of the full stack is 14.5% with the passivating interlayers (a reduction by a factor of 3.2 upon addition of the electrodes), which is an order of magnitude higher than the value of 1.2% for the control stack (reduction by a factor of 17). These results show that the potassium interlayers not only improve the optoelectronic properties of the perovskite material alone, but also lead to vastly improved interfaces with device electrodes.

Fig. 5a , we show the forward and reverse current–voltage ( J – V ) curves of the best-performing devices containing the (Cs,FA,MA)Pb(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3

Table 1
(see
Extended Data Figs 10

curves and device statistics). We found that the device power conversion efficiency (PCE) increases from 17.3% ( x  = 0) to 21.5% ( x  = 0.1) upon passivation, with the elimination of hysteresis in the latter case consistent with inhibition of ion migration 1 , 20 . This is also consistent with a rapid increase in stabilized power efficiency to a value of 21.3%, compared to a slower increase to just 17.2% for the control ( Fig. 5a , inset). We observed an increase in open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) upon passivation, from 1.05 V ( x  = 0) to 1.17 V ( x  = 0.1) ( Fig. 5b ); the calculated difference in
V OC
(obtained from the increase in PLQE of the device stacks from 1.2% to 14.5%,
Fig. 4d ) matches within the error of the device statistics. The loss of open-circuit voltage from the radiative limit is only 0.11 V, and is one of the lowest losses reported in a perovskite solar cell so far 5 . We also see an increase in the short-circuit current density ( J SC ) upon potassium addition up to a value of
x  = 0.1 ( Fig. 5c ), consistent with the increased carrier mobility and lifetime 29 . The optimal device performance at
x  = 0.1 therefore validates the compromise between radiative efficiency and carrier mobility. We conducted preliminary stability tests and found a negligible drop in shelf-life performance over a month, and the devices retained over 80% of their initial performance after 300 h of continuous operation at maximum power ( Extended Data Fig. 10 ). We show device results for larger-bandgap (Cs,FA,MA)Pb(I 0.4 Br 0.6 ) 3
absorbers ( Fig. 5d, f ), attaining a PCE of 17.9% with minimal hysteresis for the
x  = 0.1 composition and stabilized power output of 17.1% (see
Table 1
and
Extended Data Fig. 11
for device statistics). This is one of the highest device efficiencies yet reported for a large-bandgap (1.78 eV) perovskite that is ideally suited for tandem applications 3 . Figure 5: Enhanced solar-cell power conversion efficiency. a , Forward (open symbols) and reverse (closed symbols)

Full size image Table 1 Parameters of the best-performing photovoltaic devices Full size table These results are particularly notable for two reasons. First, the perovskite films and interfaces are surprisingly tolerant to passivating additives. Here, we have introduced additives at sufficiently high loading levels to passivate surfaces and stabilize luminescence across a range of bandgaps without compromising charge transport or extraction. This tolerance is in contrast to that of conventional semiconductors such as GaAs, which require more complicated passivation approaches such as controlled growth on lattice-matched substrates 30 . Second, these results show directly the importance of obtaining high, stable external luminescence yields in full device stacks that contain luminescent absorbers capable of recycling photons 12 , 31 . The internal luminescence yields approaching 100%, along with the small loss in external luminescence yield in the full device stack, shows that perovskites can sustain the necessary photon gas to achieve voltage losses low enough to rival those of GaAs. We note that the perovskite compositions and passivating interlayers used in this work lead to materials with far greater luminescence and broader stability enhancements compared with those containing rubidium or potassium that have been reported previously 5 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 . Further investigation into potassium-based passivation will be required, including its efficacy in different perovskite compositions, deposition methods and contacts, and how it could be ultimately exploited (or even mimicked, using other halide-sequestering species) to eliminate interfacial non-radiative losses and ionic migration. The combination of high radiative efficiency, excellent charge transport and photostable bandgaps makes these passivation approaches extremely promising in taking perovskite devices to their efficiency limits across a range of bandgaps. Methods Film and device fabrication All the organic cation salts were purchased form Dyesol, the lead compounds were from TCI, and caesium iodide and potassium iodide were obtained from Alfa Aesar. spiro-OMeTAD was purchased from Borun Chemicals and was used as received. Unless otherwise stated, all other materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The triple-cation-based perovskite Cs 0.06 FA 0.79 MA 0.15 Pb(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3
was prepared by dissolving PbI 2
(1.2 M), formamidinium iodide (1.11 M), methylammonium bromide (0.21 M) and PbBr 2
(0.21 M) in a mixture of anhydrous DMF:DMSO (4:1 volume ratio, v:v) followed by addition of 5 vol% from CsI stock solution (1.5 M in DMSO). The potassium iodide was first dissolved in a mixed solution of DMF:DMSO 4:1 (v:v) to make a stock solution of 1.5 M. We then added the potassium iodide solution into the triple cation perovskite solution in different volume ratios. We spin-coated the perovskite solutions using a two-step program at 2,000 and 6,000 rpm for 10 and 30 s, respectively, adding a 150 μl drop of chlorobenzene 30 s after the start of the spinning routine. We then annealed the films at 100 °C for 1 h. All the film preparations were performed in a nitrogen-filled glove box. The devices were fabricated following the same procedures for substrate preparation as well as deposition of both electron and hole transport layers (that is, TiO 2 , spiro-OMeTAD) as in ref.
32 . Scanning electron microscopy The surface morphology of the films was examined using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (Merlin). An electron beam accelerated to 3 kV was used with an in-lens detector. Steady-state absorption and photoluminescence characterization Absorption spectra were recorded with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 1050 spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere to account for reflected and transmitted light. Photothermal deflection spectroscopy measurements were acquired on a custom-built set-up by monitoring the deflection of a fixed wavelength (670 nm) laser probe beam after absorption of each monochromatic pump wavelength by a thin film immersed in an inert liquid FC-72 Fluorinert (3M). Photoluminescence quantum yield measurements were taken by mounting perovskite films or encapsulated device stacks in an integrating sphere and photoexciting with a 532-nm continuous-wave laser. The laser and the emission signals were measured and quantified using a calibrated Andor iDus DU490A InGaAs detector for the determination of photoluminescence quantum efficiency. The external PLQE was calculated as per ref.
33
and the internal PLQE was subsequently determined using the methods described in ref.
16 . The absorption and photoluminescence ( Extended Data Fig. 2a, b ) spectra reveal a reduction in the optical bandgap of the perovskite film upon the addition of increasing amounts of potassium iodide. The photoluminescence peaks at 770 nm for
x  = 0 and redshifts to 807 nm for
x  = 0.4. From HAXPES measurements, we find that increasing amounts of potassium iodide have no effect on the valence band edge, which suggests that it is the conduction band energy level that must become deeper ( Extended Data Fig. 2b , inset). We note that this is in contrast to the case of the bandgap tunability achieved by directly changing mixed halide fractions, in which the valence band was shown to change but the conduction band remained almost fixed 34 . Measurements on similar perovskite systems without bromide did not show such a strong redshift upon the addition of potassium ( Extended Data Fig. 2f–i ), which suggests that the additives are selectively interacting with the bromide. These results highlight the combination of potassium additives and mixed halides as levers for selectively tuning the bandgap and conduction band. We also note that the samples show a small fraction of material (less than 1%) with a low-bandgap component ( Extended Data Fig. 2c ), but the emission is predominantly from the slightly higher energy component. It is currently unclear why the luminescence is not dominated by the low-gap component, but it is possible that these low-concentration, low-bandgap components are electronically isolated from the remaining material, for example being surrounded by potassium-rich passivating material. We also note that the decrease in PLQE for
x  = 0.6 could be due to the much smaller grain size at these high passivation levels ( Extended Data Fig. 1 ). Finally, we note that changes in absorptance due to thickness changes upon potassium iodide addition are negligible over the ranges for our devices ( x  = 0–0.2), and therefore are not a major cause of the observed enhancements in device performance. Confocal photoluminescence maps Photoluminescence maps were collected using a WITec alpha 300 s setup. The excitation source was a 405-nm continuous-wave laser (Coherent CUBE), chopped using a Stanford Research SR 540 chopping unit at frequency of 840 Hz. The light was coupled through an optical fibre to the microscope and focused using a 100× Nikon lens (numerical aperture = 0.7). The sample was positioned on an X–Y piezo stage of the microscope. The photoluminescence signal was collected in reflection mode with the same 100× objective and detected using a spectrometer fitted with a CCD (charge-coupled device) detector. A low-pass filter with a cut-off wavelength of 435 nm was fitted before the CCD detector to block the excitation component of transmitted light (405 nm). The confocal photoluminescence intensity maps are shown in
Extended Data Fig. 3a–d
from perovskite films with
x  = 0–0.4, with the intensity distributions shown in
Extended Data Fig. 3i . For example, we observe a broad distribution of emission intensity peaking at 2 × 10 4
counts for
x  = 0.20 compared to a narrower distribution but with a maximum at only 5 × 10 3
counts for the reference film ( x  = 0). Although the intensity distribution is broader for the
x  = 0.2 sample, the lowest counts for this sample are as high in number as the highest counts for the reference. We find that the absolute emission intensity increases continuously with increasing content of potassium ( Extended Data Fig. 3i ), peaking at
x  = 0.40 with an order of magnitude enhancement compared with the reference, consistent with the PLQE data in
Fig. 1a . We also show the centre-of-mass photoluminescence wavelength maps for the same perovskite films in
Extended Data Fig. 3e–h , along with the corresponding histograms in
Extended Data Fig. 3j . This further confirms the redshifting of the microscale photoluminescence upon addition of potassium, consistent with the absorption and bulk photoluminescence data. Notably, we find a statistically significant correlation between the photoluminescence wavelength and the intensity for each local site (that is, the most emissive sites are the most redshifted, see
Extended Data Fig. 3k ). This is consistent with the bulk absorption and photoluminescence data, in which the photoluminescence intensity increases and redshifts with increasing potassium content. Time-resolved photoluminescence Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements were acquired with a gated intensified CCD camera system (Andor iStar DH740 CCI-010) connected to a grating spectrometer (Andor SR303i). Excitation was performed with femtosecond laser pulses which were generated in a homebuilt set-up by second harmonic generation in a β-barium borate crystal from the fundamental output (pulse energy 1.55 eV, pulse length 80 fs) of a Ti:sapphire laser system (Spectra-Physics Solstice). Temporal resolution of the photoluminescence emission was obtained by measuring the photoluminescence from the sample by stepping the intensified CCD gate delay relative to the pump pulse. The gate width was 20 ns. For the unpassivated control film ( x  = 0), there is a considerable initial non-radiative component ( Fig. 1b ). With increasing passivation, this component is gradually removed with a peak ‘lifetime’ occurring at
x  = 0.1. In this regime, the recombination is still trap-limited for this excitation density (that is, the carrier density does not exceed the trap density to fill all traps). As the passivation increases, the trap density is further reduced, until the density of excited carriers is greater than the trap density and recombination is radiative and bimolecular. In this regime, the recombination follows a power law and the lifetime is ‘faster’ with decreasing trap density (increasing passivation, that is,
x  = 0.2–0.4). We note that the total area under the non-normalized curves in each case matches the increasing PLQE trend. Time-resolved microwave conductivity measurements The TRMC technique monitors the change in microwave power reflected by the loaded microwave cavity upon pulsed laser excitation. The photoconductance (Δ G ) of the perovskite films was deduced from the collected laser-induced change in normalized microwave power Δ P ( t )/ P  = − K Δ G ( t ), where
K
is the sensitivity factor. The product of the yield of generated free charges
ϕ
and mobility Σ μ  = ( μ e
+
μ h ) were obtained by:
ϕ Σ μ  = Δ G /( I 0 βeF A ), where
I 0
is the number of photons per pulse per unit area,
β
is a geometry constant of the microwave cell,
e
is the elementary charge and
F A
is the fraction of light absorbed by the sample at the excitation wavelength of 600 nm. In
Extended Data Fig. 5 , we show the Δ G
as a function of time after pulsed excitation at 600 nm for different fractions of potassium acquired at different fluences. The TRMC signal depicts a rapid increase, originating from the formation of mobile charges, followed by a decay attributed to charge recombination or immobilization of charge carriers by traps. In
Fig. 1c , we show that at least up to
x  = 0.1, the charge transport remains unperturbed with the addition of potassium. That is, in view of the low electric field strength of the microwaves (100 V cm −1 ), the charges are not effectively displaced by this field but instead they are perturbed in their diffusional motion. As a result, the distance
R
crossed by the charges is limited by the charge-carrier diffusion coefficient and half the oscillation period
ν
(8.5 GHz), which amounts to: As shown in
Extended Data Fig. 1 , the grain sizes are approximately 200–400 nm and are independent of the potassium concentration for values up to
x  = 0.1. Therefore, for
x  < 0.1, the grains are larger than the probing length (80 nm) of the measurement and the TRMC mobility as probed will not be affected by the grain size. However, smaller grain sizes are observed for
x  > 0.2, which is most likely the reason for the lower mobilities at higher values of
x
(ref.
19 ). Furthermore, we show the resulting half-lives
τ 1/2
(time taken to decay to half of the initial value) for the different samples in
Extended Data Fig. 5f
across a range of excitation fluences. At low fluence, one of the carriers is trapped, leading to a long-lived signal from the untrapped carrier, which recombines following monomolecular kinetics 13 , 35 . At higher fluences in which the traps are filled, the recombination is bimolecular. We find that charge-carrier recombination is substantially slower for the
x  = 0.1 composition compared to the
x  = 0 reference, with the low-fluence monomolecular lifetime increasing from 1 μs ( x  = 0) to 1.5 μs ( x  = 0.1). Scanning transmission electron microscopy–energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy A FEI Helios Nanolab dual beam focus ion beam/field emission gun-scanning electron microscope (FIB/FEGSEM) was used to prepare a lamella for STEM imaging and analysis. To preserve the perovskite film during specimen preparation, capping layers of spiro-OMeTAD and platinum were deposited. All imaging was carried out in STEM-HAADF (high-angle annular dark field) mode. STEM–EDX data were acquired in an FEI Tecnai Osiris TEM equipped with a high-brightness Schottky X-FEG gun and a Super-X EDX system composed of four silicon drift detectors, each approximately 30 mm 2
in area and placed symmetrically around the optic axis to achieve a collection solid angle of 0.9 sr. Spectrum images were acquired with a probe current of 0.7 nA, an acceleration voltage of 200 kV, a spatial sampling of 10 nm per pixel and a dwell time of 100 ms per pixel. Data were acquired with a Tecnai Imaging and Analysis system and analysed with Hyperspy. In
Extended Data Fig. 6b–e , we report a cross-section STEM–EDX measurement for a control perovskite thin film (that is,
x  = 0). We treated the EDX dataset with the NMF algorithm, which led to the identification of two main components in the thin film. Factor 1 is representative of the perovskite layer, whereas factor 2 can be associated with a bromide- and lead-rich phase. This second component shows higher intensity at the interfaces with the spiro-OMeTAD protective capping layer and with the silicon substrate. In contrast to the case of the passivated perovskite film ( x  = 0.20,
Fig. 3 ), we do not observe the presence of surface decoration at the grain boundaries. X-ray diffraction X-ray diffraction was performed using a Bruker X-ray D8 Advance diffractometer with Cu Kα 1,2
radiation ( λ  = 1.541 Å). Spectra were collected with an angular range of 5° < 2 θ  < 60° and Δ θ  = 0.01227° over 10 min. Measurements were made on as-prepared films. A Le Bail analysis was carried out on film measurements using the Bruker Topas software. Chebyshev polynomials were used to fit the background and the peak shape modelled with a pseudo-Voigt function. Grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering GIWAXS measurements were performed on the XMaS facility at the ESRF synchrotron. A fixed-exit, water-cooled, double crystal Si(111) monochromator, placed 25 m from the source, was used to monochromatize the X-ray beam coming from a bending magnet ( E c  = 9.8 keV). The X-ray energy was tuned to 10 keV (1.2398 Å) and a Rh-coated toroidal mirror was used to focus the monochromatic beam horizontally and vertically. The beam flux was approximately 5 × 10 10
photons per second at the sample position. The original beam spot size was 500 (horizontal) × 400 (vertical) μm 2
at the sample position. We used a set of motorized slits (Huber) immediately before the sample to have a better-defined footprint in the vertical direction. The final beam spot size with slits was 300 (horizontal) × 115 (vertical) μm 2 . The beam footprint extended 300 μm horizontally and throughout the perovskite films. The samples were scanned at an out-of-plane incident angle of around 0.3°. As shown in
Extended Data Fig. 7a, d
( x  = 0 and
x  = 0.2, respectively), the GIWAXS diffraction patterns collected at an incident angle of 0.3° show the main perovskite diffraction ring at
q  = 1 Å −1 . A PbI 2
peak can be detected at
q  = 0.9 Å −1
for the reference film, which probably originates from a small fraction of excess lead iodide in the reference precursor solution. In
Extended Data Fig. 7f, g , we plot the line profiles, azimuthally integrated over the entire image for perovskite films with
x  = 0–0.4. The PbI 2
peak diminishes with higher potassium content and disappears at
x  = 0.2. Furthermore, we observe a new diffraction peak at
q  = 0.7 Å −1
that appears when
x  ≥ 0.10 and can be assigned to a non-perovskite potassium-rich crystalline phase which grows with increasing potassium. We also observe the growth of new peaks with increasing potassium content in laboratory X-ray diffraction results (highlighted by asterisks in
Extended Data Fig. 2d ). Currently, we cannot unambiguously assign these peaks—for example to potassium bromide or potassium iodide—which points to this phase (or phases) having more complicated chemical compositions (such as KBr x I 1− x , K 2 PbI 4
or K 2 PbBr 4 24 ) and crystallinities. However, given the observations in the STEM–EDX experiments ( Fig. 3 ), we expect that at least one of the phases present is rich in potassium and bromide and is likely to be the halide-sequestering species proposed in our model. Identification of the precise composition of these sequestering species should be the subject of future work in this area. Soft and hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy Photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were performed at the Diamond Light Source using the beamline I09 (Oxfordshire, UK). Both soft (758 eV) and hard (2,200 and 6,600 eV) X-rays were used to illuminate our sample, to provide information from different probing depths. The soft X-ray energy was selected through a plane grating monochromator, whereas a double-crystal monochromator was used in the hard X-ray section. The values of 2,200 and 6,600 eV correspond to the first- and third-order light when the double-crystal monochromator is set at 2,200 eV using a Si(111) crystal. A EW4000 photoelectron analyser (VG Scienta) was used to record the spectra with an analyser slit open to 0.2 mm. No charge neutralization was used and the binding energy scale was calibrated by setting the Au 4 f
core level of a gold reference sample to 84.0 eV. The quantification tables and intensity ratios were calculated from the experimental results after correction using the photoionization cross-sections for each element at their specific photon energies, according to database values. The overview spectra of the perovskite thin films shows all the core-level peaks corresponding to the elements forming the perovskite material, including Cs. The high-resolution spectra of the core-level peaks further confirm the quality of the perovskite films, as there is only a single Pb 5 d
component without any metallic lead feature 36
( Extended Data Fig. 8 ). In
Extended Data Fig. 8 , we summarize a quantitative analysis of the potassium content in perovskite films with
x  = 0–0.2 at different photon energies of 758, 2,200 and 6,600 eV, which corresponds to moving from probing the surface (around 2–4 nm) to probing further into the bulk (around 20 nm). We observed that the concentration of potassium decreases when moving from the surface into the bulk for each of the potassium compositions. Notably, we found that the caesium content increases when moving into the bulk, concomitant with the decrease in potassium, suggesting that the potassium pushes the caesium further into the bulk ( Extended Data Fig. 8d ). Furthermore, the I/Pb ratio increases at higher potassium content ( Extended Data Fig. 8e ), particularly at the surface, consistent with the addition of excess I from the potassium iodide source and in agreement with a previous report showing a higher concentration of iodide at the surface 36 . Finally, the Br/I ratio decreases at higher potassium content, particularly deeper in the film (probed with the higher photon energies), consistent with potassium more selectively drawing out the bromide from the lattice ( Extended Data Fig. 8f ). These results suggest that potassium is predominantly located at the surfaces, and the addition of potassium iodide also leads to excess halides on the surfaces with a more selective interaction with bromides. Solar-cell characterization Current–voltage characteristics were recorded by applying an external potential bias to the cell while recording the generated photocurrent with a digital source meter (Keithley Model 2400). The light source was a 450-W xenon lamp (Oriel) equipped with a Schott-K113 Tempax sunlight filter (Präzisions Glas & OptikGmbH) to match the emission spectrum of the lamp to the AM1.5G standard. Before each measurement, the exact light intensity was determined using a calibrated silicon reference diode equipped with an infrared cut-off filter (KG-3, Schott). External quantum efficiency spectra were recorded as a function of wavelength under a constant white-light bias of approximately 5 mW cm −2
supplied by an array of white light-emitting diodes. The excitation beam coming from a 300 W xenon lamp (ILC Technology) was focused through a Gemini-180 double monochromator (Jobin Yvon Ltd) and chopped at approximately 2 Hz. The signal was recorded using a Model SR830 DSP lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research Systems). All measurements were conducted using a non-reflective metal aperture of 0.105 cm 2
to define the active area of the device and avoid light scattering through the sides. For stability measurements, the solar cells were transferred to a sealable device holder under nitrogen glove-box conditions. During testing the device holder was continuously purged with dry nitrogen, which had been pre-filtered (SGT Super Clean) to minimize residual oxygen, moisture and hydrocarbon content. A Newport solar simulator with equivalent AM 1.5 G 1-sun output was used to illuminate the entire device substrate; short wavelengths were filtered using a 435 nm long-pass filter (Thor Labs FGL435). Ageing under these conditions resulted in an ambient temperature inside the chamber of approximately 40 °C, which was measured by a thermistor next to the solar-cell device and was reached within 30 min of the experiment commencing. Photocurrent characteristics were recorded close to the maximum power point voltage (as ascertained from an initial
J – V
curve) using a Keithley 2636 SMU and a custom-written LabView VI code. Devices were stored in a nitrogen-filled glove box in the dark between shelf-life measurements.

Editorial Summary Potassium passivation improves perovskite luminescence Metal halide perovskites have excellent optoelectronic properties and are cheap and easy to manufacture, making them potential rivals for leading optoelectronic technologies. Solar cells are one promising direction, with efficiencies greater than 20% already achieved within just a few years. Despite this, luminescence yields in state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells are still far below 100%, so there is room for improvement. Samuel Stranks and colleagues decorate the surfaces and grain boundaries of perovksites with passivating potassium halide layers. This reduced parasitic non-radiative losses and photo-induced ion migration—two key causes of low luminescence yields. They applied this approach to a wide range of mixed halide perovskites, which not only yielded luminescence approaching the efficiency limits, but also improved the charge transport and interfaces with device electrodes. show all

Abstract
The material properties of a gel are determined by the underpinning network that immobilises the solvent. When gels are formed by the self-assembly of small molecules into a so-called low molecular weight gel, the network is the result of the molecules forming one-dimensional objects such as fibres or nanotubes which entangle or otherwise cross-link to form a three-dimensional network. Characterising the one-dimensional objects and the network is difficult. Many conventional techniques rely on drying to probe the network, which often leads to artefacts. An effective tool to probe the gel in the solvated state is small angle scattering. Both small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and small angle neutron scattering (SANS) can be used. Here, we discuss these approaches and provide a tutorial review to describe how these approaches work, what opportunities there are and how the data treatment should be approached. We aim to show the power of this approach and provide enabling information to make them accessible to the non-specialist.

Abstract Halide perovskites have attracted tremendous attention from many researchers recently, particularly for their excellent optoelectronic properties in applications such as photovoltaic solar cells and light-emitting diodes. In recent years, the application of halide perovskites has rapidly extended into nanoelectronics, such as thermoelectric, memory, and artificial synapse applications. Halide perovskites can be synthesized easily, even at relatively low temperatures, and organic and inorganic ions can even coexist in one crystal structure. Moreover, the structural flexibility is excellent, where two- and three-dimensional crystals can be linked together. The combination of various types of halide ions not only controls the physical properties of the halide perovskite, but also facilitates control of the bandgap by varying the size of nanoparticles when they exhibit quantum effects. Halide perovskites thus provide an excellent platform for optoelectronics with interesting optical, electrical, and magnetic properties. The articles in this issue introduce the wide range of basic properties and potential applications of halide perovskites.

Introduction The name “perovskite” honors Russian mineralogist L.A. Perovski, who first characterized the structure of the mineral calcium titanium oxide (CaTiO 3 ). A perovskite material has the chemical formula of ABX 3 , where A is a cation with a large ionic radius, B is a metal cation, and X is an anion; its crystallographic structure is the same as that of CaTiO 3 . The easiest way to describe the perovskite structure is to display it as an AX 12
cuboctahedron that shares its edges with a BX 6
octahedron, as shown in Figure

This oxide perovskite structure is energetically stable and is flexible enough to structurally accommodate a variety of elements, which facilitates adjustment and choice of materials to achieve the desired properties. Through successful application as dielectric and piezoelectric materials, the excellent structural properties that are achieved can be used in almost any application, such as superconductors, multiferroics, batteries, fuel cells, photovoltaic electrodes, catalysts, resistive switches, and sensing materials. 2 – 4

Halide perovskites have the same perovskite structure as oxide perovskites, but monovalent halide ions occupy the sites populated by divalent oxygen ions in an oxide perovskite. Therefore, halide perovskites can only host inorganic metal cations, such as Pb 2+ , Sn 2+ , and Ge 2+ , with a valence state of 2 +
to satisfy charge neutrality. This means that diversity in terms of composition can be greatly limited compared to that of oxide perovskites which can also accept trivalent and tetravalent cations at the B site. This limitation, however, is compensated by the possibility of lower-temperature synthesis of halide perovskites compared to oxide perovskites. This allows organic cations to be accommodated in the halide perovskite and has led to the development of a new class of materials called inorganic–organic hybrid halide perovskites. Inorganic–organic hybrid perovskites are well known for their success in solar power generation. In 1978, Weber 5
had already studied the basic crystallographic properties. The acceptance of organic cations in the A position of the perovskite structure could yield new properties that conventional oxide perovskites do not have, which presents a new avenue in materials science. Moreover, organic cations allow easy conversion of a three-dimensional (3D) perovskite to a two-dimensional (2D) structure depending on the size of the ions, and new categories of material groups are expected to be created because a combination of 3D and 2D structures is possible. For example, higher dielectric and piezoelectric properties than those of oxide perovskites BaTiO 3
or Pb(Zr,Ti) O 3
were observed in the 2D perovskite ferroelectric (4-amino tetrahydropyran) 2 PbBr 4 . 6
As shown in Figure
1 , applications using halide perovskites continue to expand to optoelectronic devices, such as solar cells and light-emitting diodes (LEDs); nanoelectronic devices such as thermoelectric and memory devices; and artificial synapses. 7 – 9 Inorganic–organic hybrid perovskite materials such as methylammonium lead triiodide, formamidinium lead triiodide, and formamidinium tin triiodide are especially attracting increasing attention owing to their unique and interesting optical and electrical properties, such as high molar extinction coefficient, tunable bandgap, and low excitation binding energy, and are thus becoming popular targets for exploring new properties. A high power-conversion efficiency, defined as the ratio of energy output from the solar cell to input energy from the sun, of up to 25.2% has been certified for perovskite photovoltaic solar cells, 10
but this is still much lower than the theoretical Shockley–Queisser (S–Q) efficiency (>30%), which is the maximum efficiency for any type of single junction solar cell. To further increase the efficiency of the halide perovskite solar cells, it is necessary to not only reduce trapassisted nonradioactive (also known as Shockley–Read–Hall) recombination, but also to minimize the concentration of defects at each interface composed of a multilayer thin film, and increase light absorption via optical management. Halide perovskite-based LEDs have also achieved an amazing breakthrough in a short time. The articles in this issue provide an overview of each topic that is important to halogen perovskites and devices for optoelectronic applications. Properties and applications of halide perovskites One of the common characteristics of halide perovskites is the presence of n s 2
ions, which is an important factor in understanding the electronic, dielectric, and defect properties of halide materials. In a lead halide perovskite structure containing 6 s 2
cations, the
s
state of the cation decreases in energy and moves away from the
p
state of the cation, establishing a lone-pair state. Significant hybridization between the occupied cation
s
and halogen
p
states (for example, overlap between Pb-6 s
and I-6 p ) endows exceptional performance to lead-based halide perovskites. The Fabini et al. article 11
in this issue introduces the 6 s 2
(5 s 2 ) lone pair electrons on Pb (Sn) and the stereochemistry thereof. The lone pairs are shown to have a decisive impact on the electronic properties, directly yielding a favorable broad valence band and light-hole states. They establish a connection between the electronic composition of the metal cation and the resulting electron-band structure and lattice dynamics of the compound. Perovskite solar cells, which have experienced unprecedented recent efficiency gains, will significantly reduce the rate of increase in efficiency in the near future. Beyond the S–Q efficiency limit for single-junction solar cells, maximum output power can be achieved if photon recycling effects occur in the device. Specifically, there may be an optical management approach to improve the efficiency of perovskite solar cells, including the integration of plasmonic or dielectric nanostructures into the optical cavity design inside the device and its other layers. During the radiative recombination process, photons are generated by recombination of one electron–hole pair, but photons can be reabsorbed at different spatial locations in the solar cell, creating new electron–hole pairs. Designs of light capture and angular restriction can maximize solar cell efficiency by improving the photon reabsorption process. In their article in the issue, Lee et al. 12
review three major technologies for implementing photon recycling for the next phase of approaching the S–Q limit level of halide perovskite solar cells. Halide perovskites have soft, polarizable, and dynamically disordered lattices because the ionic bond between the monovalent halide anion and divalent cation is not strong; thus, point defects form easily. These defects can critically affect the properties and operational stability of metal-halide-perovskite optoelectronic devices. For example, nonradioactive recombination caused by defects in the perovskite solar cells can be a major loss mechanism. The defects also cause significant luminescence quenching in perovskite-based LEDs. Therefore, to achieve high efficiency in both solar cells and LEDs with halide perovskites, it is necessary to create a defect-free, high-quality crystalline phase or, alternatively, to develop a deep understanding of the behavior of the defects. In their article in the issue, Kumar et al. 13
introduce the fundamentals, the unusual behavior, and the properties of defects in halide perovskites. They ask, “Can we find and identify ways to prove the presence or absence of defect tolerance?” Xiao et al. 14
in their article in this issue discuss the post-treatment methods of achieving higher performance in perovskite photovoltaics. It is noteworthy that the development of new fabrication techniques and composition engineering has greatly contributed to improving the device efficiency and performance. This article overviews post-treatment methods and their impact, and summarizes the fundamentals of nonradiative energy loss in perovskite solar cells at the current level of understanding. It also reviews recent advances in mitigating the energy loss by post-treatment techniques and provides key ideas for further development. Apart from the realization of improved efficiencies, these perovskite materials still face stability issues hindering their progress toward commercialization. In their article in this issue, Zhang et al. 15
provide a comprehensive overview and seek solutions through hole-conductor-free perovskite solar cells. Although organic hole-transport materials, such as Spiro-OMeTAD, employed in the fabrication of solar cells yield higher efficiency, they impose a drawback of poor stability. This can be potentially addressed by excluding the hole-transport layers, which transport or extract the hole carriers generated in perovskite active layer under solar irradiation, to take advantage of the superior hole- and electron-transport properties of the perovskite itself. This strategy is presented in detail to enlighten readers, and their prospective application is discussed to pique interest among researchers. The device structure, electron-transport materials, morphology and composition of halide perovskites, electrode materials, and energy-level alignment affect the efficiency of hole-conductor-free perovskite solar cells. The strategies currently applied to optimize the efficiency of various hole-conductor-free perovskite solar cells are presented and their impact on stability and efficiency are discussed. Various device structures of hole-conductor-free perovskite solar cells are presented, and their significant stability and improved efficiency are summarized. Finally, a hint of the future scope and development trend of hole-conductor-free perovskite solar cells is provided to address their low-efficiency issue. The advantage of tunable and narrow emissions covering the whole visible region in nanocrystalline metal-halide perovskites has invoked much interest among researchers. Perovskite nanocrystals have emerged as a new generation of light-emitting materials and have found interesting applications in optically pumped white-emissive LEDs and monochromatic electrically driven LEDs. Although the use of perovskite nanocrystals as active materials for various optoelectronic devices has been explored extensively, they face limitations for light-emitting applications arising from their low photoluminescence quantum efficiencies (PLQEs). This is because of the presence of mobile ionic defects and the small exciton-binding energy. A promising approach to improve the PLQEs is to develop techniques to prepare nanocrystals with increased exciton binding energy and reduced defects. A wide range of reports have been available since 2004 concerning this objective. Because a variety of synthetic approaches have been established to precisely control the compositions and microstructures of perovskite nanocrystals, it is important to consider such milestones in the field of materials development and device integration based on perovskite nanocrystals. In their article in this issue, Xu et al. 16
summarize these recent advances in light-emitting nanocrystalline perovskites, from synthesis control to device integration. Despite tremendous development, many issues and challenges, including stability, lead poisoning, and accessible processing, remain. These are discussed to enlighten readers about the existing challenges and generate innovative ideas among young researchers to overcome them in the near future. Outlook Over the past decade, the performance of optoelectronic devices, such as solar cells and LEDs, based on halide perovskites, has evolved significantly in terms of efficiency and stability. In particular, halide perovskites can now be fabricated as high-efficiency devices using a low-temperature solution process. If long-term stability can be improved, the halide perovskite will become an appealing material that satisfies even low-cost requirements. Moreover, because halide perovskites can accept and incorporate organic cations within one crystal structure, new physical properties may appear depending on the type of organic cations used. Therefore, these materials are expected to be highly scalable for a variety of applications. This will require extensive research, from the basic properties to practical devices. We have briefly reviewed and highlighted various aspects of halide perovskite materials here. We hope the articles in this issue will inspire researchers to utilize these materials in a broad range of research fields, and encourage new and especially early career researchers to enter the field and contribute.

Abstract
The structural and optoelectronic properties of mixed halide perovskite colloidal precursor dispersions are investigated. With increasing concentration, we observe four stages of growing structures, which affect the thin film morphology: (I) nanoparticles, (II) increasing size of nanoparticles, (III) formation of large aggregates/complex clusters and (IV) fragmentation of large aggregates.

Abstract Reduced-dimensional (quasi-2D) perovskite materials are widely applied for perovskite photovoltaics due to their remarkable environmental stability. However, their device performance still lags far behind traditional three dimensional perovskites, particularly high open circuit voltage ( V oc ) loss. Here, inhomogeneous energy landscape is pointed out to be the sole reason, which introduces extra energy loss, creates band tail states and inhibits minority carrier transport. We thus propose to form homogeneous energy landscape to overcome the problem. A synergistic approach is conceived, by taking advantage of material structure and crystallization kinetic engineering. Accordingly, with the help of density functional theory guided material design, (aminomethyl) piperidinium quasi-2D perovskites are selected. The lowest energy distribution and homogeneous energy landscape are achieved through carefully regulating their crystallization kinetics. We conclude that homogeneous energy landscape significantly reduces the Shockley-Read-Hall recombination and suppresses the quasi-Fermi level splitting, which is crucial to achieve high
V oc .

Introduction The certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of three-dimensional (3D) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has reached 25.2% 1 , 2 . However, the device stability is still undesirable, which severely hinders their commercialization process 3 , 4 . To date, reduced-dimensional (quasi-2D) perovskites are believed to be the most successful attempt to address the instability problems 5 , 6 . Quasi-2D perovskite is generated by slicing 3D perovskite along one of its crystallographic plane, and subsequently incorporating bulky organic cations to separate the inorganic slabs 7 . The resulting derivatives exhibit greatly improved stability, especially the low ‘quantum-well’ thickness (< n > value) species 8 , 9 . However, PCE for these quasi-2D photovoltaics still lags far behind their 3D counterpart. In particular, the devices display low open-circuit voltage ( V oc ), indicating the existence of non-negligible nonradiative recombination. Further performance improvement solely relies on deeper understanding of the device operation mechanism. However, carrier transport in quasi-2D films is complicated and still quite elusive to date. As far as we know, multiple < n > value species are created during the crystallization. Accordingly, efficient cascade energy transfer takes place among different < n > value species, and the carriers would eventually concentrate to the lowest bandgap species 10 . Great success has accomplished in perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) by taking advantage of this phenomenon 11 . Nevertheless, photovoltaics rely on completely opposite operation mechanism compared with PeLEDs, which requires carriers to get separated rather than get recombined. Therefore, we point out that the aforementioned cascade energy transfer that is caused by the inhomogeneous energy landscape will degenerate photovoltaic performance due to the following reasons. First, energy transfer dynamics is demonstrated to dominate the carrier transport in quasi-2D films, because the cascade energy transfer typically happens at a very early stage after photoexcitation. From the viewpoint of carrier dynamics, carrier transit time across the
p - n
junction is much longer than the energy transfer timescale, when considering the carrier mobility and film thickness 12 . This implies that the photocarriers generating in the high bandgap species would thermally relax to the band edge of the smallest bandgap species at first, and then get separated under the built-in electric field. This cooling process inevitably results in extra energy loss, and the overall device’s
V oc
is thus limited by the smallest bandgap species 13 . Second, severe energy disorder exists in the quasi-2D perovskite films, which is mainly induced by the inhomogeneous energy landscape 14 . High degree of energy disorder widens the distribution of electronic states and creates band tail states, which have been proved to lead to notable
V oc
loss in both organic and quantum dot photovoltaics 15 , 16 . Hence, it is foreseen that quasi-2D perovskite photovoltaics should suffer from the energy disorder as well. In summary, the inhomogeneous energy landscape deteriorates the device performance by introducing extra energy loss, creating band tail states, and inhibiting minority carrier transport. Therefore, quasi-2D perovskite film with homogeneous energy landscape is proposed here to address the problems. However, the approach is still highly challenging and rarely explored yet. Fortunately, significant advances have been made toward deeply understanding the quasi-2D film’s formation kinetics and the resulting band structure. Proppe et al. 17
first reported a quasi-2D perovskite film whose bandgaps concentrated at 1.65 eV, through judiciously selecting the allylammonium ligand. Zhou et al. 18
also demonstrated that the < n > value distribution could be controlled by introducing methylammonium chloride additive. Subsequently, Shao et al. 19
successfully tuned the energy landscape of perovskite films via a vacuum-assisted method. Reduced low < n > value components favorably promoted the carrier transport and effectively suppressed the charge recombination. These films featuring high < n > value phases achieved improved performance. Nevertheless, to some extent, they sacrificed the natural stability advantages of quasi-2D perovskites. Therefore, achieving homogeneous energy landscape in low < n > value regions is necessary to ensure both performance and stability of the PSCs. The knowledge thus leverages us an opportunity to realize homogeneous energy landscape via material design and crystallization dynamics engineering. According to previous report, the polydispersity of < n > values is highly dependent on the spatial distribution of organic cations in precursor solution 14 . In principle, narrow < n > value-distributed quasi-2D films are formed, once the organic cations become homogeneously distributed. Moreover, it is reasonable to minimize the band offsets between adjacent < n > value species by judiciously selecting the material structure. The reduced band offsets thereby flatten the overall band structure, and help to create the homogeneous energy landscape. Based on the above inspiration, we thus conceive a synergistic approach to realize homogeneous energy landscape by taking advantage of both material structure and crystallization kinetic regulation. With the help of the density functional theory (DFT) simulation, a
meta -(aminomethyl) piperidinium (MAMP) quasi-2D perovskite film is fabricated, which possesses an overall flatter band structure. Furthermore, MAMP film with a homogeneous energy landscape is realized by carefully regulating the crystallization kinetics. The energy dispersion of the corresponding film is much smaller than the control,
n -butylammonium (BA) film. Electrical characterizations confirm that the homogeneous energy landscape decreases the defect density and reduces the film’s energy disorder. We then correlate the relationship between homogeneous energy landscape and device performance. The physical origin of
V loss
has been thoroughly investigated by various electrical analyses and solar cell capacitance simulator (SCAPS) simulation. Minimal
V loss
was achieved owing to the reduced nonradiative recombination and energy disorder, which is induced by the homogeneous energy landscape. The device exhibits an excellent PCE of 16.53%, accompanied by a high
V oc
of 1.21 V. In addition, the device exhibits significantly improved stability compared with traditional hot-casting films due to the more ideal vertical phase alignment, which retains almost 90% of the initial PCE after 1000 h of storage. Results DFT simulation-guided material design Flattening the overall band structure of a quasi-2D film is equal to reducing the band offsets between the adjacent quasi-2D species (Fig.  1a ). Accordingly, the goal can be indirectly realized by minimizing the individual quasi-2D perovskites’ bandgap. Organic cations can affect the quasi-2D perovskites’ lattice structure via versatile hydrogen bond types. The discrepancy makes huge impact on the resulting energy level through the degree of octahedral tilting and interlayer electronic coupling strength. Accordingly, interlayer electronic coupling participates in antibonding interactions via van der Waals halide–halide interactions. Short halide–halide distance affords strong antibonding interactions, which push up the valence band maximum (VBM) in principle 20 . Meanwhile, octahedral tilting affords new hybrid orbitals by mixing
s
and
p
orbitals of halide. The hybridization determines the conduction band minimum (CBM) antibonding between
p
orbitals of metal and
s / p
hybrid orbitals of halide. Small octahedral tilting pushes up the VBM and pushes down the CBM, resulting in the reduced bandgap 21 , 22 . Fig. 1: Device operation mechanism and DFT simulation. a

perovskite single crystals ( n  = 1, 2, 3, 4) measured by UPS. Full size image Accordingly, minimizing the octahedral tilting and reducing the interlayer distance are the keys to flatten the band structure, which requires us to judiciously examine the organic cation and the resulting lattice geometry. We noticed that a series of Dion-Jacobson phase (DJ) quasi-2D perovskites that were first reported by Kanatzidis and colleagues 20
might potentially meet the requirements 20 . The DJ perovskites were characterized with divalent interlayer spacers. The immobile divalent cations pushed the inorganic slabs close to each other. Accordingly, MAMP quasi-2D perovskites exhibited the shortest interlayer halide–halide distance (about 4.0 Å) among all the quasi-2D perovskites reported to date (Supplementary Fig.  1 ) 23 , 24 . In addition, negligible octahedral tilting was found in MAMP perovskites, since the axial Pb–I–Pb angles are close to 180° (Supplementary Fig.  2 ). In principle, short halide–halide distance and negligible octahedral tilting should decrease the bandgap, which subsequently reduced the band offsets and enabled the films to possess a relatively flatter overall band structure. DFT simulation was used to simulate the band structure for perovskites (Supplementary Note  1 ). Detailed [PbI 6 ] 4−
octahedron distortion was calculated through the bond angle variance (BAV) and distortion index (DI) (Fig.  1b ) 25 , 26 . MAMP perovskite exhibited a smaller average BAV and DI than BA perovskite, indicating less octahedral tilting. In addition, we simulated the spinor density to illustrate the interlayer coupling strength of I–I (Fig.  1c ). As expected, MAMP perovskite reflected stronger antibonding interactions compared with BA perovskite. As a result, MAMP perovskites exhibited a smaller bandgap compared with regular BA perovskites (Supplementary Figs.  3
and
4 ). High-quality (MAMP)MA n −1 Pb n I 3 n +1
and (BA) 2 MA n −1 Pb n I 3 n +1
( n  = 1, 2, 3, 4) single crystals (SCs) (Supplementary Figs.  7 – 9 ) were obtained by an improved solvent growth method. CBM and VBM positions for these SCs were measurement through their absorption spectra (Fig.  1d, e ) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectrometer (UPS) (Fig.  1f , Supplementary Figs.  5
and
6 , and Supplementary Tables  1
and
2 ). As shown, the measured bandgap for MAMP SCs’ each
n
value was greatly smaller than BA ones. Thereby, VBM and CBM band offsets between adjacent
n
values reduced in MAMP SCs. Consequently, the bandgap energy dispersion from
n  = 1 to
n  = 4 species was calculated to be 0.33 eV for MAMP perovskite, which was much lower than BA case (0.52 eV). Crystallization kinetics regulation Corresponding quasi-2D films were fabricated by single-step spin-coating process with the aid of antisolvents. The quasi-2D perovskite films’ formation kinetics need to be well controlled to achieve narrow < n > value distribution. Previous research demonstrated that colloidal precursor sol-gel, MA + /PbI \({}_{x^{-}}\)
complexes, formed spontaneously in the precursor solution 27 . The colloids provided nucleation sites for the subsequent crystallization (Fig.  2a ), which accelerated the crystallization speed locally. Lower < n > value quasi-2D perovskites crystallized with high priority, since they possess lower crystallization energy barrier compared with higher < n > value analogs. As a result, local organic cation shortage appeared due to the intense consummation of organic cations. Accordingly, higher < n > value quasi-2D or quasi-3D perovskites precipitated in sequence, leading to a broad < n > value distribution. Fig. 2: Crystallization kinetics regulation. a

with grazing-incidence angle of 0.3°, respectively. Full size image Apparently, eliminating the complex colloids is essential to avoid the broad < n > value distribution. Previous research has demonstrated the manipulation of the colloidal concentration by modulating the solution pH 28 . In particular, acidic additives were shown to be able to dissolve the pre-formed colloids. Accordingly, here we reported introducing 2-aminophenol-4-sulfonic acid (APSA) to suppress the colloids’ formation (Supplementary Fig.  11 ). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was used to monitor the colloids’ size and concentration. As shown in Fig.  2b , the colloids with the average size around 400, 250, and 180 nm were observed for MAPbI 3 , BA, and pristine MAMP precursor solution, respectively. In contrast, no colloid was found in MAMP precursors treated with APSA, indicating that colloids have been suppressed. We also investigated the resulting films’ crystallization rate by recording the evolution of absorption spectra (Supplementary Fig.  12 ). As shown, the crystallization time for APSA-treated MAMP film was much longer than the pristine MAMP film, illustrating that total nucleation sites decreased. The phenomenon was in coherence with the DLS interpretation. Moreover, APSA-treated MAMP film exhibited the least high < n > value phases by comparing their absorption spectra (Supplementary Figs.  13 – 15 ). We then investigated the quasi-2D perovskite’ crystal orientation and phase composition by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). All the films displayed the sharp and discrete Bragg spots (Fig.  2c–e ), indicating that the crystals were highly oriented and packed. The discrete Bragg spots were assigned to (1 1 1), (1 0 1), and (2 0 2) planes through indexing the Bragg peaks. The dominant in-plane stacking of the (1 0 1), (2 0 2) facets points to the ( h   0   l ) facets that were oriented parallel to the substrate, confirming the inorganic slabs perpendicular to the substrate. As a result, highly vertically oriented quasi-2D perovskite films finally formed. Moreover, the GIWAXS patterns indicated the existence of the < n > = 2 phase in BA and pristine MAMP films, which was not observed in APSA-treated MAMP film. We further investigated whether vertical < n > value distribution was increased by the grazing-incidence angles (Fig.  2f–h ). Debye-Scherrer rings, (1 1 0) and (2 2 0) planes, belonging to high < n > values or 3D perovskites, were observed at the bottom of BA and pristine MAMP films with a larger grazing-incidence angle. However, APSA-treated MAMP film exhibited almost identical Bragg spots, which support that the narrowest < n > value distribution existed in the film. Carrier dynamics in quasi-2D perovskite film Ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy technique was utilized to investigate carrier dynamics in quasi-2D perovskite films. The films were initially pumped from the front side (air side), and Fig.
3a–d
showed their ground-state bleaching (GSB) signals. As expected, some obvious GSB peaks were displayed in each TA spectra, indicating that mixed < n > value species coexisted in films. However, the energy distribution, Δ E , for a pristine MAMP film was calculated to be about 0.40 eV, which was smaller than the control BA one (about 0.52 eV). The reason for this was due to the reduced band offsets in pristine MAMP film, and the phenomenon was consistent with SC characterization. Notably, as shown in Fig.  3d , < n > = 2 GSB peak disappeared in APSA-treated MAMP film, which was in agreement with GIWAXS data. Furthermore, GSB signals ascribed to the larger < n > value species also significantly diminished after APSA treatment. In short, TA data confirmed that the narrowest < n > value-distributed film was realized after APSA treatment. Δ E
for APSA-treated MAMP film reduced to about 0.26 eV, owing to the synergistic effect of the band structure and crystallization dynamics management. It is worth mentioning that Δ E
represents the narrowest energy distribution for low
<n > value quasi-2D perovskite films reported to date. Fig. 3: Carrier dynamics of quasi-2D perovskite films. Schematic of quasi-2D perovskite films excited from

TA kinetics extracted from different GSB ( n  = 3, 4, 5) at front-side excitation for different films. Full size image The films’ vertical phase distribution was examined via TA and photoluminescence (PL) spectra. As shown in Fig.  3e–h , pumping direction had an obvious effect on the GSB peak position. When the films were pumped from the glass side, the GSB peak intensity for higher < n > value species greatly enhanced compared with air-side pumping. The differences became more obvious in PL spectra. As shown in Fig.  4a , luminescence peak featuring of low < n > values governed the PL spectra in air-side excitation case. On the contrary, high < n > value PL peaks dominated when excited from the glass side. Accordingly, both TA and PL data implied that low < n > value phases prefer to stay close to the perovskite film surface, while the high < n > value species tend to stay at the bottom. Particularly, the vertical phase distribution of our films was totally reverse compared with the traditional hot-casting films, in which the high < n > value phases tend to stay on the top. Apparently, our films should display improved film stability compared with the traditional films. In addition, our films should be more suitable for the conventional device architecture, on account of the vertical energy-level alignment 18 . In short, graded MAMP quasi-2D perovskite films with homogeneous energy landscape have been achieved here. Fig. 4: Optoelectronic properties of quasi-2D perovskite films. a

Carrier diffusion length for both electron and hole was calculated from the optical method. Full size image Detailed carrier dynamics was analyzed by extracting decay kinetics from TA spectra. As shown in Fig.  3i–l , spontaneous electron transfer from low < n > value species to high < n > value species was observed in all films. Figure  3l
illustrates the dynamic evolution of APSA-treated MAMP film. The < n > = 3 bleaching appeared at 0.1 ps, then an ultrafast decay was observed. The low < n > bleaching recovery kinetics was accompanied with the buildup of the high < n > bleaching, and the formation of the < n > = 5 bleaching was delayed to 0.4 ps. Moreover, BA and pristine MAMP films displayed slow charge transfer dynamics, which would lead to charge accumulation in low < n > value species. It thus increased the possibility of exciton annihilation and minority carrier recombination. As expected, APSA-treated MAMP film displayed the fastest decay time in the low < n > value domain. The same result could be obtained by its steady-state PL spectra (Fig.  4a ). A strikingly strong and sharp PL peak appeared in APSA-treated MAMP film. The relative small band offsets between adjacent < n > value species certainly reduced the energy barrier and facilitated the carrier migration. The ultrafast charge transfer process then suppressed the carrier recombination. Optoelectronic property characterization Carrier dynamics analysis indicated that homogeneous energy landscape should induce less defect density, increased minority carrier mobility, and elongated diffusion length. Detailed optical and electrical characterizations have been carried out to confirm the speculation. We first extracted the films’ carrier lifetime through time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurement. As shown in Fig.  4b , the average decay lifetime ( τ ave ) for APSA-treated MAMP film was longer than the other two films, suggesting reduced nonradiative recombination. Efficient minority carrier transport is very essential in photovoltaic operation, which plays a key role in determining the quasi-2D device performance. Accordingly, we extracted electron mobility for these films through the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) technique. As shown in Fig.  4d–f , the electron mobility for BA film was determined to be 1.65 × 10 −3  cm 2  V −1  s −1 , which was consistent with the previous report. In contrast, APSA-treated MAMP film exhibited one order of magnitude higher electron mobility, 2.13 × 10 −2  cm 2  V −1  s −1 , indicating more efficient minority carrier transport realized in this homogeneous energy landscape. The elongated carrier lifetime and enhanced minority carrier mobility indicated reduced defect density. Through SCLC, we investigated the defect density to understand its physical origins. As expected, the defect density for APSA-treated MAMP film was found to be more than one order of magnitude lower than BA or pristine MAMP films. It is controversial whether the SCLC technique can accurately evaluate the defect density for perovskites, considering the notorious ‘ion migration.’ We thereby measured the defect density again through thermal admittance spectroscopy (TAS), to characterize shallow and deep defects of quasi-2D perovskite films 29 . As shown in Fig.  4c , APSA-treated MAMP film again exhibited the lowest defect density of states ( t DOS) over the whole trap depth. The inherent trap density of MAMP perovskite crystal was lesser than that of BA one (Supplementary Fig.  10 ). Furthermore, sulfonic acid passivation and homogeneous energy landscape contributed to reducing defect states 30 , 31 . As a result, APSA-treated MAMP film exhibited the lowest trap-assisted recombination, as shown in density-dependent TRPL spectra (Supplementary Fig.  16 ). We evaluated the diffusion length ( L D ) via a well-established optical method. A hole or electron quencher was placed on the top of perovskite films, and a fast PL quenching was found on APSA-treated MAMP film (Fig.  4g, h
and Supplementary Fig.  17 ). The corresponding hole ( L D–h ) or electron ( L D–e ) diffusion length could be extracted by comparing their bimolecular recombination lifetime with and without the quencher 32 . The approximate value of
L D
was estimated by using the following equation: $$L_{\mathrm{D}} \approx \frac{{2d}}{\pi }\sqrt {2\left( {\frac{{\tau _2}}{{\tau _{2,{\mathrm{quench}}}}} - 1} \right)},$$
(1)
where
d
is the film thickness,
τ 2,quench
and
τ 2
represent the bimolecular recombination lifetime with and without the quencher. As shown in Fig.  4i , the
L D–h
and
L D–e
for the control BA film were calculated to be about 200 and 300 nm, which was consistent with previous results 17 . Accordingly, APSA-treated MAMP film exhibited almost three times elongated diffusion length for both hole and electron. The overall optical and electrical characterizations proved that significant improvement on semiconducting properties has reached by forming a homogeneous energy landscape. The outstanding semiconducting property of materials motivated us to further investigate the photovoltaic performance of devices, and deeply understand the physical origin at the device level. As aforementioned, our films’ vertical phase distribution was totally reverse to the traditional film. The resulting graded band structure indicated that conventional device architecture is more suitable for charge transport and collection. Relationship between energy disorder and
V
oc
loss Planar photovoltaic devices with conventional architecture of ITO/TiO 2 /perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au were fabricated (Supplementary Fig.  18 ). The resulting device performance is shown in Fig.  5a . As shown, BA device delivered a PCE of 11.76%, with a
V oc
of 1.08 V, and fill factor (FF) of 64%. The value well aligned with the reported PCE for low < n > value quasi-2D photovoltaics 8 . As revealed, the PCE mainly was limited by the relatively low FF and
V oc , indicating inefficient carrier transport and collection. In particular, the
V oc
loss determined as high as 0.55 V, in consideration of the bandgap of 1.63 V for < n > = 4 BA perovskite. Pristine MAMP perovskite possessed a relatively flatter band structure and exhibited a PCE of 14.14%, with slightly improved FF and reduced
V oc
loss. Notably, a stable and hysteresis-free 16.53% PCE of APSA-treated MAMP perovskites was obtained (Supplementary Figs.  19 a and
20 – 22
and Supplementary Table  3 ). It was encouraging that high
V oc
(1.21 V) was obtained, indicating a very low
V oc
loss (0.47 V) (Supplementary Fig.  23 ). From the
V oc
evolution trend, it is obvious that flattening the overall band structure was beneficial in reducing
V oc
loss. Fig. 5: Photovoltaic performance and

devices fabricated by traditional hot-casting method, under humidity of 40–50% RH (relative humidity). Full size image The low
V oc
loss motivated us to investigate its physical origin. As aforementioned, quasi-2D perovskite film is a mixed film with anisotropic transport, which severely suffers from energy disorder. The origin of the disorder can be classified as band structure, charge transport, and phase distribution disorder. It is a well-known energy disorder that introduces band tail states in the bandgap. The nonequilibrium photocarriers thus tend to relax down to these electronic states, thereby affecting the quasi-Fermi level splitting. Band tail states filled with carriers represent the effective bandgap ( \({E}_{{\mathrm{g}}}^{{\prime}}\) ) that determines the maximum attainable
V oc
of quasi-2D perovskite device 16 . In principle, achieving low- energy disorder films with reduced band tail states is very critical, in order to minimize the
V oc
deficit. To evaluate the energy disorder in these films, we extracted the Urbach tail ( E U ).
E U
was quantified via the density of localized band tail states; a higher
E U
was indicative of more disorder 33 .
E U
was quantified from the slope of the exponential external quantum efficiency (EQE) plots (Supplementary Fig.  24 ), which is proportional to exp[( E   −   E g )/ E U ]. As shown in Fig.  5b , the sharpest band tail was observed for APSA-treated MAMP perovskite device, which yields the lowest
E U
of about 18.13 meV. It was worth mentioning that the extracted
E U
was comparable to the values reported in 3D perovskite, since a room temperature Urbach tail of 13–15 meV was typically observed in high-quality 3D perovskite films. Energy disorder at the device level could be directly probed by measuring the distribution of the electronic DOS. The distribution of DOS is expressed in the following equation: 34 $$g\left( {E - E_{\mathrm{L}}} \right) = \frac{N}{{\sqrt {2\pi } \sigma }}{\mathrm{exp}}\left[ { - \frac{{\left( {E_{\mathrm{L}} - E} \right)^2}}{{2\sigma ^2}}} \right],$$
(2)
where
σ
is the disorder parameter;
N
and
E L
represent the total density per unit volume and the energy center of the DOS, respectively. As we know, chemical capacitance ( C µ ) reflects the capability of accepting or releasing additional carriers for photovoltaics. The change in the capability shifts the quasi-Fermi level when it moves across the electronic states 35 . By fitting the data (Supplementary Fig.  25 ), APSA-treated MAMP perovskite exhibited the lowest
σ , 91 meV (Fig.  5c ). The variation trend for
σ
was consistent with the Urbach tail measurement, indicating that the homogeneous energy landscape did decrease the corresponding film’s energy disorder. V
oc
loss mechanism at the device level Besides, with the effective bandgap, the
V oc
loss induced by nanoradiative recombination is another source to affect the attainable
V oc . We then investigated the
V oc
loss mechanism using classical semiconductor theory, to uncover the recombination pathway.
V oc
can be expressed in this well-known equation: $$eV_{{\mathrm{oc}}} = E_{\mathrm{g}}^{\prime} - k_{\mathrm{B}}T{\mathrm{ln}}\left( {\frac{{\beta N_{\mathrm{c}}N_{\mathrm{v}}}}{G}} \right),$$
(3)
where
\({E}_{\mathrm{g}}^{\prime}\)
represents the effective bandgap;
N c
and
N v
represent the effective DOS in conduction and valence bands;
k B
is the Boltzmann constant;
G
is the carrier generation rate;
β
is the radiative recombination rate constant. The well-known diode ideality factor,
m , is used to describe the dominating recombination mechanism. At the device level, the carrier generation rate
G
is the sum of thermal-generated portion
G t
and optical portion
G opt . The
G t
is equal to the thermal recombination rate in the dark as $$G_{\mathrm{t}} = \beta N_{\mathrm{c}}N_{\mathrm{v}}{\mathrm{exp}}\left( { - \frac{{E_{\mathrm{g}}}}{{k_{\mathrm{B}}T}}} \right).$$
(4)
The carrier generation rate can be experimentally measured from the reverse-bias saturation dark current density ( J 0 ) and reverse-bias saturation photocurrent density ( J sc ). We then can rewrite the equation as $$V_{{\mathrm{oc}}} = \frac{{mk_{\mathrm{B}}T}}{e}{\mathrm{ln}}\left( {\frac{{J_{{\mathrm{sc}}}}}{{J_0}} + 1} \right).$$
(5)
In principle,
m  = 1 represents direct bimolecular recombination.
m  = 2 indicates a Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination dominated, which means indirect recombination by trapping of minority carriers. As shown in Fig.  5d , the obtained
J 0
of APSA-treated MAMP device was around one order of magnitude smaller than that of BA and pristine MAMP device. The lower
J 0
proved that lower shallower defect states existed in the system, which was in good agreement with previous measurement. Ideality factor was extracted by estimating the slope of the semilogarithmic current density–voltage ( J–V ) curve in the diffusion-dominated current region. As shown in Fig.  5d , the ideality factor was determined to be 1.48 for APSA-treated MAMP device, which was the lowest value among the devices. The same trend could also be demonstrated by
V oc
evolution for different illumination intensities (Supplementary Fig.  26 ). A low ideality factor indicated that trap-assistant SRH recombination was suppressed in the homogeneous energy landscape film. Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrated that APSA-treated MAMP device possessed the lowest charge transport resistance ( R ct ), and the highest charge recombination resistance ( R rec ) (Supplementary Fig.  27 ). The charge transport lifetime ( τ tr ) and the charge recombination lifetime ( τ rec ) were estimated from the transient photocurrent and transient photovoltage measurements, respectively (Supplementary Fig.  28 ). APSA-treated MAMP device showed faster photocurrent decay but slower photovoltage decay than the other two analogs, indicating that homogeneous energy landscape did improve the carrier transport and reduce the recombination. In the next step, to quantitatively evaluate and correlate the recombination rate with the
V oc
and device performance, we rewrite the equation based on a balance analysis of absorbed and emitted photons 36 . We then found
$$V_{\mathrm{oc}}=\frac{K_{\mathrm{B}}T}{e} {\mathrm{In}}\left({\mathrm{EQE}}_{\mathrm{EL}}\frac{J_{\mathrm{photo}}}{J_{\mathrm{dark}}}+1\right) ≈\, V_{\mathrm{oc,rad}}-\frac{K_{\mathrm{B}}T}{e}{\mathrm{In}}{\mathrm{{EQE}}_{\mathrm{EL}}^{-1}}.$$
(6)
The second term refers to the
V oc
loss induced by the nonradiative recombination. The
V oc
loss can be determined through the measurement of electroluminescence EQE (EQE EL ) of quasi-2D perovskite devices (Fig.  5e ). Compared with BA and pristine MAMP devices, APSA-treated MAMP device exhibited the highest EQE EL
of 0.15%. By consideration the Shockley-Queisser limit, 1.40 V is the theoretical radiative limit of
V oc
for quasi-2D perovskites with a bandgap of 1.68 eV 37 . Attainable
V oc
for APSA-treated MAMP perovskite should be around 1.23 V, which is close to our experimental data. Hence, various electrical and optical measurements confirmed that the homogeneous energy landscape did significantly reduce the energy disorder and decrease the defect states. The subsequently reduced band tail states and decreased SRH recombination lead to more ideal diode behaviors, which could be directly responsible for minimal
V oc
loss. To correlate the relationship between energy-level homogeneity and device performance, SCAPS simulation (Supplementary Table  4
and Supplementary Note  2 ) was carried to simulate device performance for MAMP devices with different energy disorder 38 , using the measured experimental optoelectronic parameters. As shown in Fig.  5f , SCAPS simulation revealed that the increased energy disorder significantly caused the
V oc
deficit, accompanied by the FF shrinking and a decreased PCE, which reflected the same trend with our experimental data. We then evaluated the stability of unencapsulated devices under conditions of 40–50% relative humidity. As shown in Fig.  5g , the control device, BA perovskite that was fabricated by the traditional hot-casting method (Supplementary Fig.  19b ), underwent a significant degradation, which only retained 68% of its original PCE after 1000 h. This was not surprising since the high
<n > value phases tended to stay at the top, according to previous discussion. The high
<n > value species were not robust enough, which was responsible for the faster degradation. On the contrary, low
<n > value species tended to stay on the top in APSA-treated MAMP film. The resulting device displayed negligible degradation under the same atmosphere, retaining almost 92% PCE after 1000 h. Even though the
<n > value distribution was very narrow, the robust low
<n > value species still showed advantages and provided better protection to humidity. We also tracked the light and thermal stability of the devices (Supplementary Fig.  29 ). APSA-treated MAMP devices still maintained more than 90% of their initial PCE, under 1-Sun illumination for 505 h, or under 80 °C heat treatment for 217 h. Moreover, X-ray diffraction patterns also confirmed that APSA-treated MAMP films exhibited better stability than BA ones under humidity, light, and thermal environments (Supplementary Fig.  30 ). As shown, lead iodide peaks were observed in the aged BA film. In contrast, no significant change was observed for APSA-treated MAMP film. It has been proven that DJ-phase quasi-2D perovskites typically exhibit stronger rigidity and interlayer connection than Ruddlesden-Popper-phase ones 39 . Discussion In summary, we have demonstrated that the homogeneous energy landscape is essential to achieve high-performance quasi-2D perovskite photovoltaics, especially high
V oc . Toward this goal, we conceive synergistic strategy to accomplish homogeneous energy landscape, by taking advantage of material structure and crystallization kinetics engineering. With the help of the DFT-guided material design, minimization of the band offsets has been achieved in MAMP-based quasi-2D perovskite, which results in the lowest energy distribution in the SC state to date. On top of this, we further regulate the crystallization kinetics to realize a narrow < n > value distribution for MAMP film. As a result, a homogeneous energy landscape is formed in APSA-treated MAMP film. We correlate the relationship between the energy landscape homogeneity and device performance, and further investigate the physical origin of low
V loss . Owing to the reduced nonradiative recombination induced by the homogeneous energy landscape, the device achieves an excellent PCE of 16.53%, accompanied by a high
V oc
of 1.21 V. In addition, the device exhibits significantly improved stability compared with traditional hot-casting films, due to the more ideal vertical phase alignment and absent high < n > value phases. As a result, APSA-treated MAMP retains almost 92% of the initial PCE after 1000 h of storage. Methods Materials All chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and Lumtec Corp without further purification. TiO 2
nanocrystals were synthesized according to the previous procedure 40 . Perovskite SC synthesis BA 2 MA n −1 Pb n I 3 n +1
SCs were grown by using an improved cooling method. Briefly, mixed PbO, MAI, and BAI at different ratios were dissolved in hydroiodic acid (HI) solution at  about 90 °C. The resulting solution was filtered and gradually cooled down to 20 °C at a rate of 1 °C h −1 . For MAMPMA n −1 Pb n I 3 n +1
SCs, different ratios of PbO, MAI, and MAMPI mixture were dissolved in 30 mL of HI solution at about 110 °C. The resulting solution cooled down to 20 °C at a rate of 0.5 °C h −1 . As-grown perovskite crystals were wiped and rinsed with diethyl ether to remove the surface residues. Device fabrication The cleaned ITO glass substrates were treated using an ultraviolet zone for 10 min prior to remove the organic residues. TiO 2
nanocrystals were spin-coated on ITO substrates at 3000 r.p.m. for 30 s, and annealed for 30 min at 150 °C. The substrates were then transferred to nitrogen-filled glovebox to deposit perovskite absorbers. The corresponding precursors for (BA) 2 MA 3 Pb 4 I 13
and pristine (MAMP)MA 3 Pb 4 I 13
were prepared and weighted at the stoichiometric ratio. The mixtures were dissolved in the mixed solvent, DMF:DMSO (dimethylformamide:dimethyl sulfoxide), which equals 7:3, to set the final concentration at 1.4 M. For APSA-treated (MAMP)MA 3 Pb 4 I 13
film, APSA was directly introduced into the pristine (MAMP)MA 3 Pb 4 I 13
perovskite solution with different concentrations. Accordingly, the precursor solutions were spin-coated on top of the TiO 2
film at 4000 r.p.m. for 50 s, and 200 μl of ethyl acetate was dropped onto the film during the process, followed by annealing process at 130 °C for 15 min. The prepared Spiro-OMeTAD solution was then deposited at 4000 r.p.m. for 30 s. Finally, about 100 nm of gold electrode was thermally evaporated on the top of films at a pressure of 5 × 10 −6  mbar.

V oc , was first measured using a Keithley 2400 instrument by fixing the current to 0, and sampling the voltage at multiple time points. The steady-state
J sc , was measured via setting the bias voltage to 0, and sampling the current at multiple time points. Then the instantaneous
J–V
curves were measured at a scanning rate of 50 mV s −1
with delay time of 200 ms and voltage step of 10 mV. The active area of 0.049 cm 2
was determined by an aperture, and the output of the light source was adjusted via a calibrated silicon photodiode (Newport) at 1 Sun (100 mW cm −2 ). The AM 1.5 solar power was supplied by a class A solar simulator (Enli Tech) with the mismatch factor less than 25%. The spectral mismatch factor (less than 5%) of the system was characterized using a calibrated reference solar cell (Newport). The EQE spectra of devices were obtained following a previously reported process. DLS characterization DLS measurements were performed by a Zetasizer Nano ZS instrument (Malvern Instruments, UK) with a 633-nm He–Ne laser. The perovskite precursor solutions are transferred into the quartz cuvettes and sealed in a N 2
glovebox. The measurement was done at room temperature. GIWAXS characterization GIWAXS patterns of quasi-2D perovskite films were measured on the beamline 1W2A at Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF), China. A monochromatic beam (1.54 Å) was used at 0.1° and 0.3° of grazing-incidence angles. All films were measured via the same exposure time of 240 s. GIWAXS patterns were collected at a beam energy of 10 keV by an area detector with 3450 × 3450-pixel resolution. GIWAXS raw patterns were corrected by GIXSGUI MATLAB toolbox. The ultrafast TA spectroscopy characterization TA measurements of quasi-2D films were carried out by a Helios pump–probe system (Ultrafast Systems LLC) with an amplified femtosecond laser system (Coherent, 35 fs, 7 mJ per pulse, 1 kHz, 800 nm). Thepump pulses (365 nm, 8 nJ per pulse) were generated by an optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS-800-fs). Focusing the 800-nm beams (split from the regenerative amplifier with a tiny portion, 400 nJ per pulse) onto a sapphire plate produced the white-light continuum (WLC) probe pulses. The pulse-to-pulse fluctuation of the WLC was corrected by a reference beam split from WLC. A motorized optical delay line was served as a tool to change the time delays between pump and probe pulses. The instrument response function (100 fs) was determined via a routine cross-correlation procedure. A mechanical chopper (500 Hz) modulated the pump pulses. Temporal and spectral profiles (chirp-corrected) of the WLC probe light were visualized through the optical fiber-coupled multichannel spectrometer [with a CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) sensor] and the Surface Xplorer software.

Abstract
The addition of a polar-hydrophobic methylammonium trifluoroacetate ionic liquid tailors the hydrophobicity of halide-perovskite precursor solutions and assists in grain growth. This unique additive also functionalizes the grain boundaries
via
polar–polar interactions, thereby enhancing the optoelectronic properties and chemical stability of perovskites. This study opens the door to the solution hydrophobicity control towards high-performance perovskite devices.

Abstract
Halide perovskites have recently emerged as promising materials for low-cost, high-efficiency solar cells. The efficiency of perovskite-based solar cells has increased rapidly, from 3.8% in 2009 to 19.3% in 2014, by using the all-solid-state thin-film architecture and engineering cell structures with mixed-halide perovskites. The emergence of perovskite solar cells revolutionized the field not only because of their rapidly increased efficiency, but also flexibility in material growth and architecture. The superior performance of the perovskite solar cells suggested that perovskite materials possess intrinsically unique properties. In this review, we summarize recent theoretical investigations into the structural, electrical, and optical properties of halide perovskite materials in relation to their applications in solar cells. We also discuss some current challenges of using perovskites in solar cells, along with possible theoretical solutions.

Main Metal halide perovskites have fascinated the research community over the past six years, largely due to a combination of their high-quality optoelectronic properties — unexpected for materials processed from solution and at low temperature — and the apparent ease with which they can be employed as absorber layers in highly efficient photovoltaic (PV) devices 1 . Perovskites typically adopt a 3D crystal structure composed of three primary ions with a stoichiometry of ABX 3 . For the all-inorganic compounds, caesium is the A-cation, and either lead or tin are the B cation, with halides of chlorine, bromine or iodine as the X anion. The ‘hybrid’ perovskite compounds, which have shown most promise so far, have either methylammonium (MA) or formamidinium (FA) as the A cation. Some of the most efficient and stable compounds even have multiple mixtures of ions at the A and X sites 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . The rich variety of compositions and the multitude of ways in which they can be investigated have fostered burgeoning interest in perovskites and related compounds. Since the first reports in 2012, metal halide perovskites were well on their way to deliver high PV performance 1 , and now single-junction cells are already approaching power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23% 6 . Yet, beyond high efficiency, other critical factors are required for a PV ‘concept’ to transition from the laboratory to real-world deployment and use, with ambition to reach TW-scale production capacity. These include low materials and manufacturing costs, high stability and independence from rare elements. The major components in the perovskite compounds, lead and iodine, are abundant materials, and low cost appears to be preordained. Demonstrating long-term stability, however, has raised major concerns 5 . In general, there is a sense that the properties that make perovskites such remarkable semiconductors, which are yet to be fully understood, may also be the properties that are more challenging to control for long-term stability 7 . However, if progress in materials and device engineering will enable long-term PV module deployment, then such improved operational stability, combined with the ease of formation of high-quality materials and devices, will place perovskites at the ideal spot to trigger profound transformation in the PV market. In this Comment, the present status in research and directions where further research effort is required will be discussed, but not comprehensively reviewed, along with the status and challenges for technology transfer and commercialization of perovskite PVs. Status in research Researchers have demonstrated how to routinely obtain perovskite solar cells with efficiency beyond 20%, through changes in materials composition, processing conditions and device architectures. Reaching the maximum theoretical performance in single- and multi-junction solar cells and demonstrating stability over 25 years require further understanding of the optoelectronic properties of metal halide perovskite devices and of how they can be controlled with further chemistry and device architecture optimization. Solar cells with high external radiative efficiency Miller, Yablonovitch and Kurtz 8
popularized the notion that a good solar cell must also be a good light-emitting diode. When all non-essential charge recombination paths are eliminated, such as trap-assisted recombination at defect or impurity sites, charges present in the active material can only recombine through radiation of light. Thus, bright electroluminescence from a PV cell operating in forward bias (Fig.
1a ), typically measured when the dark recombination current equals the short-circuit photocurrent under sunlight, is a signature that a smaller and smaller fraction of recombination occurs via non-radiative channels. The external radiative efficiency (ERE) of a PV cell — which is the fraction of total dark recombination current that results in the emission of light — is a good indicator of how close to perfection the cell is. Single-digit ERE numbers, such as the ~2% value that can be estimated for the record 26.7% PCE silicon cells 9 , 10 , are already very good, and the even higher ERE of ~22% reached by 28% PCE GaAs cells 9
suggests that photon recycling (multiple reabsorption and reconversion in free charges of photons emitted by charge recombination in the active layer) starts to contribute to both charge transport and voltage gain (Fig.
1b ). In general, high ERE values correspond to open-circuit voltages

3 , AAAS ( a ). Adapted from ref.
8 , IEEE ( b ); and ref.
13 , Wiley ( c ). Full size image The high luminescence efficiency of metal halide perovskites was recognized early on 11 . At present, the best perovskite solar cells have an ERE of 1–4% 3 , and photon recycling has been suggested to occur in these devices 12 . Another closely related indicator of loss in a solar cell is the ‘operational loss’, which is defined as the difference between the optical band gap of the absorber (in eV) and the maximum power point voltage when the cell is operating under sunlight 13 . In Fig.
1c , the operational loss is shown for a number of different PV technologies, including perovskite solar cells; PCE improvements have corresponded to marked reduction in loss for this technology. The high ERE and reduced operational loss indicate that
V oc
can reach high values in perovskite devices; however, the PCE is still lower than that of silicon solar cells with comparable ERE because other device parameters determining the PV efficiency, such as the fill factor and the short-circuit current density, are affected by resistive losses and optical losses, respectively 13 . Improving the optical design of the cells is important to move towards and beyond 25% efficiency. It is also noted that the external radiative efficiency of isolated perovskite films, here measured as the fraction of emitted to absorbed light, is as high as 70% 11 , thus there is a possibility of achieving much higher EREs in complete solar cells. Importantly, this indicates that when a perovskite absorber layer is sandwiched between charge-selective contacts in a PV device, further recombination losses are introduced. Although various methodologies — such as molecular passivation of the perovskite surface 14
or reducing the interfacial contact between the charge extraction layers and perovskite absorber 15
— have shown progress in reducing such losses, our present understanding of recombination at these heterointerfaces is limited, and there remains more than 100 mV to be gained in
V oc , by minimizing these losses. As discussed above, several optoelectronic parameters indicate that the average quality of metal halide perovskites films is already high, which is surprising considering that these are usually deposited through solution processes and have high densities of crystalline defects — this is the reason why these materials have been labelled as defect tolerant 16 , 17 . Yet, it is expected that minimization of electronic defects through materials improvements will be important to progress towards the thermodynamic efficiency limits. An important aspect relates to the chemical processes that occur when depositing perovskite films. Although the solutions used obviously contain A, B and X precursors, these ions are incorporated into many forms such as colloids, dissolved ions and complexes 18 ; and the solutions also contain additives, whose role in the chemical reactions and quality of the synthesized perovskites needs further understanding 19 . Often crystallization proceeds through an intermediate crystalline precursor phase 20 , 21 ; however, there is no consensus yet as to what are the needed ‘building blocks’ to obtain an ideal crystalline perovskite film. Beyond single-junction solar cells A more substantial efficiency boost will be obtained by moving to advanced concepts beyond single-junction PV cells. These may include multi-exciton generation, singlet fission, hot-carrier collection and even intermediate band gap cells. 22
Results suggesting that some of these processes may occur in perovskite films have been reported, although these have not yet been translated into devices with higher PCE values. A near-term means to move to higher efficiencies is to employ multi-junction concepts 22 , 23 , in which perovskite films are combined with silicon or other materials to expand the absorption spectral range (and thus the amount of solar radiation converted into electricity), and convert the solar photons into electrical potential energy at a higher voltage 24 , 25 . The success of this approach hinges upon the possibility to tune the optical bandgap of the perovskite layers, ideally from 2 eV to below 1.2 eV, depending on the absorption properties of the materials they are combined with 26 . Although bandgap tuning has been demonstrated by changing the chemical composition or leveraging quantum confinement, at present only cells with a gap in the 1.5–1.7 eV range deliver appropriately high efficiency and stability. Stability-related issues These perovskite compounds are largely held together through ionic bonding, and this is likely to be one of the factors central to both the high tolerance to crystalline defects, and the ease at which highly crystalline films can be fabricated at low temperature 27 . However, this also results in low decomposition temperatures, which make these materials intrinsically less thermally stable than silicon. The use of organic A-site cations, which can withstand much lower temperatures than the inorganic counterparts, is also an intrinsic limit; yet, such cations, being larger than any inorganic ion in the periodic table, are necessary to form a stable octahedral framework in the 3D perovskite structure 28 . A few potential routes have emerged to stabilize these frameworks with inorganic ions 29 , but more work is required to confirm if these, or other approaches, can lead to long-term stable inorganic perovskites. Aging causes electronic degradation in silicon arising from the ‘un-passivation’ of dangling bonds on the surface or at grain boundaries. For perovskites, the defect chemistry and physics is still not well understood, but the defects are thought to have energies close to, or inside, the energy bands 16 , 27 . Therefore, defects emerging during aging should be less problematic, as suggested by the high efficiency of perovskite solar cells in the presence of a relatively large fraction of PbI 2
(a degradation product) within the film 16 . Through substitution of ions and improved contact materials, the present generation of perovskite solar cells are vastly more stable, and with appropriate encapsulation they may already be close to requirements for real world deployment 2 , 4 , which are specified in the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61215 standard. However, in order to make the technology profitable, it is important to have a good level of certainty that the product will last 25 years. This requires going significantly beyond the IEC61215 standard, acquiring more detailed understanding of potential failure modes that could exist. Materials beyond the ABX 3
Pb-halide perovskites Since the advent of efficient metal halide PV cells, the prospects of discovering new related compounds has redirected new materials discovery 30 , 31 . This is also motivated by the desire to replace lead, due to toxicology concerns. Partial replacement of lead with tin is currently the only route to reduce the band gap to significantly below 1.5eV, which is essential for multi-junction cells. Although efficient tin and lead–tin PV cells have been realized 24 , the stability of the neat tin-based cells is still extremely low. Other lead-free compounds have also been tested; however, thus far they have not yet delivered PV cells with efficiencies beyond 3% 31 , 32 , 33 . This suggests that there is something extraordinarily unique about the group IV metal halide perovskites. However, it is still likely that new perovskite families do exist, but discovering them is much more challenging than first anticipated. A separate, successful case is the extension of perovskites to layered structures using larger organic cations. This has resulted in successful realization of Ruddlesden–Popper phase perovskites, and also films with mixed compositions of 2D and 3D phases. These approaches can result in both improved long-term stability and efficiency 4 , 34 . The prospect of creating stable heterojunctions between 2D and 3D phases may also enable both the study of new physics and a better control of perovskite surfaces and electronic interfaces 4 , 35 . Technology transfer in perovskite PV Although addressing the open research questions described above will help clarifying the technological potential of perovskite solar cells, there are challenges remaining towards market deployment. Considerations about the availability of materials and their environmental and toxicity risks confirm the role of perovskite PV as strong contenders for large-scale electricity generation. Start-up companies are in the process of delivering the first commercial products, yet more financial support to research and stronger interest from investors is required to overcome barriers to commercialization. Materials availability and toxicity Over the past few years, the cost of mainstream PV power generation has dropped below the cost of producing electricity from coal and gas in the sunniest locations in the world. As efficiency increases further the cost of PV electricity will continue to fall. It is therefore feasible that PV will eventually become our primary source of global power generation, which means that the volume and value of today’s PV market is only a fraction of the size it will become over the next few decades. This implies that raw resources must not limit the ambition of any PV technology to scale with this growing market. In this respect, lead-based perovskites sit in a remarkably good position. Figure
2a
shows the current annual global production capacity of elements used in existing PV technologies and perovskites 36 . In order to reach 12.5 TW PV electricity generation (the dots on the graph), GaAs PV cells would require 500 years of today’s gallium production capacity, thin film CdTe PV modules would require 1,000 years of today’s tellurium, and thin film copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) would require 400 years of today’s indium. The only commercial PV technology that can scale to this level is silicon, which for 12.5 TW PV electricity generation capacity would require around three years of our current silicon production. In stark contrast, perovskites would only take a few days of current lead production capacity to scale to the TW level.

Adapted from ref.
36 , Royal Society of Chemistry ( a ); and ref.
37 , Royal Society of Chemistry ( b ). Full size image Another critical implication of this analysis is that we would not have to significantly increase our global lead production, and hence consumption, beyond todays levels, if we moved to 100% lead-based perovskite PV power generation, thus containing the environmental impact of lead-based perovskite PV modules. Yet such impact requires more complete investigation to ensure the sustainability of this technology. As part of the activity within the European project CHEOPS, SmartGreenScans ( https://go.nature.com/2ul5Ggs ) have undertaken a rigorous life-cycle assessment (LCA) of perovskite-on-silicon tandem cell and module production using the pilot facility in Germany of Oxford Photovoltaics Ltd ( https://www.oxfordpv.com/ ) as a baseline proxy for the manufacturing process. The first results show that emitted lead contributes only 0.27% or less to the total freshwater ecotoxicity and human toxicity ( https://go.nature.com/2G5Hp3E ). The majority of the negative environmental or health impacts are related to the monocrystalline silicon production, with indium also significantly contributing. Similar LCA studies compared the total environmental impact for the manufacturing of different types of perovskite-based tandem solar cells 37 . Consistently, as shown in Fig.
2b , silicon dominates the total environmental impact, which also encourages the development of perovskite-on-perovskite tandem cells. Patent landscape and commercial activity As perovskite PV research advances, growing commercial activity is emerging. This is illustrated in a recent review of the patent literature. There are over 2,000 filed and 300 granted patents in perovskite PVs 38 . A chart of the number of patents assigned, per top assignees is shown in Fig.
3a . Of the top ten assignees of perovskite patents, six are commercial entities (a mixture of start-ups and large corporations) with the remainder being universities or research institutes. Figure

also illustrates the global nature of perovskite PV commercialization, with top assignees distributed between Europe, USA, Japan, China, Korea and Australia.

Full size image There are diverse technical directions being pursued to commercialize perovskite solar technologies, with some companies being more transparent than others. Oxford Photovoltaics Ltd is targeting perovskite-on-silicon tandem solar cells (Fig.
3b ). The rationale is that this technology capitalises upon the existing well-developed PV value chain, and through collaborating with existing silicon PV manufacturers, should enable the rapid scaling to large volume manufacturing and address the largest markets. However, there is no hiding from the key requirement to deliver 25 years stability, along with very high efficiency and high yield in manufacturing. Oxford Photovoltaics Ltd are presently scaling up towards pilot-scale manufacturing in a facility in Germany, which was previously a CIGS pilot production facility. Other companies, such as Saule Technologies ( http://sauletech.com ), and the Soliance consortium ( https://solliance.eu/ ), which includes Greatcell Solar ( www.greatcellsolar.com ) and Panasonic ( www.panasonic.com ), are developing lightweight, flexible and potentially semi-transparent perovskite modules (Fig.
3c ), for a broad range of applications including building-integrated PVs, the automotive industry and low-light indoor applications. Support for research and development Major initiatives to support perovskite PV research and development are presently lacking in ambition and scale. This may in part be due to the relatively short time passed since perovskite PV has shown such promise, and an inherent inertia and time lag in strategic investment decisions in research. Although over 3,000 academic journal publications (in 2017 alone) do suggest that many researchers are working on perovskite PVs and the related areas, the funding of this research is through a collection of small grants, rather than large ambitious multilateral projects. Some examples of the larger initiatives in Perovskite PV research include the US Office of Naval Research (ONR) Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) programmes on organic PVs ( https://go.nature.com/2GchMtG ), which have refocused much of their funding towards perovskite-based PVs, and the US SunShot initiative ( https://go.nature.com/2DVzKyC ), which funds a number of perovskite PV projects. There is also significant activity in Asia, such as the support provided by the Japanese New Energy and Industrial Technologies Development Organisation (NEDO) ( https://go.nature.com/2G9n3Xa ). In the UK, the total funding of Solar Technologies by the engineering and physical sciences research council (EPSRC) amounts to approximately £32 million (which is 0.66% of the EPSRCs portfolio), of which approximately half is related to perovskite solar cell research ( https://go.nature.com/2G5LxAy ). From the European Union, there is presently one running, and four commencing medium-scale collaborative projects focussed on perovskite PVs, which amounts to around 25 million euros, in addition to around 20 individual grants from the Marie Curie Fellowship, or European Research Council, amounting to another ten million euros. If we compare this to energy storage, in UK EPSRC provides around £110 million in funding, including the recently launched Faraday Institution, which accounts for £55 million. The storage activities are presently mainly focussing on battery storage for the automotive industry, with a £246 million commitment for the Faraday Challenge. On nuclear fusion research, the UK has committed £86 million for advancing national research ( http://www.ccfe.ac.uk/ ), and on a European scale the investment is two orders of magnitude larger, with the total ITER project ( https://www.iter.org/ ) estimated to cost in excess of 14 billion euros. In comparison to the scale of the fusion project, solar PVs, and specifically perovskites, are receiving less than 1% of the investment in research and development. However, there exists a tangible prospect for perovskite PV to contribute to the radical transformation of the US$100 billion PV industry and the multi-trillion global power industry in the near to medium term. The opportunity to capture future value from this industry — by individual countries and multinational initiatives investing in advancing research in perovskite PV — has not yet been realized. Despite the fact that real first-generation products may enter the market over the next few years, there remains the opportunity for major further innovation over the next few decades. It is also important to note that government investment into research should not only be made into pre-commercial technologies, but also into technologies that support growing industry. In Europe, research projects supporting silicon PVs are unlikely to be funded in the next rounds. However, there remain many prospects to innovate even with this well-established silicon technology; by also investing in schemes that make the environment economically favourable for commercialization, value would be pulled back to the countries that make the investment in research and development. Barriers to commercialization There are hurdles to overcome on the path to commercial success. The most significant ones are probably not technical, but relate to practicalities of business, where a key issue is raising finance. Scaling up from very promising research results to a technology ready for manufacturing requires an order of magnitude increase in investment. Many venture firms, especially from the USA, remain cautious of investing in PV technology due to the previous surge in PV investment in the mid 2000s, where the likes of MiaSole, Nanosolar and Solyndra either filed for bankruptcy or sold for a fraction of the investment that had attracted 39 . However, it is the opinion of the author that investors should be more optimistic today, as the PV industry is now in a completely different position as compared to the period between 2008 and 2012. The cost of electricity from PV is now cheaper than any other source in many places in the world, and the downward trend in cost is set to continue over the next decade. Therefore, PV is set to become a major component of global electricity generation and hence the market scale is assured. This makes strategic investment feasible; however, the largest investments in PV at present go into deployment and investment in solar farms, which have predictable rates of return, rather than investments into development of new technology where the risk is much higher. Another non-technical issue, which also affects the ability to raise investment, is how to develop an appropriate business model, which will create value from the PV industry, in the event of technical success. Existing mainstream PV manufacturers do not make a reliable profit margin; hence, new approaches to creating value, or a change in the structure of the industry, have to emerge. Outlook There has been tremendous research activity in metal halide perovskites for PV applications over the past six years, which has resulted in many discoveries and advances. Although expanding upon the lead halide material set has proven challenging, improving the quality and stability of the lead halide perovskites and devices has brought the technology tangibly close to commercial readiness. There is now growing industrial momentum and it is likely that real PV applications employing metal halide perovskites will be demonstrated over the next few years, which will represent a second phase, or era, for this research community.

Summary
Methods to simulate colloid suspension structure, dynamics, and rheology are presented and distinguished by whether the solvent is modeled by a continuum or by meso-scale particles, and whether or not a mesh is used. The unmeshed/continuum solvent methods include various forms of Stokesian Dynamics, while the meshed continuum solvent methods include the Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian method and the Immersed Boundary Method. Mesoscopic particles are used on a mesh in the Lattice–Boltzmann (LB) method and are mesh-free in Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD). These and other methods are reviewed and guidance provided on which ones are preferred in various situations. For spherical hard particles at high concentrations, without inertia, when accurate treatment of hydrodynamic interactions is needed, versions of Stokesian dynamics set benchmarks for accuracy and efficiency. Other methods become preferable depending on the speed needed for computation, the numbers of particles to be simulated, how well hydrodynamic interactions need to be modeled, whether Brownian motion or particle inertia is important, the shapes and deformability of the particles, the complexity of the flow domain, and whether the solvent is non-Newtonian. Information in this chapter indicates how well the different methods perform in their present state of development.

Introduction
Over the past three decades, methods of simulating the dynamics of suspensions have expanded enormously, to the point that there are now dozens of methods and variants thereof available, whose diversity rivals that of the problems of interest. While the proliferation of methods affords flexibility and choice, it also leads to bewilderment and uncertainty regarding the “best” method to use for a problem of interest. What counts as an “optimal” method depends on the problem of interest as well as on the desired accuracy and available computational resources. This chapter is intended to provide the reader some guidance in the choice of method, based on their limitations, and strengths and weaknesses, and to provide references that would allow the reader to dig deeper into a method of interest. The reader should be warned that improvements and expansions of existing methods, as well as entirely new methods, are constantly being developed, and so any assessment of their relative merits is open to continual update. The present review is at best a snapshot. The major features of the rheology of suspensions of hard spherical particles suspended in Newtonian media, commonly referred to as “solvents”, at low Reynolds number that one might wish to model are described in Stickel and Powell [ Reference Stickel and Powell 1 ] and throughout this book. Suspensions of particles of other shapes, flexibilities, and in the presence of inertia or viscoelastic effects, are also of interest, as are nonrheological transport and structural properties. While we will mention throughout the versatility of various methods to consider a wide range of suspension transport phenomena, to keep the content within bounds and provide a focus to this chapter, we will maintain a focus on hard sphere suspension rheology at low Reynolds number. For this problem, the rheology is controlled by two independent dimensionless groups, namely the volume fraction of spheres
ϕ ϕ , and the dimensionless shear rate, or Péclet number,
Eq. (1.7) . A schematic dependence of the dimensionless shear viscosity or relative viscosity
η r  =  η / η m η r = η / η m
on
Pe
and
ϕ ϕ
is shown in
Figure 3.1 . This figure shows the key features that one wishes to predict, quantitatively, if possible: (1) the steep, and eventually singular, increase in zero shear viscosity as volume fraction rises toward maximum random packing at around
ϕ  = 0.6 ϕ = 0.6 ; (2) the steep shear thinning for high volume fractions
ϕ  > 0.4 ϕ > 0.4
when
Pe  ≥ 0.01 Pe ≥ 0.01
or so; and (3) the shear thickening that becomes pronounced for
ϕ  > 0.4 ϕ > 0.4
when
Pe  ≥ 1 Pe ≥ 1 . Figure 3.1
Typical flow curves for the relative viscosity versus shear rate for a suspension of hard spheres.
Beyond predicting this basic behavior accurately, one would like to relate variations in this behavior from one system to another to the presence of particle charge,
grafted stabilizing layers, particle attractive or repulsive interactions, modulus and deformation of the particles, particle–particle direct contacts (i.e., lubrication breakdown), particle roughness, and other factors present in experimental systems. One would also like to be able to expand beyond hard spherical particles to soft particles, other particle shapes such as disks, rods, and ellipsoids, droplets and bubbles, biological cells, swimming micro-organisms, as well as nonrheological phenomena such as sedimentation and electrokinetics, and influences of inertia and fluid viscoelasticity. To even begin an assessment of methods of colloidal simulation, we need initially to inventory in more detail the features that a simulation method may contain, or lack. A method that excels in one application might perform dismally in another, depending on which aspects of the problem are dominant. A major reason that suspension dynamics have inspired so many disparate methods is that the problem has multiple length scales, ranging from small gaps
h
between particles, to the larger radius
R
of the particles, to the still-larger length scale
L
of a suspension fluid. For dense suspensions,
L
≫
R
≫
h , making the ratio
L / h
very large indeed. Thus, a large range of distance scales must be covered and methods are strained to model all such scales accurately, especially outside of the limits of spherical rigid particles, no inertia, etc. Hence, depending on which aspect of the problem is deemed most crucial, different methods are called for. Thus, future efforts should include development of multi-scale modeling schemes, in which methods for resolving small-scale interactions are applied to small numbers of particles (or even just two), and the results used to tune parameters and functions deployed in lower-resolution models. Such multi-scale coarse-graining schemes are now a prominent part of simulations of molecular systems. At the present time, multi-scale modeling is rare in suspension simulations, and most researchers settle for choosing a method appropriate to their application.
Well-established continuum methods for solving Navier–Stokes equations, such as Finite Difference (FD) and the Finite Element (FE) methods, when applied to suspensions, are challenged by the many fluid–solid surfaces present in suspension flow, and especially by their movement during flow or transport. Over the past 30 years, many
specialized simulation methods have been developed to cope with this issue. These can be classed into the broad categories of “continuum solvent” methods, in which the suspending medium is treated as a continuum fluid, and “particle based” in which the solvent momentum is carried by discrete particles. Among the continuum-based methods, one can take advantage of the linearity of Stokes flow and various theorems derived therefrom to determine the forces, torques, stresslets, and velocities of particles and their surfaces without ever solving explicitly for the flow of the solvent. Such methods have limitations, including greater difficulty (or even impossibility) of including inertia, and the effects of non-Newtonian media. Another option is to solve for the flow of the solvent explicitly by discretizing its velocity on a mesh, while dealing with boundaries between particles and fluid in some efficient way. The mesh enclosing the fluid can either move with the particle (a Lagrangian meshing scheme), or allow the particles to move through fixed mesh points (an Eulerian meshing scheme). An organization of many of the major methods along the lines sketched out above is given here: I.
Continuum Solvent A.
Unmeshed Solvent: Brownian Dynamics (BD), Stokesian Dynamics (SD), Accelerated Stokesian Dynamics (ASD), Fast Lubrication Dynamics (FLD), and the Boundary Element Method (BEM) B.
Meshed Solvent (aka : “Meshed Continuum Solvent (MCS) Methods”): 1.
Moving Mesh: Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) method 2.
Fixed Mesh: Distributed Lagrange Multiplier/Fictitious Domain (DLM/FD) Method, Force Coupling Method (FCM), Immersed Boundary Method (IBM), Fluid Particle Dynamics (FPD), Smoothed Profile Method (SPM) II.
Particle Solvent A.
Unmeshed: Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) B.
Meshed: Multi-Particle Collision (MPC) Dynamics, Lattice Boltzmann (LB) method Note the large number of methods above that use a continuum, meshed, solvent. For simplicity, and because the scope of this review does not permit describing each of these methods in detail, we here coin the term “Meshed Continuum Solvent” (MCS) to include all such methods. These include the Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) method, in which the mesh moves with the particle, and the fixed-mesh methods, including the Distributed Lagrange Multiplier/Fictitious Domain (DLM/FD) method, the Force Coupling Method (FCM), the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM), and the Smoothed Profile Method (SPM). Also, since Stokesian Dynamics (SD), Accelerated Stokesian Dynamics (ASD), and Fast Lubrication Dynamics (FLD) all involve setting up grand mobility or resistance tensors, using additivity of hydrodynamic interactions between particle pairs, we will collectively refer to these methods as “Stokesian particle” (SP) methods. Before describing these and other methods in more detail, we first summarize some of the key factors
that can be either essential, or unimportant, for a particular application, and, for each factor, list simulation methods that (in our view) are particularly well suited to capture it.
Details and references are given later in the discussion of each method. 1.
Large number of particles . Some methods, such as simple Brownian dynamics, can handle thousands or even nearly a million, particles, while others, such as some meshed-continuum-solvent (MCS) methods like the Smoothed Profile Method, have generally been restricted to a limited number of particles, or to two-dimensional flows. Methods that incorporate hydrodynamic interactions (HI) but can readily handle many hundreds or even thousands of particles include Fast Lubrication Dynamics (FLD), Accelerated Stokesian Dynamics (ASD), the Distributed Lagrange Multiplier/Fictitious Domain (DLM/FD) method, and the Force Coupling Method (FCM). The Particle Solvent methods, namely the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) method, Multi-Particle Collision (MPC) dynamics, Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD), and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), are more expensive, especially for refined rather than crude calculations, but have favorable linear scaling properties with increasing numbers of particles, unlike regular Stokesian Dynamics, which can be pushed to around 100 particles, but rapidly becomes unaffordable beyond that scale. 2.
Far-field hydrodynamics . Given the great expense of accounting for them, inclusion of far-field HI is avoided if possible. If one is only interested in equilibrium structures, then far-field (or even near-field) hydrodynamics is unimportant; when dynamics and kinetics is of interest, the inclusion of hydrodynamics becomes important, but must be weighed against its high cost and its importance. Methods that handle far-field hydrodynamics well include the meshed continuum solvent (MCS) methods, Stokesian Dynamics (SD), Accelerated Stokesian Dynamics (ASD), the Boundary Element Method (BEM), and the particle-solvent methods (SPH, DPD, MPC, and LB). 3.
Near-field hydrodynamics and particle contact . Near-field hydrodynamics, especially lubrication hydrodynamics, can be accounted for by relatively simple pair-wise interactions between near-neighbor particles only, and hence can be much cheaper to implement for some methods than is far-field hydrodynamics. However, near-field hydrodynamics are sensitive to gap and therefore often require very small time steps to calculate their effects accurately, increasing the expense and difficulty of introducing them, especially in dense suspensions, where the inclusion of near-field hydrodynamics is most important. Methods that describe near-field hydrodynamics well include some of the Meshed Continuum Solvent (MCS) methods especially the Smoothed Profile Method (SPM), as well as the Stokesian Particle (SP) methods. The Boundary Element Method (BEM) can also be adapted to allow closely spaced surfaces, and a number of other methods, including Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD), the Force Coupling Method (FCM), the Distributed Lagrange Multiplier/Fictitious Domain (DLM/FD) method, and the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) method have versions in which lubrication forces are included. An important special case occurs when lubrication layers are squeezed out altogether and particles come into contact and experience contact friction. These contact forces, which are
similar to those dominating granular flows, can be added to a number of the methods above, such as the Stokesian Particle (SP) methods. 4.
Brownian motion . Depending on particle size and solvent viscosity, Brownian effects may be dominant or completely unimportant. In most methods, Brownian forces can be introduced in some way, perhaps at significant expense (in the case of Stokesian dynamics or Lattice Boltzmann dynamics), while in others, such as Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD), Brownian forces are intrinsic to the method and the non-Brownian regime can only be accessed approximately for fast flows. Methods especially well suited to inclusion of Brownian forces include Brownian Dynamics (BD), particle-based-solvent methods, such as Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) and Multi-Particle Collisions (MPC) dynamics, as well as the Stokesian Particle (SP) methods. Brownian forces can be added to the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) methods. There are also methods for adding Brownian motion to Meshed Continuum-Solvent (MCS) methods, such as to the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM). 5.
Nonspherical Particle Shape . Many of the fastest suspension simulation methods are primarily intended for spherical particles. Methods that can be applied to other shapes, such as ellipsoids, disks, or more arbitrary shapes, are of increasing interest. Methods suited for this include the meshed continuum-solvent (MCS) methods, as well as the Boundary Element Method (BEM), and the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) method. Other methods typically require complex shapes to be made from composites of spheres, which then give irregular and imprecise approximations to the actual particles. Methods for which this can be done include Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD), Multi-Particle Collision (MPC) dynamics, and the Stokesian Particle (SP) methods. 6.
Flexibility of particles . Hard, nondeformable particles are normally considered in most simulations, but applications to deformable spheres, red blood cells, vesicles, and other deformable objects are of increasing interest. Methods that handle flexible particles well include the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) and the Boundary Element Method (BEM). Particle flexibility can also be modeled using composite particles in the Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) method. The Lattice Boltzmann (LB) method can also be used, when it is combined with a method that tracks deformable interfaces, such as the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM). These methods are used for studying systems discussed in
Chapters 6 – 9 . 7.
Inertial effects.
Methods designed to gain speed by taking advantage of Stokes-flow theorems, such as the Stokesian Particle (SP) methods and the Boundary Element Method (BEM) become much less usable if particle or fluid inertia becomes important. Methods that use solvent particles to transmit momentum can only approximate Stokes flow in the limit of slow flows and always contain at least some inertia, and so their parameters, including velocity, can be set to achieve a desired Reynolds number. If the particles are soft, however, as in Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD), or are ghost particles, as in Multi-Particle Collision (MPC) dynamics, artifacts due to compressibility may arise if the Reynolds number becomes too high. Methods that allow inertial effects while maintaining incompressibility include the meshed continuum-solvent (MCS) methods. 8.
Non-Newtonian solvent . There is considerable interest in the behavior and rheology of suspensions in non-Newtonian fluids, including viscoelastic ones. Usually, inclusion of non-Newtonian solvent requires use of a method that solves for the flow in the solvent phase explicitly, and therefore includes the Meshed Continuum Solvent (MCS) methods. The Lattice Boltzmann (LB) method can also be adapted to allow inclusion of special cases of non-Newtonian solvents. 9.
Flow domain . The flow domain significantly affects the choice of method. Some methods, such as the Stokesian Particle (SP) methods, work well mostly in a quasi-infinite system with periodic boundary conditions, or in simple geometries, such as slits or tubes. Other methods, including the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) method, are more easily adapted to complex domains with complex surfaces. Generally, grid-based methods, such as the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) method and Multi-Particle Collision (MPC) Dynamics, are fine for straight boundaries or ones with right angles, but have more difficulty with curved geometries, which have to be approximated using stepped profiles. Off-lattice solvent particle methods, such as Brownian Dynamics (BD), Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD), and Stokesian Particle (SP) methods can handle complex curved geometries better, by use of wall particles. For Stokesian Dynamics, where computer time scales with total number of particles as
N 3 , the wall particles add great expense. Other methods that handle complex boundaries well are the Boundary Element Method (BEM) and the Meshed Continuum Solvent (MCS) methods. We now describe the various methods in more detail, providing references to the source material. 3.2
Continuum Solvent Methods – Unmeshed Solvent
3.2.1
Brownian
or Langevin Dynamics
The simplest and fastest method of simulating colloidal dynamics and rheology is simple Brownian dynamics, originating from the work of Ermak and McCammon [ Reference Ermak and McCammon 2 ]. In the absence of hydrodynamic interactions among the particles, the motion of a particle in a structureless, viscous Newtonian solvent, modeled as a continuum fluid with constant viscosity, is described by a simple stochastic differential equation: r ̇ i t = v r i + D 0 k B T F i t + ξ i t , (3.1) where
r i t
is the position vector of bead
i ,
F i t
is the total force on the particle (exerted by other particles and external fields),
v r i
is the solvent velocity at the position of the bead, and
ξ i ( t ) ξ i t
a random force satisfying
< X i t X i t ≥ 2 D 0 δ t I , where
D 0
is the particle’s diffusivity,
δ ( t ) δ t
is the Kronecker delta function, and
I I
is the unit tensor.
Eq. (3.1)
omits hydrodynamic interaction (HI). Note that the inertial term proportional to
r ¨ i t
is missing from
Eq. (3.1) , implying a noninertial integration. Even when inertia is unimportant, it is sometimes numerically helpful to include the inertial term, in which case the simulation method is sometimes called
Langevin dynamics . To prevent particle overlap during the simulations the force
F i t
can contain a steep repulsive term, but for hard particles this necessitates using tiny time steps to allow the steeply increasing repulsion to push colliding particles apart before they overlap significantly. Strating [ Reference Strating 3 ] avoided this by using the
elastic collision method , in which the time and position of particle collisions are updated based on constant velocities between elastic collisions. A closely related method was proposed earlier by Heyes and Melrose [ Reference Heyes and Melrose 4 ]. This method allows for correct determination of particle–particle pair distribution functions at equilibrium. Under shearing flow, because of its neglect of HI, the prediction of the shear viscosity with this method fails at intermediate and high shear rates, and also fails in the low shear limit at small and moderate volume fractions, as illustrated in
Figures 3.2
and
3.3 . Note in
Figure 3.3
that the BD simulations without HI under-predict the data at lower volume fractions but over-predict at higher particle concentrations. The same can be seen in
Figure 3.2 , which
also shows that the simulations exaggerate the shear thinning and show an additional drop in viscosity at high concentrations and high shear rates. This is due to particles lining up into “strings” in the flow direction, a result that is likely sensitive to the finite box size as well as to HI. The Strating model does not show shear thickening (as depicted in
Figure 3.1 ) at high rates, due to lack of HI. Figure 3.2
Steady state shear viscosity as a function of the Péclet number, here defined as
Pe = γ ̇ a 2 / D 0
where
a a
is the particle radius and
D 0
the particle diffusion coefficient of an isolated sphere, for various volume fractions given, from elastic-collision BD simulations of Strating for more than 1,000 particles. Data of Van der Werff and de Kruif [ Reference Van der Werff and de Kruif 5 ] for silica particles in cyclohexane are plotted for volume fractions of 0.419 (dashed line) and 0.538 (dash-dotted line). The viscosity drop at high volume fraction and high
Pe
results from a transition to hexagonally ordered strings in the direction of the flow.

1999;59(2):2175–2187 [ Reference Strating 3 ] by the American Physical Society, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevE.59.2175 While the Brownian Dynamics method without HI does not adequately describe transport properties of suspensions, especially at high volume fractions, the model is perfectly adequate for equilibrium properties, for which transport rates are irrelevant and only the energetic interparticle interactions matter. In these cases, the speed of the method and ability to equilibrate quickly and for large numbers of particles is attractive, although of course other methods, such as Metropolis sampling, can also deliver thermodynamic properties. Nevertheless, BD methods have been used to determine phase diagrams of colloids with attractive interactions, and to give at least a qualitative picture of nonequilibrium dynamics, such as colloidal gelation [ Reference Foffi, De Michele, Sciortino and Tartaglia 6 ]. The speed of the BD method has allowed it recently to be used to examine in detail the coarsening dynamics of some 750,000 attractive spheres, albeit without HI [ Reference Zia, Landrum and Russel 7 ]. 3.2.2
Stokesian Particle (SP) Methods
Stokesian Dynamics
(SD)
The key feature missing from the above simulations is hydrodynamic interaction (HI). One of the first, and still most popular, methods for dealing realistically with HI (both near- and far-field), is the “Stokesian Dynamics” method presented first by Durlofsky et al. [ Reference Durlofsky, Brady and Bossis 8 ] and used frequently since for problems of rheology at low Reynolds number [ Reference Sierou and Brady 9 – Reference Wagner and Brady 11 ], sedimentation [ Reference Swan, Brady and Moore 12 , Reference Kopp and Hofling 13 ], colloidal aggregation [ Reference Cao, Cummins and Morris 14 ], electrophoresis [ Reference Drews, Cartier and Bishop 15 ], swimming of microparticles [ Reference Swan, Brady and Moore 12 ], and many others. The method combines both near- and far-field hydrodynamics, where the far-field hydrodynamics accounts for many body effects out to high order, and so provides an accurate, though not completely rigorous, method for describing dynamics, rheology, and transport properties of dense suspensions of dense spherical particles at a vanishingly small Reynolds number. The method exploits the multipole expansion in inverse separation (i.e., in powers of 1/ r ) for force and torque (or linear and rotational velocity) of two spheres in the Stokes-flow limit. The various terms in this expansion had been developed over many years, culminating in the tabulations of the various matrix elements by Jeffrey and Onishi [ Reference Jeffrey and Onishi 16 ] and by Kim and Karrila [ Reference Kim and Karrila 17 ]), with some corrections summarized in the appendix of Mohammadi et al. [ Reference Mohammadi, Larson, Liu and Larson 18 ]. The multipole expansion fails for particles in near contact (since it is an expansion in 1/ r ), but near-field lubrication terms were also developed, and Jeffrey and Onishi provided a means of combining both near- and far-field terms to produce an accurate method of describing hydrodynamic interactions between two spheres at any separation. In the form presented by Jeffrey and Onishi, however, the method only permitted the description of two-sphere problems. The extension to many spheres is the triumph of the Stokesian dynamics methods, which accomplishes this by adding pairwise the effects on the
mobility
of a given particle induced by forces on each particle, and then inverting the resulting grand mobility matrix
for interactions of all particles to produce a grand resistance matrix to which pairwise lubrication forces are added. The summation of the pairwise mobility matrices itself does not contain multi-body effects; that is, the effects on the hydrodynamic interactions between a pair of spheres by other surrounding spheres is not included in the pairwise summation that yields the grand mobility matrix. Yet, amazingly, once the matrix is inverted into the grand resistance matrix, these many-body effects are captured, at least for the lower third-to-fifth order multipoles in the expansion [ Reference Durlofsky, Brady and Bossis 8 , Reference Weinbaum, Ganatos and Yan 19 ]. The Stokesian Dynamics method is summarized briefly by Foss and Brady [ Reference Foss and Brady 20 ]; in a nutshell, both the diffusivity and random force term in
Eq. (3.1)
must be replaced by matrix-multiplied terms to account for the hydrodynamic interactions. An early assessment of multipole moment expansion methods and their accuracy and cost is provided by Ladd [ Reference Ladd 21 ]. While Stokesian Dynamics is much more accurate than simpler methods, the required matrix manipulations are expensive; the computational cost scales as the third power ( N 3 ) of the number of particles [ Reference Foss and Brady 20 ], limiting the original method to simulation of only a few hundred particles or so. However, centrosymmetric interparticle forces are readily included, as well as torques that might be generated
when noncentrosymmetric forces (such as axisymmetric forces) are present. Brownian motion can be included as well, with added expense. As SD simulations are based on analytical hydrodynamic interaction tensors valid for Stokes flow, flow domain boundaries require either the use of modified interaction tensors that account for the boundaries, or the use of boundary particles to account for momentum transfer to or from walls. The need to add wall particles increases the expense of the method. Periodic geometries can be handled by using a particle mesh Ewald scheme to sum hydrodynamic influences over periodic images. The results are satisfying:
Figure 2.8
shows the predicted curve of shear viscosity versus Péclet number, which not only gives a result in agreement with experiments (as exemplified by the schematic in
Figure 3.1 ), but shows the origins of the shear thinning and thickening phenomena in the Brownian and hydrodynamic contributions, respectively, to the stress. Note in
Figure 3.2
the failure of simple Brownian Dynamics (without HI) to capture the shear thickening is obviously a result of the absence of the hydrodynamic interactions.
Accelerated Stokesian Dynamics
(ASD)
The great expense of Stokesian dynamics and its rapid decline in efficiency with increasing numbers of particles (notice the small number of particles used to obtain the data in
Figure 2.8 ) motivated the development of accelerated Stokesian dynamics (ASD) [ Reference Sierou and Brady 9 , Reference Banchio and Brady 22 ]. ASD removes the most costly step for large numbers of particles
N , which is the computation and inversion of the far-field grand mobility or resistance matrices, which include interactions between every pair of particles in the simulation. ASD avoids this expense by taking advantage of the fact that the far-field hydrodynamic force (and not the elements of the matrix itself) suffices for the
iterative
calculation of the particle velocities, rather than using the expensive direct inversion. Hence, using a particle-mesh approach [ Reference Hockney and Eastwood 23 ], an Ewald-summed wave-space contribution is calculated as a Fourier transform sum, and the iterative inversion can then be calculated at order O( N
ln
N ) rather than O( N 3 ) as in regular SD. The usual near-field lubrication forces are added again, as in the regular SD technique. For the sedimentation velocity in a model problem of a simple cubic array of spheres, which has an exact solution due to Zick and Homsy [ Reference Zick and Homsy 24 ], the ASD method appears to be just as accurate as SD, although both begin to deviate from the exact solution as particle density becomes high. A related acceleration technique, the Spectral Ewald Accelerated Stokesian Dynamics (SEASD) method was recently proposed by Wang and Brady [ Reference Wang and Brady 25 ]; it becomes more efficient than regular Stokesian dynamics when the number of particles exceeds around 300, and can be sped up another factor of 10 by using GPU processors. Various versions of it include speeded-up methods for handling Brownian motion using a mean-field approximation. An extension of Stokesian dynamics to nonspherical particles is possible through treating nonspherical particles as aggregates of spherical particles [ Reference Kutteh 26 ], at the cost of much greater expense, especially when the nonaccelerated SD is used with its
N 3
scaling of simulation time with the number of spherical subparticles.
Fast Lubrication Dynamics
(FLD)
Ball and Melrose [ Reference Ball and Melrose 27 ] noted that, for dense suspensions, near-field lubrication hydrodynamics becomes more important than far-field hydrodynamics at least in shear flows. Moreover, lubrication hydrodynamics is limited to pairs of neighboring particles, while far-field HI requires summing over all pair interactions between each sphere and every other sphere. Thus, a great savings in cost is achieved if the far-field interactions are neglected, while retaining the near-field lubrication hydrodynamics. This “pair-drag” approximation is able to predict qualitatively the shear-dependent viscosity of spheres in dense suspensions. Kumar and Higdon [ Reference Kumar and Higdon 28 , Reference Kumar and Higdon 29 ] suggested an improvement, called Fast Lubrication Dynamics, in which, rather than ignoring completely the far-field hydrodynamics as the “pair-drag” model does, instead replaces them by an isotropic far-field resistance tensor, resembling an “effective viscosity” calculation by Beenakker [ Reference Beenakker 30 ]. The resistances in this isotropic tensor to translation, rotation, and to velocity gradients are obtained from short-time diffusion and viscosity coefficients from full Stokesian dynamics simulations [ Reference Bolintineanu, Grest, Lechman, Pierce, Plimpton and Schunk 31 ]. The far-field tensor in this method is thus independent of time-dependent or shear-dependent suspension structure. The short-range pair-wise lubrication resistance matrix is retained and carries a strong dependence on suspension structure. An open-source FLD code exists within the LAMMPS software suite. The zero shear viscosity for FLD matches that of full Stokesian Dynamics for particle concentrations less than 40%, and falls below SD results by about 20% when the concentration reaches 50% [ Reference Bybee 32 ]. Bolintineanu et al. [ Reference Bolintineanu, Grest, Lechman, Pierce, Plimpton and Schunk 31 ] carefully compared FLD with both Dissipative Particle Dynamics
(DPD) and Multi-Particle Collision
(MPC) dynamics simulations for dense suspensions, using LAMMPS codes for each of these methods. They concluded that, when the equations are integrated “inertially”, that is with the acceleration term included for the colloids (the solvent is Stokesian of course, and responds instantly to changes in colloidal forces), the FLD method yields late-time diffusion coefficients in excellent agreement with those from the more rigorous Stokesian dynamics method, while significant deficiencies emerge for both DPD and MPC dynamics. It is also much easier to obtain simulation input parameters from physical parameters for the FLD method than for DPD or MPC. However, given that the far-field isotropic resistance in FLD was tuned to capture equilibrium suspension properties, the largest deviations in FLD might well occur under strong flows that distort both near- and far-field suspension structure away from equilibrium. A comparison of the predictions of FLD with Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) and Multi-Particle Collision (MPC) dynamics (also known as Stochastic Rotation Dynamics, or SRD), using LAMMPS algorithms, can be found in Schunk et al. [ Reference Schunk, Pierce, Lechman, Grillet, Veld and Weiss 33 ]. Following prescient work by Melrose and Ball [ Reference Melrose and Ball 34 ], it has been increasingly recognized in recent years that in dense suspensions lubrication layers will at moderate stress be squeezed down to thicknesses comparable to particle roughness or even molecular dimensions, leading to “lubrication breakdown”, including direct contacts between particle surfaces with frictional contact forces. A “minimal” model that includes such forces is that of Seto and colleagues [ Reference Seto, Mari, Morris and Denn 35 , Reference Mari, Seto, Morris and Denn 36 ], who modified the “pair-drag” model of Melrose and Ball [ Reference Melrose and Ball 34 ] to include static and sliding frictional forces that
occur upon attainment of a critical normal force pressing the two particles together. This model, while phenomenological, is able to predict the discontinuous shear thickening that is observed in many dense colloids, but is not predicted by models containing only traditional lubrication forces in the near field; see
Figure 3.4 . The area is currently of great interest and controversy, and since these contact forces arise as solvent is squeezed to the molecular level, the phenomenon illustrates well the challenge in suspension dynamics of handling length scales spanning literally from atomic to continuum. Simulation methods, or combinations of them, that can realistically encompass such a range are needed, and should inspire much imaginative and exciting work in the coming years, work that is likely to have wide application in many areas outside of suspension rheology, such as tribology, printing, and others.

Boundary Element Analysis
The Boundary Element Method
(BEM) (or Boundary Integral Method) uses the linearity of the Stokes equations (at zero Reynolds number) to determine a Green’s function that allows derivation of integral equations from which forces and velocities on surfaces can be obtained, without the need to determine velocities in the bulk fluid (although these can be computed afterward by post-processing boundary data) [ Reference Youngren and Acrivos 37 ]. Linearity is similarly used in Stokesian Dynamics (SD) to avoid solving explicitly for the flow. However SD also takes advantage of explicit formulas available for hydrodynamic interactions (multipole expansions for the far field and lubrication formulas for the near field) between pairs of spheres. BEM uses only the point-force limit of these formulas, but integrates this point force over particle surfaces that can be of complex and/or flexible shap e. Such shapes include capsules [ Reference Ramanujan and Pozrikidis 38 , Reference Lac, Morel and Barthes-Biesel 39 ], biological cells [ Reference Pozrikidis 40 ], and swimming micro-organisms [ Reference Ishikawa, Simmonds and Pedley 41 ]. While the BEM
can be more efficient than solving the flow field in the bulk fluid, especially for three dimensional flows, it is still computationally demanding, and often limited to just one or two such particles, although Zhao et al. [ Reference Zhao, Shaqfeh and Narsimhan 42 ] simulated around 50 red blood cells in a capillary, but with equal viscosity for fluid inside and outside of the membrane to reduce costs. BEM can be used to obtain pairwise interaction matrices for particles of complex but rigid shape, which are then used to solve many-particle problems in periodic geometries, albeit in semi-dilute conditions where two-body interactions dominate. Such an approach has been used for example for swimming micro-organisms by Ishikawa and Pedley [ Reference Ishikawa and Pedley 43 ]. Further, Brownian forces were included in a “fluctuating boundary element” method [ Reference Bao, Rachh, Keaveny, Greengard and Donev 44 ]. Finally, Swan and Wang [ Reference Swan and Wang 45 ] developed a fast method to compute transport particles of complex shape. It resembles Stokesian Dynamics in that it uses resistance matrices to compute forces and velocities of spherical particles, but resembles the Boundary Element Method in that the resistance matrices are based on the low order Rotne–Prager tensor and the spherical particles are used as points to outline the shape of nonspherical particles. It gains speed and favorable scaling with system size through the use of GPU implementation of Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) summation of long-range interactions. Its intended use includes the hydrodynamics of complex particles such as proteins. 3.3
Continuum Solvent Methods –
Meshed Solvent
Our review of these methods will be very brief, but a more detailed review has been published recently by Maxey and Patel [ Reference Maxey and Patel 46 ] of these and other methods to which interested readers are referred. 3.3.1
Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian
Method (ALE)
This method uses a Lagrangian moving mesh, and is a versatile technique for carrying out finite element analysis in problems with moving surfaces. It has been applied to suspension-flow problems, especially by Hu [ Reference Hu 47 ] and Hu et al. [ Reference Hu, Patankar and Zhu 48 ], and others since then. As an indication of its versatility, it has been applied to the 2D simulation of the migration of a particle in Poiseuille flow of a viscoelastic fluid at finite Reynolds number [ Reference Trofa, Vocciante, D’Avino, Hulsen, Greco and Maffettone 49 ] and in a viscoelastic Couette flow [ Reference Choi, Hulsen and Meijer 50 ]. Methods that allow the particles to move through a fixed mesh include the Force Coupling Method (FCM), the Distributed Lagrange Multiplier/Fictitious Mesh (DLM/FM) method, the Immersed Boundary Method (ICM), the Fluid Particle Dynamics (FPD) method, and the Smoothed Profile Method (SPM). A brief summary of most of these methods can be found in Luo et al. [ Reference Luo, Maxey and Karniadakis 51 ]; an even briefer summary follows here.
Force Coupling Method
(FCM)
The FCM [ Reference Maxey and Patel 46 , Reference Lomholt and Maxey 52 – Reference Liu, Maxey and Karniadakis 54 ] avoids applying no-slip boundary conditions directly, but instead represents each particle in the flow by a low-order expansion of force
multipoles. This is then applied as a distributed body force on the flow field, gridded on a lattice. It captures the far-field solution accurately and can typically resolve body forces well but does not fully resolve the flow field close to the particle surfaces. The lack of resolution in this method is compensated by its relative speed, with the cost scaling as
O ( N ln( N ) [ Reference Yeo and Maxey 55 ]; simulations of sedimentation of up to 10,000 particles have been carried out with the FCM [ Reference Dance and Maxey 56 ]. In addition, lubrication forces have been added to the FCM method [ Reference Yeo and Maxey 55 ], while retaining its favorable scaling, and allowing 1,000 particles to be simulated. The viscosity versus particle concentration thereby obtained is similar to that of the most accurate methods; see
Figure 3.5 . Figure 3.5

Distributed Lagrange Multiplier/Fictitious Domain
(DLM/FD)
In this method, particles are constrained to rigid-body motion by the use of a well-chosen field of Lagrange multipliers [ Reference Glowinski, Pan, Hesla and Joseph 60 – Reference Patankar, Singh, Joseph, Glowinski and Pan 62 ]. Lubrication forces have recently been added to the method to permit accurate near-field hydrodynamics, and the method was recently applied to the simulation of 10,000 sedimenting particles [ Reference Gallier, Lemaire, Lobry and Peters 63 ]. The DLM/FD method has also been adapted to simulating suspensions in viscoelastic (Oldroyd-B) fluids [ Reference Hao, Pan, Glowinski and Joseph 64 ], and to particles that collide [ Reference Wachs 65 ]. By combining DLM/FD with the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) method, fluid interactions with elastic solids can be simulated without remeshing [ Reference Shi and Phan-Thien 66 ].
Immersed Boundary Method
(IMB)
For this method [ Reference Peskin 67 , Reference Peskin 68 ], the fluid–solid boundary moves with the local fluid velocity, and in return exerts a force on the fluid. In the original version, this force is obtained from the elastic properties of the immersed boundary, but the method has been extended to flows with rigid bodies [ Reference Fogelson and Peskin 69 , Reference Beyer and Leveque 70 ]. Brownian motion has been included in the IMB method using the method of fluctuating hydrodynamics [ Reference Delong, Usabiaga, Delgado-Buscalioni, Griffith and Donev 71 ], where the thermal fluctuations are directly incorporated in the governing fluid equations [ Reference Landau and Lifshit︠s︡ 72 ]. A similar approach was used to incorporate Brownian dynamics into the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) method [ Reference Ladd, Gang, Zhu and Weitz 73 ]. The IBM is very widely used in the mechanical engineering community, especially for particle-containing flows with strong turbulence [ Reference Vowinckel, Kempe and Frohlich 74 ], including gas/solid suspensions such as fluidized beds, and including heat transfer effects [ Reference Feng and Musong 75 ]. It is also often combined with the Lattice Boltzmann method for solving momentum transfer while tracking particle surfaces [ Reference Zhou and Fan 76 ], including soft particles [ Reference Kruger, Kaoui and Harting 77 ]. The IBM and its applications were reviewed by Deen et al. [ Reference Deen, Peters, Padding and Kuipers 78 ].
Fluid Particle Dynamics
(FPD)
In this method, Tanaka and Araki [ Reference Tanaka and Araki 79 ] treat the particle as a fluid with very high viscosity, thereby removing the fluid–solid boundaries, rendering the entire domain (including the solids) a “fluid” with inhomogeneous viscosity, making it essentially a hydrodynamic phase-field model [ Reference Marth, Aland and Voigt 80 ]. The method was used to simulate colloidal aggregation in a liquid crystal [ Reference Araki and Tanaka 81 ], and recently for a collection of dumbbell swimmers [ Reference Furukawa, Marenduzzo and Cates 82 ].
Smoothed Profile Method
(SPM)
This method [ Reference Nakayama and Yamamoto 83 , Reference Nakayama, Kim and Yamamoto 84 ] uses a fixed computational mesh that is not shaped to the geometry of the particles. Instead, the particle surfaces are replaced smoothed-out density profiles and used to construct a body force term that is added into the Navier–Stokes equations. The accuracy of the method has been validated for flow around a single particle, a single rigid chain, and two colliding particles [ Reference Molina, Otomura, Shiba, Kobayashi, Sano and Yamamoto 85 ]. The method has also been applied to two-dimensional problems with many particles (2D disks) [ Reference Nakayama and Yamamoto 83 ]. As a general comment, fluctuating forces; i.e., Brownian forces, can be introduced into continuum solvent in Eulerian finite volume schemes [ Reference Sharma and Patankar 86 ], similar to what is done in Lattice Boltzmann simulations by Ladd and coworkers [ Reference Ladd 87 , Reference Ladd and Verberg 88 ]. 3.4
Particle Solvent Methods

3.4.1
Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
(SPH)
The Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method introduced by Monaghan [ Reference Monaghan 89 , Reference Monaghan 90 ], and reviewed by Liu et al. [ Reference Liu, Maxey and Karniadakis 54 ], Hoover [ Reference Hoover 91 ], and Li and Liu [ Reference Li and Liu 92 ], is a mesh-free method that discretizes the Navier–Stokes equation by treating both colloids and fluid as “particles” with smoothed density distribution whose interactions
generate accelerations that produce both pressure gradients and viscous damping functions. The key step in the method is to assign a velocity to boundary particles that ensures that the no-slip velocity is imposed on the surface of the prescribed boundary; see
Figure 3.6 . This establishes better control over the boundary condition of a suspended object than is possible with some other particle-based methods. Inclusion of near-field lubrication generally requires explicit inclusion of analytical forms for lubrication forces [ Reference Bian, Litvinov, Qian, Ellero and Adams 93 ], and this has been applied with success to the prediction of the zero shear viscosity of dense hard sphere suspensions [ Reference Vazquez-Quesada, Bian and Ellero 94 ]. A review of the method can be found in Harting et al. [ Reference Harting, Frijters, Ramaioli, Robinson, Wolf and Luding 95 ] along with a comparison to Lattice Boltzmann dynamics and some example problems involving sedimentation. While the original method does not include Brownian motion, in an extension of it called “Smoothed Dissipative Particle Dynamics”
(SDPD) the SPH method is modified to allow fluctuating hydrodynamics [ Reference Español and Revenga 96 ], in a manner consistent with the Landau–Lifshitz theory for fluctuating hydrodynamics [ Reference Landau and Lifshit︠s︡ 72 ]. The method then bears similarity to Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD), but with a more careful control of the solid-liquid boundary, extendible to nonspherical particles without needing to compose them of aggregated spheres. A number of problems involving one or two rotating spheres, and a sphere interacting with a wall or interacting with another sphere hydrodynamically, were solved accurately by SDPD [ Reference Bian, Litvinov, Qian, Ellero and Adams 93 ]. The method requires an interaction cut-off radius
r c
that is 2–4 times longer than required by DPD, with a consequent increase in cost, but with more accurate solution. Recent simulations with this method were able to solve up to 1,000 or so non-Brownian 2D disks at high concentration with the inclusion of short-range repulsive forces between particles, allowing simulation of shear thickening [ Reference Bian, Litvinov, Ellero and Wagner 97 ].

Journal of Non-Newtonian Fluid Mechanics
2014;213:39–49 [ Reference Bian, Litvinov, Ellero and Wagner 97 ] In addition to Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics, other methods of using non-Brownian particles to replace continuum solvent include the element-free Galerkin method (EFGM) [ Reference Belytschko, Lu and Gu 98 ], the reproducing kernel particle method (RKPM) [ Reference Liu, Jun and Zhang 99 ], and the finite point method (FPM) [ Reference Onate, Idelsohn, Zienkiewicz and Taylor 100 ]. Since these methods have not as of this writing been applied to the study of colloidal suspensions [ Reference Bolintineanu, Grest, Lechman, Pierce, Plimpton and Schunk 31 ], we consider them no further here. 3.4.2
Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD)
Dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) [ Reference Hoogerbrugge and Koelman 101 – Reference Groot and Warren 103 ] was developed as a mesoscopic particle simulation method that uses
soft
conservative repulsive forces to regulate relative interactions among the components and dissipative and random thermal forces to control the friction. The method allows larger time steps than is possible with atomistically realistic interactions. The restriction of conservative forces to purely repulsive forms is workable for condensed liquid phases, where volume changes on mixing are small, and fluid structure is controlled by
relative
interactions among the species. Thus a
relative attraction
between two species can be created by making their interaction
less repulsive
than that of other interactions. The basic equations of the DPD method are: d r i d t = v i , m i d v i d t = F i , (3.2) where
r i ,
m i , and
v i
are the position, mass, and velocity of the
i th particle; and
F i
is the total force experienced by the
i th particle. The total force acting on the
i th particle by all other particles (j) is given by F i = ∑ j ≠ i F ij C + F ij D + F ij R , (3.3) where
F ij C ,
F ij D , and
F ij R
represent the conservative, dissipative, and random forces, respectively. These pairwise additive forces are given as: F ij C = a ij w r ij r ̂ ij (3.4) F ij D = − γ w D r ij r ̂ ij ⋅ v ij r ̂ ij (3.5) F ij R = σ w R r ij θ ij Δ t − 1 / 2 r ̂ ij (3.6) where
r ij = r i − r j , r ̂ ij = r ij / r ij , v ij = v i − v j , Δ t
is the timestep,
a ij a ij
is the repulsion parameter between beads
i
and
j , γ is the friction coefficient, σ is noise amplitude,
w D ( r ) and
w R ( r ) are dimensionless weight functions for the dissipative and random processes, and
θ ij  =  θ ji θ ij = θ ji
is a white-noise Gaussian random variable:
< θ ij ( t ) >  = 0 < θ ij t > = 0
and
< θ ij ( t ) θ kl ( t ') >  = ( δ ik δ jl  +  δ il δ jk ) δ ( t  −  t ') < θ ij t θ kl t ' > = δ ik δ jl + δ il δ jk δ t − t ' . The fluctuation-dissipation theorem requires that
w D ( r )
=
[ w R ( r )] 2
and
σ 2  = 2 γk B T σ 2 = 2 γ k B T . A common choice for weight function of the conservative force is the soft interaction given by: w r = 1 ‐ r / r c r ≤ r c 0 r > r c . (3.7) A similar weight function is often used for the random force
w R ( r ). Since the solvent is composed of particles that exchange momentum through both the conservative and dissipative forces, DPD allows hydrodynamics to be captured for arbitrary spatial distributions of particles and arbitrary boundaries. The soft potentials and dissipative forces make no attempt at molecular realism, but allow mass and
momentum transfer to occur with time steps that are much larger than those in molecular dynamics, with a consequent speed-up in simulation. A key aspect of the dissipative force is that it conserves linear momentum, and so preserves hydrodynamic interactions. The dissipative force does not conserve mechanical energy, however, and the energy lost is replaced by the random force, for which momentum is conserved pair-by-pair. Especially given that publically available DPD codes are available, such as in the LAMMPS suite, DPD has become a versatile way of solving many problems in soft-matter thermodynamics and transport, involving polymers, surfactants, colloids, biological materials, and more [ Reference Liu, Liu, Zhou and Chang 104 ]. The computational cost of DPD scales simply linearly with the number of DPD particles,
O ( N ). Colloidal particles can be simulated in DPD by lumping hundreds of small DPD particles into each larger, rigid, colloid [ Reference Koelman and Hoogerbrugge 105 ].
Because the method relies on collisions of DPD particles to transfer momentum, the speed of momentum transfer within the fluid is finite, and hence the Stokes-flow limit cannot be attained, although it can be approached by decreasing the dimensionless velocity, with a consequent increase in cost. The softness of the particle interactions also makes the fluid somewhat compressible. Thus both the Mach number
Ma
=
U / U s , where
U s U s
is the speed of sound, and the Reynolds number
Re =  ρUL / η m Re = ρ UL / η m
are nonzero, and if their values are not made small enough, results of DPD simulations can show spurious effects. The softness of the potential also leads to rather slow momentum transfer relative to mass transfer, leading to values of the Schmidt number
Sc  =  η m / ρD Sc = η m / ρD , i.e. the ratio of these two rates, to be artificially low, unless countermeasures are taken [ Reference Mai-Duy, Pan, Phan-Thien and Khoo 106 ]. The use of particles with a thermostat regulating their velocities means that DPD particles are Brownian, so that the fluid bead Péclet number ( Pe f ) is finite, and fluctuations in stress must be averaged out, making the method less suitable for problems where Brownian forces are negligible. The colloid particle Péclet number
Pe
in DPD simulations is the DPD fluid particle Péclet number
Pe f
times the ratio of the diffusivity of the colloidal particle to the diffusivity of the DPD fluid particle [ Reference Huang, Marson and Larson 107 ]. These sources of possible error can be assessed from the following formulas [ Reference Español and Warren 102 ]: Ma = U k B T / m + λ a ii nr c 4 / m ; Re = mnUL η ; Sc = η mnD ; Pe f = UL D = Re ⋅ Sc , (3.8) where
m
is the mass of the DPD particle,
n
is the number of particles per unit volume,
λ λ
is a numerical constant typically equal to
π /15, π / 15 ,
r c
is the range of the repulsive potential,
a ii
is a typical bead–bead repulsion parameter,
η η
the fluid viscosity,
D
the DPD fluid particle diffusivity, and
U
and
L
are the characteristic velocity and length scale of the flow. Formulas for
η η
and
D
can be obtained in Marsh et al. [ Reference Marsh, Backx and Ernst 108 ]. A key challenge in DPD simulations is that one cannot control directly the dimensionless groups above ( Ma ,
Re ,
Sc ,
Pe f ), but only indirectly through choice of DPD parameters ( m ,
k B T ,
n ,
a ii ). In particular, the final expression in
Eq. (3.7)
implies that non-Brownian ( Pe f
≫1), noninertial ( Re <  < 1 Re ≪ 1 ) flows require very large Schmidt
numbers
Sc . As mentioned, there are means of achieving high
Sc
through creating very strong dissipative interactions between DPD beads, but these lead to poor resolution of flows in thin boundary layers [ Reference Huang, Marson and Larson 107 ]. On the other hand, if high
Re
is desired, the Mach number
Ma
rises with it, eventually destroying the accuracy of the flow through artificial compressibility of the fluid. For example, this generally puts turbulent flow with DPD out of reach. The DPD method is thus “mesoscopic” not only in using fluid particles or mesoscopic size, but also in the sense that all dimensionless groups are of intermediate value, often neither vanishingly small nor asymptotically high. This makes it essential to control DPD parameters carefully so that the dimensionless groups one wishes to be asymptotically small or large, be “small or large enough” to give acceptably accurate results. Additionally, integration of the DPD equations must be done carefully to avoid either inaccuracies on the one hand, or excessively small time steps on the other. A brief review of methods can be found in Mai-Duy et al. [ Reference Mai-Duy, Pan, Phan-Thien and Khoo 106 ]. An alternative version of DPD is the Fluid Particle Model
(FPM) (not to be confused with Fluid Particle Dynamics (FPD), in which the solvent is a continuum) introduced by Español and Revenga [ Reference Español and Revenga 96 ], and its modification by Pan et al. [ Reference Pan, Caswell and Karniadakis 109 ]. This method uses a large DPD particle for each colloidal sphere, rather than an aggregate of DPD solvent particles, and includes a noncentrosymmetric dissipative force between colloidal particles or between solvent and colloidal particle as well as including particle torques. The conservative force is made relatively hard for the sphere–sphere interactions. The result is a rather successful prediction of zero shear viscosity versus particle concentration, as shown in
Figure 3.7
[ Reference Pan, Caswell and Karniadakis 109 ]. Since the solvent must carry hydrodynamic information from each colloidal particle, there must be many (around 200 solvent particles per colloid particle), and thus DPD simulations with hundreds of colloid particles require tens of thousands of DPD solvent particles to simulate a dense suspension. Nevertheless, Pan et al. [ Reference Pan, Caswell and Karniadakis 109 ] estimate that DPD simulations of colloidal suspension are around three orders of magnitude faster than accelerated Stokesian Dynamics (ASD). While regular DPD seems to give viscosities and normal stress differences roughly consistent with SD simulations, precise comparisons of these methods and clear benchmarks to establish the relative accuracy and speed of these methods do not seem to have been developed yet. Also, standard DPD suspension simulations do not seem able to yield the shear thickening regime as they do not resolve thin lubricating layers. Figure 3.7

2010;26(1):133–142 [ Reference Pan, Caswell and Karniadakis 109 ] by the American Chemical Society Whether the colloid particle is simulated as an aggregate of solvent beads or as a separate larger particle, the size of the solvent particles is an appreciable fraction of the size of the colloidal particle. This creates two problems when the colloidal particles approach each other closely. First, the few, or no, solvent particles remaining in the gap between the colloidal particles are unable to properly represent the lubricating hydrodynamic forces between the particles. Second, when there is no room between the colloids for the solvent particles, a depletion force arises that drives the colloids together to free up more room for the excluded solvent particles outside of the gap. These problems are addressed by the “core-modified” DPD method of Whittle and Travis [ Reference Whittle and Travis 110 ], which, like the method of Pan et al. [ Reference Pan, Caswell and Karniadakis 109 ],
uses noncentrosymmetric, dissipative interactions, which occur over a “shell” layer surrounding a particle core that is prevented from overlapping other particle cores through a strong core–core repulsion. Another dissipative force between DPD colloids is used to represent the lubrication force, using analytical theory to provide the form of this force. Issues with including depletion can be offset by including an additional counteracting force that is based on an analytical expression for dilute suspensions [ Reference Whittle and Travis 110 ].
Jamali et al. [ Reference Jamali, Boromand, Wagner and Maia 111 ] and Boromand et al. [ Reference Boromand, Jamali, Grove and Maia 112 ] have very recently extended the method of Whittle and Travis [ Reference Whittle and Travis 110 ] by including elastohydrodynamic deformation
resulting from compressive forces acting on the particles as they are driven together by flow. Thus, they solved the following equation: m i d v i d t = ∑ F ij C + F ij D + F ij R + F ij el + F ij H + F ij Core − n t , (3.9) where the conservative, dissipative, and random force terms (the first three on the right side) are similar to those of conventional DPD, discussed earlier. The fourth
term is an electrostatic interaction (if needed). The lubrication (pair-drag) term is given by: F ij H = − μ ij H v ij ⋅ e ij e ij ; μ ij H = 3 πη 0 a 3 / 2 δ , 0 < h ij ≤ δ 3 πη 0 a 3 / 2 h ij , h ij > δ , (3.10) which regularizes the normal lubrication term by limiting the force to a maximum one at a lubrication layer thickness of
δ δ . Here
a
is the colloidal particle radius.
η m η m
is the viscosity of the suspending medium and the gap between particles

and j is
h ij . Finally, the “core” force includes both a normal ( n ) and a tangential ( t ) force, the latter of which can support both static and sliding stress, is influenced by particle roughness
Δ Δ , and is described by Jamali et al. [ Reference Jamali, Boromand, Wagner and Maia 111 ] and in most recently modified form by Boromand et al. [ Reference Boromand, Jamali, Grove and Maia 112 ]. In the simulations of Jamali et al. [ Reference Jamali, Boromand, Wagner and Maia 111 ],
δ δ
was set to 10 ‒6 a , while
Δ Δ
was set to 10 ‒3 a , where

Stokesian dynamics
[ Reference Boromand, Jamali, Grove and Maia 112 ].

shows that the predictions of these “core-modified” DPD simulations are in qualitative agreement with experimental data for

N 1
in the lubricated shear thickening regime to positive values in the frictional regime where a percolated pathway of frictional contacts emerges, a normal-stress transition seen in recent experiments [ Reference Royer, Blair and Hudson 113 ]. Such features of shear thickening in hard sphere colloidal suspensions are discussed in

Journal of Rheology
2018;62(4):905–918 [ Reference Boromand, Jamali, Grove and Maia 112 ], by The Society of Rheology These various corrections to DPD, while yielding results similar to those from rigorous Stokesian dynamics, do not yet provide quantitative agreement to date to experimental data for hard sphere dispersions over the complete range of particle concentration and shear rate. In addition, Whittle and Travis [ Reference Whittle and Travis 110 ] find, for their core-modified method, that the short-time diffusivity increases with increasing particle volume fraction above
ϕ ϕ
= 0.4, rather than decreasing, as it does in experiments and in SD simulations. (They believe this result to be general to DPD simulations, although it was not reported on in the work of Jamali et al. [ Reference Jamali, Boromand, Wagner and Maia 111 ] or Boromand et al. [ Reference Boromand, Jamali, Grove and Maia 112 ]). However, it appears that with recent modifications the DPD method is approaching the accuracy of Stokesian dynamics for both dilute and dense suspensions [ Reference Mai-Duy, Pan, Phan-Thien and Khoo 106 ]. Spheroidal and rod- and disk-like particles have also been simulated by DPD simulations [ Reference Boek, Coveney, Lekkerkerker and vanderSchoot 115 – Reference Huang, Marson and Larson 117 ]. The DPD method is very versatile and can be applied readily to flow of dispersed droplets, as well as nonspherical particles such as spheroids, and can readily accommodate the effects of inertia. It has recently been used to compute inertial focusing of droplets and particles in channel flows, for example [ Reference Huang, Marson and Larson 107 , Reference Huang, Marson and Larson 117 , Reference Marson, Huang, Huang, Fu and Larson 118 ]. 3.5
Particle Solvent Methods – Meshed Solvent
3.5.1
Multi-Particle Collision
(MPC) Dynamics, or Stochastic Rotation Dynamics (SRD)
A method formerly known as Stochastic Rotation Dynamics
(SRD) [ Reference Malevanets and Kapral 119 , Reference Ihle and Kroll 120 ], but now frequently called Multi-Particle Collision (MPC) dynamics [ Reference Gompper, Ihle, Kroll, Winkler, Holm and Kremer 121 ], is both lattice and particle based, sharing the advantages and disadvantages of both. The method has two basic steps: (1) a simple constant-velocity streaming flow and (2) an en masse “collision” of solvent particles, in which momentum is exchanged among all particles within each of the cubic cells into which the domain is gridded. In the simplest version of MPC dynamics, this momentum exchange is carried out as follows: the center-of-mass velocity of the particles in each lattice cell is subtracted from the velocities of all particles in that cell. The resulting relative velocities are then rotated through a random angle, which preserves linear momentum within the cell since these rotated velocities retain zero mean velocity. The streaming and collisions steps of the method are given by: r i t + Δ t = r i t + v i t Δ t (3.11) v i t + Δ t = u t + Ω v i t − u t , (3.12) where
Ω Ω
is the rotation matrix and
u ( t ) u t
is mean velocity in the MPC cell. The position and velocity of the solvent particle
i
are
r i
and
v i . The rotation process exchanges momentum of particles in the cell, permitting momentum diffusion. Because the momentum is exchanged among many particles (5–10) within a single cell in one step, pair-wise addition of momentum exchange is avoided, as are neighbor lists, making the method much faster, for a given number of solvent particles, than DPD in
particular [ Reference Zhao, Wang, Jiang and Larson 122 ]. For the solvent flow, MPC simulations have nonzero inertia and fluid compressibility as potential artifacts, if one is attempting to simulate incompressible Stokes flow. The compressibility of an MPC fluid is greater than for typical DPD fluids, since in MPC the solvent particles have no repulsive interactions and therefore have the compressibility of an ideal gas rather than of a liquid. The Mach number can therefore become high enough to induce significant density changes [ Reference Zhao, Wang, Jiang and Larson 122 ]. The compressibility of the fluid could of course be countered by applying repulsive interactions between the solvent particles, but this would introduce pairwise momentum exchange during “collisions” and the advantageous speed of MPC dynamics would be lost. So the velocity must be kept low, relative to the thermal velocity of the solvent beads, to prevent unacceptable compression of the fluid. The low velocities mean that runs must be longer to average out Brownian noise [ Reference Zhao, Wang, Jiang and Larson 122 ]. It also means that the Schmidt number of an MPC fluid, measuring the ratio of momentum to mass diffusivities, is near unity, typical of a gas rather than of a liquid. For objects which are large compared to the typical grid spacing, the small Schmidt number need not be a serious problem. MPC dynamics has been applied to colloids by introducing repulsive interactions between large colloidal particles and between solvent and particles [ Reference Padding and Louis 123 ]. The range of the colloid–solvent repulsion sets the range of depletion interactions that induce short-range attraction between the colloids – a limitation of the method for hard sphere fluids. A similar limitation exists for DPD fluids, which also use solvent particles to carry momentum. This depletion artifact can be limited by shortening the range of the colloid–solvent interaction [ Reference Padding and Louis 123 ]. Another, related, problem with MPC fluids, similar to that in DPD fluids, is the limit on its ability to capture short-range lubrication interactions, again set by the range of the colloid–solvent repulsive interaction, which sets the gap between colloidal particles below which solvent particles are squeezed out and lubrication fails. Padding and Louis [ Reference Padding and Louis 123 ] very thoroughly discuss the dimensionless groups controlling the behavior of colloids in MPC simulations, including relationships among Reynolds number, Mach number, Knudsen number, and how they relate to colloid size, grid size, and solvent mean-free path. The time scales of the method are also thoroughly discussed in the same publication. Schunk et al. [ Reference Schunk, Pierce, Lechman, Grillet, Veld and Weiss 33 ] have compared predictions of colloidal rheology predicted by LAMMPS versions of MPC with that of Dissipative Particle Dynamics and found much better performance with MPC simulations. MPC simulations have been used to study the transition to a nematic phase in a suspension of rod-like particles [ Reference Ripoll, Winkler, Mussawisade and Gompper 124 ], as well as sedimentation dynamics [ Reference Padding and Louis 125 ]. 3.5.2
Lattice Boltzmann Method
The Lattice Boltzmann (LB) method was born out of earlier work with lattice gas simulations [ Reference Frisch, Hasslacher and Pomeau 126 – Reference Succi 129 ] but with a simple empirical collision operator, such as the Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook operator, that greatly increases the flexibility of the LB method [ Reference Dunweg, Ladd, Holm and Kremer 128 , Reference Succi 129 ]. The novelty in LB simulations relative to other methods is the discretization in momentum space as well as in real space and time, wherein fictitious
“particles” carry momentum only in a discrete set of directions with discrete values of the momentum. While resolution of ordinary finite differencing or finite elements is limited by time and space discretization, LB goes “whole-hog” by also losing local resolution in momentum space. Since accuracy is seriously limited anyway at the small length and time scales, the additional loss due to discretization in momentum space is not particularly serious, at least not in comparison to the gain in speed, relative to particle-based methods that retain a continuous distribution of particle momentum, such as in the DPD method or MD simulations. In this sense, as explained by Li et al. [ Reference Li, Luo, Kang, He, Chen and Liu 130 ] in a chart of simulation methods with resolution of velocity on one axis and computational intensity on the other, LB resides between Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of the Navier–Stokes equation and DPD on the other, with MD simulations on the extreme of high resolution/high computational cost. If one wishes to use the cheapest particle-based method, and does not need or want Brownian fluctuations, the LB method becomes a prime candidate to consider. Of course, there are challenges and limitations to the method. Care is required to perform the discretization properly, and there is a substantial literature on this. For high Reynolds number flows, the BGK (single-relaxation-time) operator leads to artificial instabilities [ Reference Lallemand and Luo 131 ], which can be ameliorated by use of a multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) collision operator [ Reference Li, Luo, Kang, He, Chen and Liu 130 ]. The LB method seems to be technically more demanding than some of the other particle-based methods such as DPD and MPC simulations. However, commercial codes for LB simulations exist, and the LB method is now routinely used in simulations of fluid mechanics problems as a substitute for other standard methods [ Reference Succi 129 ], and is especially good at allowing tortuous boundary conditions, such as that of porous media. Brief reviews of the method are available elsewhere [ Reference Harting, Frijters, Ramaioli, Robinson, Wolf and Luding 95 , Reference Dunweg, Ladd, Holm and Kremer 128 , Reference Li, Luo, Kang, He, Chen and Liu 130 ]. To apply the method to suspensions, Brownian motion can be added, which is not native to the original method. Ladd [ Reference Ladd 87 , Reference Ladd 132 ] accomplished this by adding a stochastic contribution to the collision operator, to which improvements were added by Dunweg et al. [ Reference Dunweg, Schiller and Ladd 127 ] and Adhikari et al. [ Reference Adhikari, Stratford, Cates and Wagner 133 ] to ensure equipartition of energy on all length scales. In addition, for suspensions, the transport of momentum across a fluid–solid boundary must be managed. This was initially done by modifying the “bounce-back” rule for stationary surfaces [ Reference Ladd and Frenkel 59 , Reference Ladd 87 ] to moving surfaces. Later, it was performed by coupling the motion of the colloidal particle to the fluid through a frictional drag [ Reference Ahlrichs and Dunweg 134 , Reference Ahlrichs and Dunweg 135 ], similar to the method used in the Immersed Boundary (IB) method [ Reference Peskin 136 , Reference Nash, Adhikari and Cates 137 ]. Discretization of a spherically curved surface is carried out by finding the links between lattice nodes that the curved surface cuts; see
Figure 3.9 . LB fluid “particles” (which are actually momentum packets) moving along these links interact with the solid at the halfway point along the links, thus producing a discretization that, while not smooth locally, represents the particle more accurately as the grid is refined. Even when the particle diameter is only five times the grid spacing, the hydrodynamic interactions are within 1% of the exact result [ Reference Dunweg, Ladd, Holm and Kremer 128 ]; except when particles come into close proximity; see

Data from Dünweg and Ladd [ Reference Dunweg, Ladd, Holm and Kremer 128 ] Typically sized particles used in LB simulations have radii less than five lattice spacings and, for these sizes, hydrodynamics is not properly modeled when particle
separations decrease to 10% of the particle radius or less, which occurs commonly in dense suspensions. Small-separation lubrication corrections have, however, been introduced into LB simulations, resulting in the improvement shown in
Figure 3.10
(closed symbols) [ Reference Dunweg, Ladd, Holm and Kremer 128 ]. Various schemes also exist for introducing non-Newtonian solvent effects into the LB method [ Reference Phillips and Roberts 138 , Reference Papenkort and Voigtmann 139 ]. Ladd [ Reference Ladd 140 ] has provided a recent review of the methods and limitations of LB methods for suspension flows. Beyond suspension flows, the Lattice Boltzmann method has been applied to a huge range of applications; a recent sampling ranges from sedimentation of blood cells [ Reference Hashemi, Rahnama and Jafari 141 ], microchannel suspension flow [ Reference Sun, Wang, Dong and Sun 142 ], granular flows [ Reference Leonardi, Cabrera, Wittel, Kaitna, Mendoza and Wu 143 ], the flow of
non-Newtonian nanofluids, nanoparticle-laden interfaces [ Reference Harting, Frijters, Ramaioli, Robinson, Wolf and Luding 95 ], and many others. The LB method is frequently used as a momentum transport solver in combination with other methods, such as the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM), for tracking compositional fields or interfaces.
3.6
Summary
Many methods are now available for the simulation of suspensions and these are often publicly available. The most numerous are available for spherical hard particles in low Reynolds number flows in Newtonian solvents. For these problems, the linearity of Stokes flow is exploited to great advantage and thousands of particles can be simulated accurately with full hydrodynamic interactions in a variety of geometries using “Stokesian particle” methods, of which there are now multiple codes, under continuous improvement. These methods avoid the need to either grid the solvent or replace it by discrete fluid particles, which conveys the great advantage of being able to handle very thin lubrication layers without excessive grid refinement, which is incurred when using methods requiring meshing of a continuum solvent, or the use of huge numbers of small solvent particles when using particle-solvent methods. “Particle-solvent” methods, which capture hydrodynamics through tracking of discrete solvent particles rather than continua, can however be exploited for spherical particles in Stokes flow, either at lower colloid density, or by using counter-measures to allow lubrication films, as, for example, in the “Core-Modified” Dissipative Particle Dynamics method, which simulates both lubricated and frictional contacts. In addition, particle-solvent methods can become favorable over Stokesian particle methods when inertia is present, when the suspended phase is a liquid or a deformable solid, the solvent is viscoelastic, the particles are nonspherical, or multiple of these features are present simultaneously. If the fluid is complex, and high accuracy is not required, solvent particle methods, especially Brownian dynamics (BD), Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD), Multi-Particle Collision (MPC) dynamics, and Lattice Boltzmann (LB) dynamics, are versatile, and can quickly be adapted to problems with great complexity, such as mixtures containing polymers, colloids, emulsions, swimmers, etc. Establishing the accuracy of such methods and which method to use for a given problem remain outstanding problems. Methods in which the fluid flow between particles is resolved using a meshed continuum have been covered here in less detail. These include the Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) method, the Distributed Lagrange Multiplier/Fictitious Domain (DLM/FD) method, the Force Coupling Method (FCM), the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM), Fluid Particle Dynamics (FPD), and the Smoothed Profile Method (SPM). It seems unclear at present how to judge the relative strengths and weaknesses of these methods relative to the others covered here in more detail. It would be valuable in the future to establish benchmark problems by which the relative merits and demerits of the various methods can be assessed.

Faraday Discussions of the Chemical Society
The First Rideal Lecture. Microemulsions, a field at the border between lyophobic and lyophilic colloids
J. Th. G.
Overbeek
Abstract
Microemulsions can be regarded as thermodynamically stable dispersions of droplets of one phase in another phase. There are continuous transitions to swollen micelles, when the droplets become extremely small, and to coarse emulsions when the droplets are large. The mechanism leading to the formation of microemulsions is the tendency to extend the interfacial area until the concentrations of surfactants are sufficiently low that non-negative interfacial tension is achieved. The role of the combination of a surfactant and a cosurfactant is seen in their leading to a decrease in the interfacial tension to potentially negative values. An expression is given for the Gibbs energy of the whole system, for the special case of an ionized surfactant and a non-ionized cosurfactant. The minimization of this Gibbs energy leads to the stability conditions for the microemulsion. The factors which promote O/W and W/O emulsions, respectively, are briefly discussed. The electrical contribution to the interfacial tension depends on the particle size. This leads to a narrow size distribution. It is finally pointed out that, in principle, fine dispersions of solids in a liquid may be thermodynamically stable in the presence of large amounts of easily adsorbed compounds.

Abstract An optoelectronic material with a spatially varying bandgap that is tunable is highly desirable for use in photovoltaics, photocatalysis and photodetection. Elastic strain has the potential to be used to achieve rapid and reversible tuning of the bandgap. However, as a result of plasticity or fracture, conventional materials cannot sustain a high enough elastic strain to create sufficient changes in their physical properties. Recently, an emergent class of materials—named ‘ultrastrength materials’—have been shown to avoid inelastic relaxation up to a significant fraction of their ideal strength. Here, we illustrate theoretically and computationally that elastic strain is a viable agent for creating a continuously varying bandgap profile in an initially homogeneous, atomically thin membrane. We propose that a photovoltaic device made from a strain-engineered MoS 2
monolayer will capture a broad range of the solar spectrum and concentrate excitons or charge carriers.

Main The ability to continuously control the bandgap in optoelectronic materials, in a low-cost manner, is highly desirable for a wide range of energy and sensing applications, including photovoltaics 1 , 2 , 3 , photocatalysis 4
and photodetection 5 . For example, the efficiency of photovoltaic devices comprising a single p–n junction is subject to the thermodynamic constraint of the Shockley–Queisser limit 1 , as only a limited portion of solar energy can be absorbed. Although tandem solar cells consisting of multijunctions with cascaded bandgaps can achieve higher absorption efficiencies, the increased complexity of their fabrication and the high cost of materials are major drawbacks. It would therefore be a great advantage if one could fine-tune the bandgap within a single semiconducting material. Like chemical composition, elastic strain is a continuous variable that is capable of altering many physical and chemical properties. Although elastic strain engineering is a straightforward concept, its potential in photonics remains largely under-exploited. The key hurdle is the fact that conventional bulk-scale materials cannot sustain a high enough elastic strain to induce sufficient changes to the physical properties before they deform plastically or break. Recently, materials belonging to an emergent class termed ‘ultrastrength materials’ 6 , 7 , 8
have been found to avoid inelastic relaxation up to a significant fraction of their ideal strengths; that is, materials of different size and dimensionality can exhibit dramatically distinct physical and chemical properties as well as mechanical strengths. Atomically thin membranes are a notable family of materials that exhibit the property of ultrastrength 8 , 9 . The elastic strain of a graphene monolayer has been predicted theoretically and also measured experimentally to be as high as 25% (refs  8 , 10 , 11 ), while that of bulk graphite rarely survives beyond 0.1% strain. Recently, a monolayer of molybdenum disulphide (MoS 2 ) was experimentally exfoliated and characterized. It demonstrated an effective in-plane strain of up to 11% (ref.  12 ), a direct bandgap of 1.9 eV under strain-free conditions 13 , 14
and a more than 10,000-fold enhancement of its luminescence quantum yield compared to its bulk counterpart 13 . The high elastic strain limit should make it possible to control the electronic and optical properties of two-dimensional materials through simple elastic strain engineering, which is often infeasible in their three-dimensional bulk phases. In addition, the lattice symmetry of MoS 2
also demonstrates a unique valley-selective circular dichroism 15 , 16 . Here, we illustrate theoretically and computationally that elastic strain is a viable agent for creating a continuously varying bandgap profile in an initially homogeneous, atomically thin membrane. As a proof of concept, an ‘artificial atom’ made of a nanoindented MoS 2
monolayer was investigated and predicted to be able to absorb a broad range of the solar spectrum from 2.0 eV to 1.1 eV as the biaxial strain increases from 0% to 9%. More importantly, the continuous spatial variation of electron and hole energies, together with the large exciton binding energy in the MoS 2
artificial atoms, makes it a unique solar energy funnel for conveying and concentrating the photoexcited charge carriers along the elastic strain gradient. Introducing inhomogeneous elastic strain When subjecting an atomically thin membrane to a simple external load, as shown in
Fig. 1 a, an inhomogeneous strain field can be created. The equilibrium geometry for a thin membrane is given by the Föppl–Hencky equation for membrane deformation under a stretching force at the boundaries only. For the geometry depicted in
Fig. 1 a, we have, for any line
λ ( y ),
h ∫ λ d x
σ α  =  f α , where
f α
is the stretching force on the boundary and
h
is the nominal membrane thickness. Owing to the force balance, the continuously narrowing membrane geometry can efficiently focus the tensile strain. Figure 1: Introducing inhomogeneous strain and classifying funnelling mechanisms. a , Schematic of an inhomogeneously strained membrane ribbon with varying width
λ
(dashed line). The two electrodes mechanically impose a vertical displacement on the central region of the membrane. Without the two electrodes, the equilibrium geometry of the membrane is flat.
b , Schematic device setup for elastic strain-engineered artificial atom (not drawn to scale). Notice that although the bulk of the electrodes are metallic (for example, transparent conducting oxide), they are coated with semiconducting buffers to facilitate selective quasiparticle collection (detailed in the text). This setup completely removes the edges of the membrane ribbon in
a , as these can serve as preferential sites for stress-aided defect nucleation.
c – e , Three broad-spectrum solar energy funnelling mechanisms arising from a different band bending and exciton binding profile in the strain-engineered semiconducting membrane. Full size image For the proposed device to function, inelastic strain relaxation as a result of dislocation plasticity or fracture must be avoided 6 . With a high-quality atomic membrane with minimal lattice defects, the edge lengths should also be minimized, as they are preferential sites for stress-aided defect nucleation 17 . We thus arrive at a setup similar to nanoindentation 18 , where a semiconducting membrane covers a circular hole on a substrate, with its rim clamped ( Fig. 1 b). A force probe is used to indent the suspended membrane, which will then deform towards a bottom contact. The stress gradient and hence the elastic strain gradient are maintained by the concentrated load setup with the stress scaling inversely with the radius:
σ r  ≈ 1/ r
for
r  <  R
(outer radius). Such a strain field resembles the potential field of a two-dimensional hydrogenic atom (but at a much larger length scale). It is in this sense that the strain-engineered atomic membrane can be regarded as a mesoscopic ‘artificial atom’ with electronic and optical properties that depend strongly on the strain and stress fields. Broad-spectrum solar energy funnel The connection between elastic strain and electronic structure in a strain-engineered artificial atom becomes apparent when the membrane is a semiconductor whose bandgap reflects a covalent bonding interaction. When stretched elastically, the covalent interaction generally weakens as the bonds lengthen, and consequently becomes a function of the imposed strain field. The stress is expected to exert significant modulation on the band energies and bandgap, analogous to band bending in a diode. The general principle here is to create a device with an electronic structure that has a continuous spatial variation due to an inhomogeneous strain field. The scenario of continuous band bending leads us to propose the concept of a solar energy funnel. Based on the energy profiles of quasiparticles (that is, electrons and holes) and photoexcited states (that is, free electron–hole pairs or strongly bound excitons), three funnelling mechanisms are possible, as shown in
Fig. 1 c–e. In a Type I funnel, the energy level of photoexcited electrons continuously decreases towards the centre, while that of holes increases. Consequently, charge carriers are concentrated at the centre, as long as the lifetime of carriers is large enough for carrier migration before electron–hole recombination takes place. However, if both levels decrease with increasing strain, the result will depend on the strength of the Coulomb interaction between the quasiparticles, that is, the exciton binding energy. With weak exciton binding, electron–hole pairs will be separated by the built-in field and move in opposite directions, resulting in a Type II funnel. On the other hand, if the binding energy of an exciton is large enough to hold the electron–hole pair together despite the built-in field, the decreasing exciton energy profile will drive the exciton to migrate towards the centre. A device based on this mechanism is classified as a Type III funnel. In all three types, the varying band/carrier energy leads to a funnelling effect. The strength of exciton binding energy determines whether Type II or III funnelling will operate in the device when the quasiparticle energy of both electron and hole decreases towards the centre of the membrane. A key advantage of such a strain-engineered device is that the performance of these devices can be adjusted to the lighting environment, as the optical bandgap is also continuously tunable. Strain-dependent properties of MoS 2
monolayer The structure of the MoS 2
monolayer is shown in the inset to
Fig. 2 d ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ) and exhibits a remarkable trigonal prismatic geometry 15 , 16 , 19 . On application of a biaxial strain, Poisson contraction 20
is expected. Owing to its hexagonal space group ( ) symmetry, the MoS 2
monolayer has isotropic in-plane elasticity, so the bandgap depends only on the two-dimensional hydrostatic strain invariant to the linear order. We therefore focus on the effect of biaxial strain on electronic structure. First-principles density functional theory 21 , 22
(DFT) calculations (see
Methods ) indicate that both direct and indirect DFT bandgaps decrease ( Fig. 2 a,b), so a transition from direct bandgap to indirect bandgap occurs once the biaxial strain is applied. Other groups 23 , 24
have recently reported a similar DFT bandgap reduction under biaxial tensile strain. Figure 2: Strain-dependent electronic and optical properties of MoS 2
monolayer. a , Electronic DFT band structure of monolayer MoS 2
under different biaxial strains from 0% (blue line) to 9% (red line).
b , Direct and indirect bandgaps under different biaxial strains calculated using DFT and GW. The GW direct bandgap refers to the minimal direct transition energy. It is located at the K points of the hexagonal Brillouin zone, indicated by an arrow in
a . The corresponding lowest optical excitation energy (black triangles) is calculated by BSE on top of GW quasiparticle energies with electron–hole Coulomb interaction included.

d , Biaxial strain-dependent GW quasiparticle energies for electrons and holes at the K point. Inset: atomic structure of MoS 2
monolayer. Full size image To acquire an accurate electronic band energy profile for the device design, we also performed many-body GW calculations 25 , 26
(G, Green's function; W, screened Coulomb interaction; see
Methods ). The strain-dependent bandgaps are shown in
Fig. 2 b, and the strain-dependent energy levels for an electron and hole at the K point in the first Brillouin zone are shown in
Fig. 2 d. As shown in
Fig. 2 b, the direct and indirect bandgaps calculated from DFT and GW are indeed similar, except for a constant shift of 0.7 eV. Furthermore, the dielectric functions and electron energy loss spectrum of a MoS 2
monolayer are also predicted to undergo substantial changes under biaxial tensile strain ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ). The biaxial strain also modifies the absorption spectra and optical gap of the monolayer—the latter being another physical quantity important for device operation. As screening is generally reduced in a two-dimensional material, photoexcited quasiparticles in a MoS 2
monolayer are expected to experience stronger Coulomb attractions. We therefore go beyond the random-phase approximation by solving the Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE) 27 , 28
with GW quasiparticle energies. The calculated strain-dependent optical absorption spectra are displayed in
Fig. 2 c and show that the direct-to-indirect transition of the bandgap with biaxial strain does not affect the strength of the vertical optical absorption compared to the GW direct bandgap in
Fig. 2 b, BSE; it only shifts the whole spectrum to lower energy due to exciton binding. The lowest optical excitation in
Fig. 2 c originates from the doubly degenerate singlet excitons around the K points 29 . The exciton energy of 2.0 eV at zero strain is in excellent agreement with the A peak at 1.9 eV measured using photoluminescence spectroscopy 13 , 14
(the fine structure due to spin–orbit coupling discussed in ref. 29 is ignored here as it will not affect the main conclusion of strain-dependent electronic and optical energies). The excitation energy experiences substantial reduction when the strain is imposed, decreasing to 1.1 eV at 9% biaxial strain. We then arrive at a roughly constant exciton binding energy of 0.5 eV from 0% to 9% biaxial strain. Such large constant exciton binding energy together with the reduced quasiparticle energies ( Fig. 2 d) makes the strain-engineered artificial MoS 2
atom a Type III solar energy funnel. Exciton wavefunctions for the lowest excitation under zero strain are displayed in
Supplementary Fig. S3 . The hole state is dominated by
and
d xy
orbitals of molybdenum atoms and
p x
and
p y
orbitals of sulphur atoms, and the electron state is dominated by
d
z
2
orbitals of molybdenum atoms. The large exciton radius ( ∼ 2 nm) and exciton binding energy ( ∼ 0.5 eV) indicate a mixed Frenkel–Wannier–Mott exciton character. This arises from the reduced screening in two-dimensional atomically thin materials and thus stronger Coulomb attraction between electrons and holes upon photoexcitation. Nanoindented MoS 2
monolayer as artificial atoms To compute the morphology of the MoS 2
monolayer in the proposed device, we used a bicontinuum finite-element simulation 30 , with a force field parameterized in the Tersoff potential form 31
(see
Supplementary Information ). This coarse-grained force field method yields essentially the same membrane morphology as the analytical solution to the Föppl–Hencky equations 32
( Supplementary Fig. S4 ). The computed morphology of the deformed membrane shows characteristic scale invariance; that is,
w / R
as a function of
r / R
is nearly independent of
R
for
R  > 100 Å, where
w
is the vertical displacement at radius
r . In practice, a force probe with a rounded tip ( Fig. 1 b) can be used to avoid stress singularity near the centre. A relaxed atomic structure of nanoindented MoS 2
membrane is shown in
Fig. 3 a, demonstrating a maximum vertical displacement of
Z  =  R /5. The displacement increases gradually towards the centre of the membrane. This is expected as the boundary conditions (edge clamping and central indenting) have cylindrical symmetry, and the hexagonal lattice implies the same symmetry in the Young's modulus and Poisson ratio 33 . The computed biaxial field is visualized in
Fig. 3 b (see
Supplementary Information
for calculation details). Right at the clamped rim of the suspended membrane, the biaxial strain has a small abrupt increase due to the boundary used in the simulation. As one moves inwards, the strain increases quickly, corresponding to the increase in radial stress. Because the tip of the force probe is rounded, the elastic strain does not diverge near the centre of the membrane. Figure 3: Structural and physical properties of nanoindented MoS 2

c , d , Corresponding local electron and hole energy profile ( c ) and local exciton energy profile ( d ). These are directly mapped from the profiles of homogeneously biaxial strained MoS 2
monolayer against the biaxial invariants of the strain tensor in inhomonegeously deformed MoS 2
membrane under indentation. Full size image With the computed strain pattern shown in
Fig. 3 b, we can map out the energy profiles of electronic and optical excitations on the membrane in a semiclassical sense, using those of the MoS 2
monolayer under different amounts of homogeneous biaxial strain, as presented above. The mapped band edges of electrons and holes and the energy profile of excitons for the representative membrane are shown in
Fig. 3 c and d, respectively. Both valence and conduction band edges are shifted downward from the rim to the centre. At the region with slowly varying strain, there is a large plateau where the positions of the band edges are almost constant, with an area occupying almost two-thirds of the circular region. The spatial variation of exciton energy in the membrane, except for the sign difference, is very similar to the strain profile, as the total exciton energy changes almost linearly with respect to the applied biaxial strain ( Fig. 2 b). The size of Type III solar energy funnel device is essentially constrained by the exciton drift length, beyond which radiative recombination will dominate and prevent the exciton from reaching the electrodes at the centre. The exciton drift length 34
can be estimated by
where
τ 1/2
is the exciton lifetime and 〈 v 〉 drift
is the average drift velocity. The latter is then estimated by the acceleration of the exciton due to the exciton energy gradient
∇ E exc
within phase relaxation time 〈 v 〉 drift . The exciton mass is denoted
m exc . As we would like to have most excitons collected at the centre of the membrane, the radius of the membrane should be set to the drift length, that is,
R  =  l drift . Hence, the spatial gradient of the exciton energy
∇ E exc
can be approximated by Δ E exc / R . We therefore have an effective membrane radius,
In the plateau region, the energy variation Δ E exc
is
∼ 0.1 eV. As we do not know exciton mass
m exc
and phase relaxation time
τ dephase , we approximate them by the electron rest mass
m e
and
∼ 5 ps in GaAs 35 , respectively. Fortunately, the exciton lifetime
τ 1/2
of a MoS 2
monolayer has recently been measured 36 , with a fast photoluminescence decay component of 5 ps at temperatures of
∼ 4.5–150 K and a slow decay component of 100 ps at 270 K. The estimated radius of the atomic membrane is then
∼ 660 nm and 3 µm for the fast and slow decay components, respectively. Compared to the above characteristic size of the membrane, the exciton radius of 2 nm ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ) is indeed much smaller, meaning that the strain profile continuously and smoothly varies over a length scale comparable to the exciton size in the region of interest. The continuum strain mapping procedure is therefore justified. It is now entirely plausible that upon excitation from the ground state, the excitons will be swept by the strain-induced potential gradient and funnelled toward the centre. As both hole and electron carriers are bound in the same direction, we expect that the membrane will stay essentially charge neutral during device operation. This is advantageous, as charging might otherwise significantly reduce the efficiency of the carrier funnelling. The final charge separation and harvesting of solar energy can be achieved by contacting an electron-collecting transparent semiconductor on top of the arrangement and a hole-collecting semiconductor at the bottom ( Fig. 1 b), with appropriate band-edge alignments to ensure one-way electron/hole flow, as in standard photovoltaic technology. As the electron–hole pairs represent energetic excited states, the membrane device works like a battery with an electropotential Δ V ext  < Δ V int . Discussion What we have created in the MoS 2
membrane with the elastic strain pattern is a continuous bending of the energy levels of electrons, holes and excitons, similar to that in a photodiode, except that the photoexcited electron–hole pairs in MoS 2
are strongly bound excitons. When an electron–hole pair is generated in the plateau region following light absorption, the semiclassical potential for the quasiparticles exerts forces on the electron and hole in opposite directions. However, the large exciton binding energy will force the electron–hole pair to hold together like a molecule (despite a small polarization) and migrate towards the centre of the membrane. This is different from the case of a photodiode, where electron–hole pairs quickly dissociate, with the electrons and holes then migrating in opposite directions. Although not central to the proposed photocarrier funnelling effect, the eventual collection of solar energy is also critical. To efficiently extract charge carriers from the centre, the device design shown in the schematic in
Fig. 1 b was proposed, with a band alignment as shown in
Fig. 4 . Such a structure is similar to that of organic photovoltaic cells 37 , 38 . The charge extraction process is accomplished with two carrier-collecting contacts, one of which is the indenter itself, and the other is located beneath the indented MoS 2
membrane. The bulk of the electrodes are made of transparent conducting oxide to maximize illumination of the membrane. Key to the design are two semiconducting buffer layers, which cover the electrodes and come into direct contact with the MoS 2
monolayer. The role of these buffer layers is to selectively admit one type of charge carrier (electron or hole) while blocking the other. The carrier selectivity of these buffers arises from band alignment (detailed in
Fig. 4 ) and follows the standard principle from photovoltaics. The nanoindenter tip in
Fig. 1 b should therefore be made of, or coated with, transparent semiconductors with selected band edges. This is particularly important when building a functional funnel device such as that in
Fig. 1 b, because the buffer layers can help suppress direct tunnelling of carriers between anode and cathode and allow for efficient extraction of charge carriers. A layered patterning scheme is also proposed in
Supplementary Fig. S6
to achieve arrays of strain-engineered artificial atoms. Figure 4: Schematic of charge extraction near the centre of the atomic membrane. The atomic membrane lies on the
x–y
plane, and the indentation is along the
z -direction. Two semiconducting buffer layers between the MoS 2
monolayer and the two electrodes serve as electron-selective and hole-selective transporters due to their specific band alignment with respect to the MoS 2
monolayer. These two buffer layers are thick enough to make direct tunnelling negligible. In addition, a transparent conducting oxide is used as the cathode so as not to block the incoming light from the top. Full size image The concept of a solar energy funnel achieved by engineering the electronic band energy and optical bandgap is not entirely new, and has been demonstrated experimentally in several nanostructures with graded gaps, including layer-by-layer assembled CdTe nanocrystals of different sizes 39
and core–shell and corrugated carbon nanotube filaments 40 . Here, however, we have explored an alternative approach by generating continuously varying electronic band energy and optical bandgap in two-dimensional atomically thin membranes, by means of inhomogeneous elastic strain engineering within a single crystalline material. We would like to emphasize that it is the varying profile of band energy that leads to the direct funnelling effect, while the strength of the exciton binding energy determines whether a Type II or Type III funnel device is created. The present approach is enabled by recent rapid advances in two-dimensional atomically thin sheets such as graphene, hexagonal boron-nitride, MoS 2
monolayer and so on. All of these have been exfoliated experimentally and characterized to have very high elastic strain limits. In addition, MoS 2
has some other attractive properties such as high thermal stability and chemical inertness. We therefore expect that the proposed funnel device can be verified by experiments in the near future. In closing, we would like to make three remarks. First, photovoltaic conversion and the solar energy funnel are not the only applications of the proposed artificial atom. For example, without the electrodes, the excitons concentrated at the centre will be relaxed through radiative recombination, resulting in stronger luminescence near the centre of the membrane. This may be useful for exciton lasing, if an appropriate resonator design is devised 41 . The unique feature of the device, as exemplified above, is its mechanical tunability; the frequency and intensity of the emission can be tuned continuously by varying the applied strain to the atomic membrane. Second, the concept of a strain-engineered artificial atom may work with many other atomically thin sheets, including GaS, GaSe, GaTe, MX 2 -type dichalcogenides (M=Mo, Nb, Ni, Sn, Ti, Ta, Pt, V, W, Hf and so on, and X=S, Se, Te), M 2 X 3 -type trichalcogenides (M=As, Bi, Sb and so on, and X=S, Se, Te), MPX 3
(X=S, Se), MAX 3
(A=Si, Ge, and X=S, Se, Te), and alloy sheets like M x M′ 1– x S 2 . It can also be applied to other thin membranes based on conventional materials, such as a silicon nanomembrane 42 , which can sustain a significant tensile strain of a few percent. This level of tension is sufficient to induce the proposed funnelling effect, even though the driving force is still not as large as in maximally indented atomic sheets. Finally, although we illustrate the application of the elastically deformed membrane semiconductor as a solar energy concentrator, we would also like to emphasize the more general notion of it being a tunable artificial atom. Each deformable membrane should have its own characteristic excitations (electronic and electromagnetic). Upon juxtaposition, they will interact electronically and optically. It is our hope, then, that complex superlattice arrays of these artificial atoms can be built on a whole membrane, the properties of which will be tuned at the level of the fundamental ‘atomic’ building blocks by strain engineering. Methods Ground-state properties of MoS 2
monolayer The ground-state atomic structure of MoS 2
monolayer under different biaxial strains was first assessed by DFT 21 , 22
calculations. These were carried out using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) with a plane wave basis 43 , 44
and the projector-augmented wave method 45 . Exchange-correlation functionals in a Perdew–Berke–Ernzerhof (PBE) form 46
within the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) 47 , 48
were used in all DFT calculations. We adopted the Monkhorst–Pack scheme 49
of
k -point sampling for zone integration, and selected the number of
k -points to achieve a convergence in total energy within
∼ 1 meV/atom. The total energy of each optimized structure was calculated again with the more accurate tetrahedron zone summation with Blöchl correction 50 . A qualitative electronic band structure for different biaxial tensile strain was also obtained from DFT–PBE calculations. Excited-state properties of MoS 2
monolayer Two physical quantities related to this design of solar energy funnel are the electronic excitation energy (quasiparticle band energy for electron and hole) and optical excitation energy (exciton energy). However, neither of these can be obtained accurately from DFT Kohn–Sham eigen energies using the GGA exchange-correlation function. We therefore computed quasiparticle energies for electrons and holes using many-body perturbation theory calculations within Hedin's G 0 W 0
approximation 25 , 26 , while the optical absorption spectra and exciton energies were further obtained by solving a Bethe–Salpeter equation 27 , 28
on top of G 0 W 0
quasiparticle energies within the Tamm–Dancoff approximation, which explicitly takes into account Coulomb interactions between quasi-electrons and quasi-holes. Here, an energy cutoff of 350 eV and Monkhorst–Pack
k -point sampling of 18 × 18 × 1 were chosen. Both GW and BSE calculations require much more computational effort and memory storage than DFT calculations, because the GW method needs to evaluate frequency-dependent non-local self-energy and the BSE method is essentially solving two-particle Green's function, whereas DFT with GGA functions is intrinsically local and frequency-independent. Because an exciton corresponds to the excitation of electron–hole pairs, its wavefunction is a six-dimensional quantity,
, where
and
are electron and hole wavefunctions. We have reconstructed exciton wavefunctions and plotted out the corresponding electron (hole) wavefunction by holding its counterpart hole (electron) at a specific location ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). Spin–orbit coupling is not included as it will not affect the main conclusion of strain–dependent electronic and optical bandgaps of MoS 2
monolayer. Geometry of the MoS 2
membrane under nanoindentation Owing to the large size of the atomic membrane under consideration here, it is unrealistic for us to relax the nanoindented membrane by first-principles DFT calculation directly. We therefore fitted a set of Tersoff potential parameters for MoS 2 , and then performed force-field calculations to obtain the geometry of the MoS 2
membrane under indentation. More details are provided in the
