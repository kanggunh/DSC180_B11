Improved charge extraction in inverted perovskite solar cells with dual-site-binding ligands/n/nInverted (pin) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) afford improved operating stability in comparison to their nip counterparts but have lagged in power conversion efficiency (PCE). The energetic losses responsible for this PCE deficit in pin PSCs occur primarily at the interfaces between the perovskite and the charge-transport layers. Additive and surface treatments that use passivating ligands usually bind to a single active binding site: This dense packing of electrically resistive passivants perpendicular to the surface may limit the fill factor in pin PSCs. We identified ligands that bind two neighboring lead(II) ion (Pb 2+ ) defect sites in a planar ligand orientation on the perovskite. We fabricated pin PSCs and report a certified quasi-steady state PCE of 26.15 and 24.74% for 0.05-and 1.04-square centimeter illuminated areas, respectively. The devices retain 95% of their initial PCE after 1200 hours of continuous 1 sun maximum power point operation at 65°C. T he certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has reached an impressive 25.7%  (1) . Nevertheless, the most-efficient PSCs, fabricated in the nip architecture, have yet to achieve the needed operating stability under accelerated aging tests  (1, 2) . Inverted (pin) PSCs, which do not rely on p-type dopants in their hole-transporting layers  (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) , have seen progress but, until now, still lag behind their nip counterparts: Their stabilized PCE has so far reached only 25.1%  (8) . The interfaces between the perovskite and the chargetransport layers limit the PCE of pin cells  (9) (10) (11)  through band misalignment  (12)  and energylevel pinning  (11) . These problems are aggravated by the presence of surface defects. For example, undercoordinated Pb 2+ ions  (13) (14) (15)  result in nonradiative recombination at the perovskite-charge transport layer interface, which limits photovoltage and fill factor (FF). Surface passivation of the perovskite active layer is used to suppress interface nonradiative recombination  (14, 16) . The efficacy of bulk additives as well as solution-based treatments with ammonium ligands is now well estab-lished  (17, 18) . However, these ligands bind at a single active binding site to the perovskite structure, and this has the potential to produce dense packing of passivants aligned perpendicular to the surface, introducing an unwanted resistive barrier between the perovskite and the electron transport layer (ETL)  (16, (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) . We sought routes to passivate undercoordinated Pb 2+ at the surfaces and grain boundaries of the perovskite with passivator ligands aligning parallel to the perovskite surface instead. 
 Theoretical investigations We began by considering candidate molecules that contain a benzene ring because its flat structure is expected to lie parallel to a surface compared with the case of linear-chain ligands  (21) . To enable strong binding with perovskite surfaces, we considered both -PO 3 2-and -SO 3 functional groups, each of which is reported to coordinate strongly with Pb 2+  (14, 26) . Because benzenephosphonates are not readily available, we focused on available sulfonates  (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) . We prioritized end functional groups that have a high number of oxygen atoms, a feature recently reported to correlate positively with strong binding  (26) . We then evaluated steric constraints, seeking a ligand sufficiently long that it could bind at multiple surface Pb sites, these being ~6.3 Å apart in the case of formamidinium (FA)-based perovskites. These considerations pointed to benzenesulfonate (BZS) ligands and their derivatives because these molecules have a length of ~5.7 Å. We used density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate how the molecular structure of the ligand affects orientation. We considered three ligands, one with no additional functional group (BZS) and two with methyl or chloride in the para position of the benzene ring opposite to the sulfonate functional group [4-methylbenzenesulfonate (4CH 3 -BZS) and 4-chlorobenzenesulfonate (4Cl-BZS)] (Fig.  1A ). 4CH 3 -BZS and 4Cl-BZS have lengths of 6.14 and 6.37 Å, respectively. We compared the formation energies of two configurations, one in which the ligands were oriented perpendicular to the perovskite surface (Conf-perp; Fig.  1B ) and another in which the ligands adopted a parallel orientation with respect to the perovskite surface (Conf-para; Fig.  1C ). Although Conf-perp was more energetically favorable for BZS and 4CH 3 -BZS, Conf-para was energetically more favorable for 4Cl-BZS because of the additional Pb 2+ surface binding afforded by the Cl functional group (Fig.  1D ) that would enable dual-site Pb 2+ passivation. We also investigated the effects of ligand orientation on charge transfer at the perovskite-ETL interface by examining fullerene (C 60 ), which is widely used as an ETL in pin PSCs and is known to induce energetic losses in devices  (11, 12, 34, 35) . Analysis of the calculated charge density difference (Fig.  1E  and fig.  S1 ) provided evidence that 4Cl-BZS, when absorbed on the perovskite layer, established a notably stronger binding strength with the C 60 layer [adsorption energies (E ads ) = -0.85 eV] in contrast to BZS (E ads = -0.46 eV) and 4CH 3 -BZS (E ads = -0.39 eV)  (36) . Fracture energy (G c ) results show that 4Cl-BZS increases the mechanical strength of the perovskite-C 60 interface (fig.  S2 )  (37) . 
 Ligand-perovskite binding characterization To explore interactions between perovskite and BZS ligands, we began by adding each ligand directly into the precursor solutions and spin-coating Cs 0.05 FA 0.85 MA 0.1 PbI 3 perovskite thin films, where FA is formamidinium and MA is methylamine. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) of untreated (control) and treated films showed that BZS, 4CH 3 -BZS, and 4Cl-BZS were all concentrated near the top (ETL-facing) surface of the perovskite film (fig.  S3 ). This result, combined with x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of control and treated perovskite films that showed no discernable peak-shifting after treatment (fig.  S4 ), indicated that the ligands did not enter the lattice but rather diffused toward the top surface during film crystallization. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of perovskite films with additives are presented in fig.  S5  and illustrate that the perovskite films (both additives and controls) exhibit substantially uniform morphology. We used x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to check for possible evidence of interaction between the additives and perovskite. We observed a shift of the Pb 4f XPS peaks to a lower binding energy for each treated film compared with the peaks of controls (Fig.  2A ). We saw evidence of interaction between Cl and Pb in 4Cl-BZS-treated perovskite from both XPS spectra (Fig.  2B ) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (fig.  S6 ). 
 Optoelectronic characterization of perovskite films and device stacks To evaluate the passivation efficacy of each ligand, we studied photoluminescence (PL) of neat control and treated perovskite films. We observed an increase in PL quantum yield (PLQY) for each of the treated films and the full device stack (Fig.  2C ), with 4Cl-BZS exhibiting a twofold increase in PLQY (41%) compared with control films (20%), which corresponded to a projected 20-mV increase in quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS). The PLQY of full-device stacks [FTO/SAMs/perovskite/C 60 , where FTO is fluorinate tin oxide and SAMs (self-assembled monolayers) are mixtures of 2PACz and Me-4PACz] revealed a substantial improvement after 4Cl-BZS treatment-5% for 4Cl-BZS compared with 0.6% for the control, corresponding to 1.17 and 1.1 V in QFLS for 4Cl-BZS and the control device, respectively. This improvement was consistent with reduced interface losses. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) revealed a similar increase in carrier lifetimes after treatment. Specifically, 4Cl-BZS-treated films exhibited a weighted-average lifetime of 3.0 ms compared with 0.6 ms for the control film (Fig.  2D  and table  S1 ). We fabricated partial and full perovskite/ ETL device stacks to probe interface recombination and charge transfer. First, we conducted TRPL measurements of perovskite/C 60 stacks, wherein decay was dictated by nonradiative surface-bulk recombination (monoexponential decay), radiative recombination (second-order decay), and charge extraction effects, which could be distinguished if the time constants for each process differed sufficiently  (38) . The first interval at shorter times was dominated by the transfer of electrons from the bulk into the C 60 , and the second interval at longer delay times was dominated by interfacial recombination  (39) . The sharp drop in emission for 4Cl-BZS/C 60 indicated efficient electron transfer at the interface, and the longer second-order decay time was indicative of a reduced trap density compared with BZS and 4CH 3 -BZS (fig.  S7 ). This effect of this reduction was especially evident in fits to the TRPL traces to compute the differential lifetime as t = -{d ln[f(t)]/dt} -1 (Fig.  2E ), where f(t) is the time-dependent PL photon flux, because the sharpness of the rise implied the speed of the electron transfer from perovskite to C 60 . Transient photocurrent measurements of full device stacks in which we used mixed SAMs as the hole-transport layer (see methods) revealed a similar trend. Both BZS and 4CH 3 -BZS resulted in slower photocurrent decay, whereas 4Cl-BZS treatment led to faster photocurrent decay (Fig.  2F ). This observation suggested that electron extraction became more efficient. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) revealed an increased conduction band offset with C 60 that was caused by a Fermi-level upshift after BZS and 4CH 3 -BZS treatment, whereas 4Cl-BZS caused a Fermi-level downshift and reduced conduction band offset (figs. S8 and S9). This trend was further confirmed by kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurements (fig.  S10  and table S2 ) and DFT calculations (fig.  S11 ). 
 Inverted perovskite solar cells Using 4Cl-BZS-treated perovskite, we fabricated inverted PSCs with the structure FTO/SAMs/ perovskite/C 60 /SnO x /Ag (Fig.  3A ). The thickness of the perovskite layer was 900 nm. Con-trol devices had a PCE of 24%, whereas the 4Cl-BZS-treated devices exhibited a PCE of 26.3% (fig.  S12 ). Analysis of device statistics for both control and 4Cl-BZS-treated PSCs revealed a substantial enhancement in PCE, primarily by increased open-circuit voltage (V OC ). Additionally, 4Cl-BZS-treated PSCs showed a much higher FF compared with BZS-and 4CH 3 -BZS-treated PSCs. We attribute this improvement in FF to enhanced charge extraction in 4Cl-BZStreated PSCs (Fig.  3B   
 and figs. S13 and S14). We also evaluated the effectiveness of the additive change with a stronger or weaker donating group, namely 4F-BZS, 4Br-BZS, and 4I-BZS. Notably, 4F-BZS exhibits a more-negative averaged electrostatic potential, whereas 4I-BZS displays a more-positive averaged electrostatic potential (fig.  S15 ). We posit that a stronger donating group, such as Cl or F, is beneficial in providing dual-site defect passivation. Because 4F-BZS, 4Cl-BZS, and 4I-BZS are not readily available, we used the structurally similar molecules 4-fluorobenzenesufonic acid (4F-BZSA) and 4-iodobenzenesufonic acid (4I-BZSA) in our devices (fig.  S16 ). Notably, treatments with 4F-BZSA resulted in comparable PCE as in the RESEARCH | RESEARCH ARTICLE case of 4Cl-BZS, and 4I-BZSA also showed an improved PCE compared with controls. We then added the bimolecular surface passivation (BMP) approach, based on 3-(methylthio) propylamine hydroiodide (3MTPAI) and propane-1,3 diammonium iodide (PDAI 2 ), reported in  (8) . This strategy has been reported to provide a combination of chemical and field-effect passivation (see methods). The PLQY of full-device stacks (FTO/SAMs/perovskite/BMP/C 60 ) indicated a further improvement after the BMP treatment (fig.  S17 ). The combined treatment increased the PCE of 4Cl-BZS-treated devices from 26.3 to 26.9% and featured a V OC of 1.18 V, FF of 86.2%, and short-circuit current density (J SC ) of 26.4 mA cm -2 (Fig.  3C ). Statistics of photovoltaic parameters for devices with bimolecular passivation revealed additional improvements in both V OC and PCE (fig.  S18 ). The bandgap of the pin PSCs was taken from external quantum efficiency measurements as 1.53 eV (figs. S19 and S20). We sent devices with active areas of 0.05 and 1.04 cm 2 to a National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)-accredited independent photovoltaic calibration laboratory (Newport) for certification. The devices achieved certified stabilized quasisteady state (QSS) PCEs of 26.15 and 24.74%, respectively (Fig.  3, D  and E , and figs. S21 and S22). These reported pin PSC PCEs surpass the record nip device performance reported in recent years (Fig.  3E  and tables S3 and S4). Next, we sought to test the thermal stability of the 4Cl-BZS-treated PSCs following protocols established by the International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS)  
 RESEARCH | RESEARCH ARTICLE protocol ISOS-D-2I, in which encapsulated devices were subjected to dark storage at 85°C and tested periodically. 4Cl-BZS-treated PSCs retained 95% of their initial efficiency after 1500 hours of storage at 85°C (Fig.  3G ). To evaluate operating stability further, we then also carried out ISOS-L-3 testing, in which encapsulated devices were subjected to continuous 1-sun equivalent illumination using a ultraviolet-free white light-emitting diode (LED) and held at the maximum power point (MPP) voltage, at 50% relative humidity and a heatsink temperature of 65°C (Fig.  3H ). 4Cl-BZS-treated PSCs achieved a T 95 (the time it takes for the device's PCE to drop to 95% of the initial value) of 1200 hours after continuous MPP tracking at 65°C, whereas control devices dropped from an initial efficiency of 22 to 18.7% after 1200 hours (table  S5 ). Furthermore, 4Cl-BZS-treated PSCs achieved a T 87 of 540 hours after continuous MPP tracking at 85°C (fig.  23 ). 
 Discussion We began this study with the view that dense packing of passivator ligands perpendicular to the perovskite-C 60 interface may increase resistance and that this could potentially be addressed by instead introducing ligands prone to align in a planar orientation relative to the perovskite surface. The interaction of 4Cl-BZS with undercoordinated Pb 2+ ions reduces the surface defect density and minimizes the energetic mismatch between the perovskite and C 60 . Our study indicates that the approach was effective in increasing pin PSC performance, bringing it into the range of that achieved in the nip configuration. Our approach retains the benefits of the 65°C 1-sun MPP operating stability seen in pin PSCs. To test whether our approach worked in a range of perovskite compositions, we fabricated 4Cl-BZS-treated 1.78-eV wide-bandgap mixed halide devices as well as 1.25-eV narrowbandgap mixed Pb-Sn PSCs, which are compositions of interest in all-perovskite tandem solar cells. In each case, we observed an increase in PCE after 4Cl-BZS treatment (fig.  S24 ).

The solution was stirred in the ice water for 2 hours, followed by rotary evaporation at 50˚C until the white solid was obtained which was washed with diethyl ether several times. Finally, the product was dried in a vacuum drying oven to obtain the corresponding ammonium halide salts. 
 Perovskite precursor solutions Normal bandgap perovskite. 1.67 M Cs0.05MA0.1FA0.85PbI3 perovskite precursors were prepared by dissolving 0.075 mmol CsI, 0.15 mmol MAI, 1.275 mmol FAI, and 1.5 mmol PbI2 in 0.9 mL mixed DMF and DMSO solution (745 μL DMF + 155 μL DMSO), 15 mg MACl and 35 mg PbI2 were added to improve the quality of perovskite films, and these may contribute positively to the anchoring of additives by providing adequate Pb 2+ sites. The precursor solutions were stirred at 60 ˚C for 1 h and then filtered using a 0.22 polytetrafluoroethylene membrane before use. In studies comparing different additives, we used 1 mg ml -1 concentration for all additives to determine which additive provided the greatest improvement (4Cl-BZS). We then optimized the concentration of 4Cl-BZS, testing 0.5, 1, and 2 mg ml -1 , finding that 1 mg ml -1 is the best concentration for 4Cl-BZS. Wide bandgap (WBG) perovskite. 1.2 M wide-band gap perovskite precursor solution with a composition of FA0.8Cs0.2Pb(I0.6Br0.38)3 with 5% mol MAPbCl3 additive was prepared by dissolving CsI, FAI, PbBr2, PbI2 MACl and PbCl2 in mixed solvents of DMF and DMSO with a volume ratio of 4:1. 0.5 mg 4Cl-BZS chemical was added into 1 mL WBG precursor for 4Cl-BZStreated WBG device fabrication.

The precursor solution was then stirred at room temperature for 1 h. The precursor solution was filtered using a 0.22 μm Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane before using. 
 Solar cell fabrication Single-junction normal bandgap device. Prepatterned Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glasses were cleaned using acetone and isopropanol each for 20 min in an ultrasonic bath, followed by ultraviolet ozone treatment for 30 min. The hole transport layer (HTL) was fabricated by using the mixed SAM solution of 2PACz and Me-4PACz in a glovebox. The 2PACz concentration is 0.17 mg ml -1 and Me-4PACz concentration is 0.33 mg ml -1 . The SAM in ethanol solution was spincoated on FTO at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s, followed by annealing at 120℃ for 10 min. The perovskite solutions were spin-coated at 1000 r.p.m for 10 s (acceleration rate 500 r.p.m./s) and 5000 r.p.m. for 35 s (acceleration rate 1000 r.p.m./s), respectively. At the last 15 s of the second step, 150 μL anisole was dropped as antisolvent. The films were then annealed at 120°C for 10 min. For the bimolecular passivation (BMP) treatment, 12 mM 3MTPAI and 6 mM PDAI2 was dissolved in 1 mL isopropanol/chlorobenzene (1:1 v/v) solvent and filtered before use, 120 μL mixed solution was spin-coated on the perovskite films at 4000 r.p.m for 25 s, followed by annealing at 100°C for 5 min. After cooling down to room temperature, the substrates were transferred to the evaporation system and a 25 nm C60 film was subsequently deposited on top by thermal evaporation at a rate of 0.2 A s -1 , after finishing the C60 deposition, the substrates were then transferred to the atomic layer deposition (ALD) system (Picosun) to deposit 20 nm SnO2 at 90 º C using precursors of tetrakis(dimethylamino) tin (iv) (99.9999%) and deionized water. Finally, 140 nm Ag electrode was evaporated by thermal evaporation. Single junction wide bandgap perovskite solar cells. NiOx nanocrystal (5 mg ml -1 in H2O and 2-Propanol mixed solvent with volume ratio of 3:1) layers were first spin-coated on ITO substrates at 3,000 rpm for 25 s in air without any post-treatment, then the substrates were immediately transferred to the glovebox. The NiOx nanoparticles were prepared via the hydrolysis reaction of nickel nitrate referring to our previous work  (3) . Me-4PACz (0.5 mg ml -1 ) in ethanol was spincoated on the NiOx film at 3,000 rpm for 25 s and then annealed at 100 o C for 10 min. For the perovskite film fabrication, the substrate was spun at 4000 rpm for 32 s with an acceleration of 1000 rpm, 100 μL Anisole was dropped onto the substrate during the last 8 s of the spinning. The substrates were then transferred onto a hotplate and heated at 100 °C for 15 min. For electron transport layer (ETL), 25 nm C60 was thermally evaporated on the perovskite films at a rate of 0.2 A s -1 under a high vacuum of ~10 -7 Torr, followed by 7 nm BCP evaporation as a hole-blocking layer. Finally, 140 nm Ag electrode was evaporated by thermal evaporation. Single junction Pb-Sn perovskite solar cells. PEDOT: PSS was spin-coated on ITO substrates at 6,000 rpm for 30 s and annealed on a hotplate at 160 °C for 20 min in ambient air. After cooling, we transferred the substrates immediately to a nitrogen-filled glovebox for the deposition of perovskite films. The perovskite films were deposited with a two-step spin-coating procedure: (1) 1,000 rpm for 10 s with an acceleration of 200 rpm s -1 , (2) 3800 rpm for 45s with an acceleration of 1000 rpm s -1 , 300 µl CB was dropped onto the spinning substrate during the second spin-coating step at 20 s before the end of the procedure. The substrates were then treated on hotplate for 10 min at 100 o C. 25 nm C60, 7 nm BCP and 140 nm Ag were sequentially deposited on top of the perovskite layer by thermal evaporation. Device testing. The current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under illumination from a solar simulator (Newport, Class A) with a light intensity of 100 mW cm -2 (checked with a calibrated reference solar cell from Newport). The J-V curves were measured in a nitrogen atmosphere with a scanning rate of 100 mV s -1 (voltage step of 10 mV and delay time of 200 ms). The active area was determined by the aperture shade mask (0.049 cm 2 for small-area devices, 1.04 cm 2 for large-area devices) placed in front of the solar cell. A spectral mismatch factor of 1.0 was used for all J-V measurements. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured in ambient air using the solar-cell-spectra-response measurement system (QE-R, EnliTech). Stability testing. Devices were placed in a homemade stability-tracking station. The illumination source is a UV-free white-light LED with its intensity calibrated to match 1-Sun conditions. The spectrum of the white-light LED simulator used in MPP stability tracking is in Supplementary Fig.  33  of our previous work  (26) . For the ISOS-L-3 ageing test, the device chamber was left open in a room with 50 ± 10% relative humidity, and the solar cell was mounted on a metal plate kept at 65 ˚C using a heating element. A thermal couple attached to the metal plate was used to monitor and provide feedback control to the heating element to ensure temperature consistency. For thermal stability tests, the encapsulated cells were heated at 85℃ in nitrogen. The device performance was evaluated periodically. Encapsulation was performed using a capping glass slide, with ultraviolet-adhesive (Lumtec LT-U001) as sealant. Crystallographic characterizations. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were measured on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer at room temperature using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 A) at 40 kV and 40 mA. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray Scattering (GIWAXS) was conducted on perovskite films at the Brockhouse X-ray Diffraction and Scattering Sector Low Energy Wiggler (BXDS-WLE) beamline of the Canadian Light Source (CLS) using a photon energy of 15.12 keV (λ = 0.82 Å). A Rayonix MX300 detector 328.04 mm away from the sample was used for collecting patterns. Other characterizations. NMR spectra were recorded by Bruker Avance III HD500. Time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) was collected by IONTOF M6 instrument using a primary 30 keV Bi ion source with an analysis area of 50 × 50 μm 2 . SEM images were collected by JEOL JSM-7900FLV microscope using a 5 keV and 10 keV electron beam for surface and cross-section images, respectively. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were carried out using a Horiba Fluorolog time-correlated single photon counting system with photomultiplier tube detectors. A pulsed laser diode (634 nm, 110-140 ps pulse width) was used as the excitation source for steady-state and transient measurements. The luminescence quantum yield was measured by a LuQY Pro System (Quantum Yield Berlin) under the excitation of 532 nm laser (100 mW). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) were performed on Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi with an X-ray spot size of 500 μm. The XPS instrument was calibrated using silver metal, with the Ag 3d5/2 peak set at 368.2 eV. The sampling depth is 10 nm, and the spectrum remains unaffected by the underlying substrate. Throughout the XPS analysis, a low-energy electron gun was employed to flood the analysis area, neutralizing surface charges. In the post-processing phase, we standardized the adventitious carbon peak at 284.8 eV to calibrate all spectra and mitigate surface charging effects. We utilized an XPS optical microscope and observed particle aggregation on the substrate. The Xray spot, with a diameter of 400 µm, was precisely focused on an aggregated region with a thickness of several micrometers. The influence of the underlying substrate should be omitted from the analysis. Each sample was connected to the grounded sample holder using copper conductive tape. Additionally, charge compensation was performed prior to each measurement. Transient photocurrent (TPC) was conducted by the Fluxim Paios system. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) images were generated using an Asylum Cypher S atomic force microscope (Oxford Instruments) with a Ti-Ir-coated ASYELEC.01-R2 cantilever and k = 4 ± 0.5 N m -1 (Asylum Research). Scans were performed over 2 µm at 512 pixels and 0.5 Hz in a two-pass nap method, the first pass in tapping mode and the second in KPFM mode with a tip potential of 5 V and surface clearance of 5 nm. NMR analysis. We find (Fig.  S6A ) that C1 connecting the SO3 -unit shows the largest chemical shift. This we attribute to electron-withdrawal from the substituent. C4, located at the para position, shows the second largest chemical shift, which we assign to the conjugating effect. After the introduction of PbI2, the chemical shift of C1 moves to a higher field (-0.4), which we ascribe to the decrease of the electron-withdrawing capability of the substituent following coordination with PbI2. In contrast, the C4 peak shifts to a lower field (+0.  22 ), which we ascribe to the enhancement of the conjugating effect after the coordination of SO3 -and PbI2  (40, 41) . Similar changes are observed for the methyl-substituted molecule (Fig.  S6B ). The change of the chemical shift is indicative of the strong interaction between SO3 -and PbI2. For the molecule with chlorine substituent Cl-BZS-PbI2, the change of the chemical shift of C1 and C4 after the interaction with PbI2 is reduced (-0.36, +0.1), indicating that the chlorine atom influences the electron density of the carbon atoms. To study the effect of the chlorine substituent in particular, we studied the NMR spectrum of chlorine benzene. As shown in Fig.  S6D , the peak of C4 connecting to the chlorine atom moves to a higher field after the addition of PbI2 (-0.09). This can be ascribed to the interaction between chlorine and PbI2 that reduces the electronwithdrawing character. The peak of C1 moves to lower field due to the enhancement of the conjugating effect (+0.03). These shifts indicate interactions between the chlorine and lead, as expected. For the molecule with both chlorine and SO3 -substituents (Fig.  S6C ), the movement of the chemical shift is reduced compared to BZS-PbI2, and the overall movement of the peak position in 4Cl-BZS+PbI2 is almost consistent with the sums of the shifts observed for single SO3 -and Cl substituents  (42) . This indicates the interaction of both SO3 -and Cl with PbI2. First-principles calculations. First-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) were carried out using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)  (43) . For the exchange-correlation functional, the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional (PBE) (44) was adopted. DFT-D3 method was used for the van der Waals (vdW) correction  (45) . Dipole corrections were taken into consideration in the work function calculations. The plane-wave cutoff energy was 400 eV. The energy and force convergence criteria were set to 10 -5 eV and 0.03 eV• Å -1 , respectively. The adsorption energies (Eads) of C60 with different molecules (BZS, 4CH3-BZS and 4Cl-BZS) adsorbed perovskite surface were calculated as E(C60@perovskite)-E(C60)-E(perovskite). The electrostatic potentials (φ) of the passivators were calculated in the Gaussian 09 package at the B3LYP/def2TZVP level with DFT-D3.                      The lifetime extraction from the bi-exponential equation is carried out using the following equation: 𝜏 𝑎𝑣𝑒 = ∑ 𝐴 𝑖 𝜏 𝑖 2 ∑ 𝐴 𝑖 𝜏 𝑖 where 𝜏 𝑎𝑣𝑒 is the average lifetime, 𝐴 𝑖 and 𝜏 𝑖 are amplitudes and decay times, respectively; the shorter lifetime 𝜏 1 is the decay time of trap-mediated recombination, the longer lifetime 𝜏 2 is the decay time of radiative recombination (citation).
