<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Many experimental methods are available for the characterization of nanostructures, but most of them are limited by stringent experimental conditions. When it comes to analysing nanostructures in the bulk or in their natural environment -even as ordinary as water at room temperature -smallangle scattering (SAS) of X-rays or neutrons is often the only option. The rapid worldwide development of synchrotron and neutron facilities over recent decades has opened unprecedented possibilities for using SAS in situ and in a time-resolved way. But, in spite of its huge potential in the field of nanomaterials in general, SAS is covered far less than other characterization methods in nonspecialized curricula. Presented here is a rigorous discussion of small-angle scattering, at a technical level comparable to the classical undergraduate coverage of X-ray diffraction by crystals and which contains diffraction as a particular case.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>A major difficulty when working with nanostructuressynthesizing them, manipulating them, studying their properties etc. -is that we cannot see them with the naked eye. Or when we can, e.g. using electron microscopy, the observation conditions are very different from the sample's natural conditions. Frozen, desiccated or metallized nanostructures in an electron beam may have little in common with their natural state swollen in water, undergoing thermal motion and surrounded by all types of ions. Moreover, the amount of material characterized in any microscopy observation is so small that one can always doubt whether it is representative of the sample as a whole. In many situations, therefore, workers in the field of nanomaterials have to rely on indirect characterization methods, whereby a macroscopic amount of sample is analysed in its normal environment but only incomplete structural information is obtained. Small-angle scattering (SAS) is such a method.</p><p>In its principle, SAS is very similar to better-known diffraction experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Guinier &amp; Fournet, 1955;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Glatter &amp; Kratky, 1982)</ref>. In its most popular form, an X-ray (small-angle X-ray scattering, SAXS) or neutron (small-angle neutron scattering, SANS) beam is shone on a sample and the intensity of the scattered beam is measured downstream as a function of the angle [Fig. <ref type="bibr">1(a)</ref>]. Accurate measurement of scattering at angles lower than a few degrees poses specific experimental difficulties <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Schmatz et al., 1974)</ref>. In the present discussion, however, we focus on the principle of the method and on the structural significance of the measured signal. From that perspective, the main difference from diffraction experiments is that the angles investigated with SAS are much shallower. To some extent, SAS can be thought of as the analysis of the fine structure of what might be considered as the transmitted ISSN 1600-5767 beam in a typical diffraction experiment. In order to resolve small scattering angles experimentally, the detector must generally be positioned far away from the sample, so SAS instruments are generally large [Figs. <ref type="bibr">1(b)</ref>  <ref type="table"></ref>and<ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1(c)]</ref>.</p><p>The physical principles underlying the SAS signal are sketched in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2</ref>. In the case of X-rays, any electron met by the incoming beam is accelerated by its oscillating electric field, and this results in the emission of secondary electromagnetic waves with identical frequency. In the case of SANS, the incoming neutrons interact with nuclei present in the sample via the strong nuclear force, and the scattering is a quantum-mechanical effect concerning the wavefunctions of both neutron and atomic nuclei. In the context of the Born approximation <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Squires, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Loh, 2017)</ref>, however, each nucleus met by the neutron beam can also be thought of as the source of a secondary wavefunction. Therefore, although the physics of X-ray and neutron scattering are quite different, their geometric aspects can be discussed in terms of the same classical Huygens-like description of wave propagation in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2</ref>. In both cases, the intensity measured on the detector results from the interference of all secondary waves as a function of the scattering angle . Analysing SAS patterns consists of inferring structural information from the thusmeasured intensities.</p><p>Although SAXS can be measured on commercial laboratory instruments, users of the technique also benefit from the worldwide development of large-scale facilities such as synchrotrons and free-electron lasers, many of which have instruments dedicated to small-angle scattering. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">3</ref> testifies to the booming of the field over the past few decades. Historically, starting from the 1960s, first-generation synchrotrons were particle accelerators built for physics research. As a consequence of the acceleration of charged particles, these instruments inevitably produced X-rays, but this was largely considered a nuisance. Second-generation synchrotrons were particle accelerators deliberately built as intense X-ray sources for characterization studies. From approximately 1990 to 2010, the worldwide development of optimized third-generation synchrotrons took place at the (a) A sketch of the main elements in a typical small-angle scattering instrument.

Since the 1960s, the brilliance of synchrotron sources has tripled every eighteen months <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Rubensson, 2016)</ref>, so that current synchrotron beams are billions of times more intense than X-rays emitted by, say, rotating anodes. In addition to higher intensity, synchrotron beams are also more coherent, better focused, with a broader energy spectrum available etc., which enables a wealth of scattering experiments that are impossible on laboratory sources. The difference between synchrotron and laboratory X-rays is often likened to the difference between a laser and a light bulb.</p><p>Comparable progress has taken place in the field of neutron facilities, which developed at a fast pace all through the second half of the 20th century, based on both nuclear reactors and spallation sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Rush, 2015)</ref>. A major event in the field is the current development of the European Spallation Source, anticipated to become the most brilliant neutron source worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Santoro et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Andersen et al., 2020)</ref>. The increasing number of facilities and brilliance of the sources has been accompanied by qualitative improvements in the instrumentation, with better optics, detectors, instrument control, data analysis tools etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Koch, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Andersen et al., 2020)</ref> The fields of application of SAS are extremely numerous as it can in principle be applied to study any nanoscale system. The following are just a few examples, which are inevitably biased towards the authors' scientific interests. Among others, SAS is routinely used to analyse nanostructures in solution, which is invaluable for colloids and proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Tuukkanen et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gra ¨wert &amp; Svergun, 2020)</ref>. Nanostructures can also be analysed in working conditions, while materials are being mechanically deformed <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Pawlak &amp; Galeski, 2005)</ref> or submitted to a variety of thermal, chemical or electromagnetic stimuli <ref type="bibr">(Bailey, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hamley et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fujii et al., 2012)</ref>. Nanostructures can also be studied under extreme experimental conditions. Spectacular examples are the in situ analysis of nanostructured soot formation in flames (di <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Stasio et al., 2006)</ref> and fireball lightning <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Mitchell et al., 2008)</ref>. SAS also enables biochemical structures and processes to be studied in biological tissues in vivo at the nanometre scale, such as the spinning of spider silk <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Riekel &amp; Vollrath, 2001)</ref> or muscle contraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ait-Mou et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>The availability of different types of beams for performing SAS experiments adds to the versatility of the method. In addition to X-rays and neutrons, scattering experiments can also be done with electrons, visible light or muons (obtained as by-products of neutrons in spallation sources) <ref type="bibr">(Windsor, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Pynn, 1990)</ref>. The various probes differ in the sample characteristics they are sensitive to, yielding different types of contrasts. In the case of neutrons, this capability is further expanded through the possibility of isotope substitution. Another important characteristic of a probe is its penetration depth, which may enable or forbid certain types of experiment. The different brilliance of the sources is also central for choosing a probe for time-resolved studies etc. Often, different types of scattering technique are combined, each of which provides different and complementary information on the investigated system. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Allen et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Whitten &amp; Trewhella, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Genix &amp; Oberdisse, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Despite its huge potential as a characterization technique for nanostructures in general -across the fields of chemistry, physics, biology and materials science -SAS remains relatively unpopular in most scientific curricula compared with other experimental methods. This is partly due to its reputation as a very indirect technique, the thorough understanding of which requires a strong taste for mathematics. The aim of the present paper is to show that most SAS data can be analysed qualitatively, yet rigorously, with minimal mathematical background.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Structural significance of small-angle scattering</head><p>For reasons that will soon be clear, SAS intensities are plotted not against the scattering angle but against the magnitude of the scattering wavevector q, defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">q ¼ 4 sin 2 ;<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>where is the wavelength of the X-rays or neutrons. The physical meaning of q is that hq is the momentum transfer to the photon or neutron during the scattering event. In the context of diffraction studies, the scattering angle is sometimes defined as 2 instead of . In that context, q is therefore defined as being proportional to sin(), but this is the same physical quantity. Among other advantages, scattering patterns plotted against q are independent of the particular wavelength selected for the experiment, which would not be the case if they were plotted against . Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref> displays four data sets that are representative of qualitatively different types of scattering pattern that one often encounters when applying SAS. For now, we only highlight their most distinctive features, which we will discuss and explain in detail in the rest of the paper. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>(a) is a SAXS pattern measured on ordered nanoporous silica, consisting of a hexagonal array of cylindrical pores a few nanometres across <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gommes et al., 2016)</ref>. The scattering peaks can be interpreted in terms of diffraction by the periodic pore structure, but with a periodicity in the nanometre range corresponding to the distance between the pores. Many materials do not exhibit periodicity on the nanometre scale and their SAS patterns do not exhibit any sharp peak. One such pattern is plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>(b), which was measured by SANS on an aqueous colloidal suspension of latex nanoparticles <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hammouda, 1995)</ref>. The pattern seems featureless on linear scales, except for a slight hump around q = 0.01 A ˚À1 . On teaching and education logarithmic scales, however, the scattered intensity exhibits a plateau at small q, followed by an oscillatory decrease. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>(c) displays a SAXS pattern obtained by shining a synchrotron beam through a laboratory model of fireball lightning <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Mitchell et al., 2008)</ref>. The SAXS pattern is dominated by an I ' q À4 trend at large values of q, which appears as linear on the double logarithmic scales of the inset. The last pattern [Fig. <ref type="bibr">4(d)</ref>] was obtained by neutron scattering on a 50:50% blend of deuterated and protonated polystyrene, which provides strong scattering contrast to half of the polymer chains <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hammouda, 1995)</ref>. This pattern too exhibits an overall power-law scattering that levels off towards smaller values of q, but the scattering exponent is here close to 2.</p><p>In the context of scattering, it is difficult for anybody with a scientific education not to think of Bragg's law, and this can be misleading in the context of SAS. Bragg's law is concerned with diffraction, which is a very specific scattering phenomenon that happens only with periodic structures. In that case, the beam is scattered exclusively at well defined diffraction angles d , which are related to the periodicities d of the structure via <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Sivia, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Loh, 2017)</ref> 2d sin</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">d 2 ¼ n;<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>where n is any positive integer. Before discussing SAS, it is important to emphasize that Bragg's law is not a general law of scattering but a consequence of the general principles of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2</ref>, when particularized to spatially periodic structures. In the specific case of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>(a), one can use equation <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref> to infer the spacing between pores from the positions of the peaks, but we shall see that the scattering pattern contains much more structural information than that. Moreover, equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) is irrelevant and useless in cases of non-periodic structures, such as in Figs. <ref type="bibr">4(b)-4(d)</ref>.</p><p>Analysing from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2</ref> the general conditions for destructive or constructive interference of all secondary waves when they reach the detector, in relation to all possible sizes and shapes of the electron-or nucleus-containing nanostructures, may seem at first to be a difficult task. The following two observations make it simpler. First, under the conditions of SAS the emission of secondary waves can be assumed to be isotropic <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Glatter &amp; Kratky, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Sivia, 2011)</ref>. Second, provided the sample is sufficiently thin the secondary waves reach the detector without being scattered a second time <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Frielinghaus, 2018)</ref>, so it is only the unperturbed incoming beam that is responsible for the secondary waves. As a consequence, for any given scattering angle , that is for a given pixel of the detector, the phase of a specific secondary wave reaching the detector depends only on the position (x, y, z) of the scattering centre. In other words, for any given angle one can calculate a phase map (x, y, z) which is a characteristic of the instrument. That function is the phase of the secondary wave that would reach the detector in the event that the sample had a scattering centre at a point (x, y, z). The scattered intensity is then obtained as a second step, by comparing the sampleindependent phase map (x, y, z) with the actual spatial distribution of electrons or nuclei in the considered sample. The phase map can be thought of as the spectacles through which any sample is analysed in a SAS experiment. It is therefore occasionally referred to as the probe wave <ref type="bibr">(Windsor, 1988)</ref>. The phase map is different for each scattering angle, which is why a full scattering pattern measured over a wide angular range provides rich structural information.</p><p>Calculating the phase map for a given angle (x, y, z) is a purely geometric question. Starting from any given point Representative SAS patterns. (a) SAXS of ordered mesoporous silica <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gommes et al., 2016)</ref>, (b) SANS of a colloidal suspension of latex nanoparticles <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hammouda, 1995)</ref>, (c) SAXS of a laboratory model of fireball lightning <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Mitchell et al., 2008)</ref>, and (d) SANS of a blend of deuterated and protonated polystyrene <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hammouda, 1995)</ref>. The insets show the same data on double logarithmic scales and compare them with power laws of the type I ' q À4 and I ' q À2 . Qualitative sketches of the structures are provided at the top.</p><p>(x, y, z) two half lines are drawn, one towards the source and the other towards the detector. Their lengths are the distances travelled by the primary and secondary waves, respectively. Let us call the sum of the two lengths L(x, y, z). Because the scattering is instantaneous and the phase of a wave increases by a quantity 2 each time the wave travels a distance equal to its wavelength , the phase map is obtained by multiplying L(x, y, z) by 2/. The calculation of L(x, y, z) is explained in Appendix A on the basis of simple trigonometry. The result is sketched in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref>: the phase map (x, y, z) is found to take constant values on geometric planes oriented at an angle /2 with respect to the incident beam. As a consequence, the phase depends only on the space coordinate perpendicular to the planes, which we call y. With that convention, the result is written as ðx; y; zÞ</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">¼ 0 þ qy:<label>ð3Þ</label></formula><p>Here 0 is an irrelevant constant that depends on the arbitrarily chosen origin of y, and q is the same as in equation <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref>. Equation <ref type="bibr">(3)</ref> shows that (x, y, z) increases by 2 over a distance Ã given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Ã ¼ 2 q :<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><p>The notation Ã highlights the fact that this length plays the role of an apparent, and -dependent, wavelength. For SAS one can approximate sin(/2) ' /2 in the definition of q, so that Ã is approximately inversely proportional to the scattering angle, Ã ' /, with expressed in radians. In other words, the smaller the angle, the larger the size of the investigated objects. For X-rays and thermal neutrons with in the a ˚ngstro ¨m range, a typical angle of 1 ' 0.017 rad converts to Ã ' 6 nm. This is the reason why small-angle scattering is a suitable experimental technique to probe nanometre-scaled structures.</p><p>The concept of a phase map shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref>, together with its quantitative relation to the observation angle in equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>), is all that is needed for a qualitative understanding of SAS. Before proceeding, however, another caveat is necessary. Although Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref> superficially resembles the classical textbook discussions of Bragg's law -where the crystal lattice planes are indeed parallel to each other and oriented at an angle of /2 with respect to the incoming beam -the planes we are dealing with here are by no means material planes. They are the geometric locus of points that would lead to secondary waves reaching the detector in phase, in the event that the considered sample had scattering centres (electrons or nuclei) there.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Scattering by individual particles: the form factor</head><p>We consider a single nanoparticle irradiated by X-rays and a detector at some angle , but the discussion also holds for neutrons, provided electrons are replaced by nuclei. The particle is assumed to be homogeneous so that the number of electrons per unit volume is the same everywhere in it. If the particle is made of silica, for example, every cubic nanometre of it contains about 700 electrons. Each of these electrons is the source of a secondary wave, which is described as a complex number a exp(i) when it reaches the detector. The amplitude a is the same for all electrons, but the phase depends on the electron position through (x, y, z). The amplitude A of the resulting wave is the sum of the contributions of all electrons in the particle, namely</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">A ¼ a 1 exp ði 1 Þ þ a 2 exp ði 2 Þ þ Á Á Á :<label>ð5Þ</label></formula><p>This sum has a simple geometric interpretation in the complex plane, whereby each term is associated with an arrow of length a and angle , which are then added head-to-tail. This type of analysis goes back to the early introduction of complex numbers into optics by Fresnel <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Karam, 2018)</ref> and was popularized notably by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Feynman (1985)</ref> in his lectures on quantum electrodynamics. Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">5</ref>) may apply to all electrons individually, in which case all a values are equal, but it is more convenient to calculate the sum by grouping the contributions of electrons with identical phases, which are all located within slices oriented at an angle /2 with respect to the incoming beam (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref>). With such a procedure, and assuming that equal volumes of material contain equal numbers of electrons, equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">5</ref>) still applies with a proportional to the volume of the slice and equal to the constant value of within the slice.

Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">6</ref>) is valid for neutron scattering as well, provided the electron density is replaced by the neutron scattering-length density, which characterizes how strongly the nuclei that make up the particle interact with neutrons <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Pynn, 1990)</ref>. Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">6</ref>) is usually stated by saying that the scattered intensity is the squared modulus of the Fourier transform of a material's electron density. Although this may sound mathematically advanced, many aspects of it can be understood qualitatively yet rigorously from the simpler perspective of equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">5</ref>), through the geometric interpretation of complex numbers in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_32">6</ref>. For small values of q, the periodicity of the phase map Ã = 2/q is much larger than the size of the particle, so that all scattering centres of the particle scatter in phase. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_32">6</ref>, this would correspond to a situation where all the arrows point in the same direction, which maximizes the scattered intensity. By contrast, for large values of q the length Ã is smaller than the particle, so that different parts of the particle scatter out of phase. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_32">6</ref> this corresponds to arrows pointing in different directions, which results in a lower scattered intensity. This simple analysis explains the overall shape of most scattering patterns in the insets of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>: they are globally decreasing functions with a plateau at small q, and the transition occurs where 2/q is comparable to the size of the scattering objects.</p><p>The intensity I(q) scattered by an individual nanoparticle over a complete range of q is referred to as its form factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Pynn, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Sivia, 2011)</ref> and constitutes its SAS fingerprint.

This is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> for a given sphere and three different values of q. In the figure, the sphere is cut into slices with uniform phases and the corresponding amplitudes are added to form a meandering curve in the complex plane. The case of Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>(a) is relatively similar to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_32">6</ref>. It is representative of low-q scattering, where all points of the sphere lead to secondary waves with similar phases. When q is progressively increased, destructive interference builds up, whereby different parts of the sphere lead to distinctly different phases. This corresponds to a curve that curls in the complex plane. For the specific value q ' 4.5/R the curling is such that the curve closes head-to-tail, which is the origin of the first minimum [Fig. <ref type="bibr">7(b)</ref>]. Increasing q further, the end of the curve moves away from its starting point, until a maximum is reached corresponding to Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>(c) etc. A movie is provided as supporting information to illustrate this in an animated way.</p><p>If the nanoparticles in a sample do not all have the same exact size or shape, the conditions for constructive and destructive interference differ from one particle to the next. Therefore, the presence of sharp oscillations in an experimental SAS pattern testifies to a narrow size distribution. This situation contrasts with Figs. <ref type="bibr">4(c) or 4(d)</ref>, which exhibit a scattered intensity that decreases continuously with q, as is typical of polydisperse systems. When plotted on double logarithmic scales (inset) the scattered intensities display two regimes: a plateau at low q followed by a decreasing intensity, with the transition happening for Ã comparable to the particle size. From equation <ref type="bibr">(6)</ref> it can be shown that, for a single particle, the progressive onset of destructive interference for small values of q obeys a universal law that is independent of the particle shape, namely <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Guinier &amp; Fournet, 1955;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Glatter &amp; Kratky, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Feigin &amp; Svergun, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Sivia, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Jaksch, 2019)</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_9">PðqÞ ' exp ÀðqR G Þ 2 =3 Â Ã ;<label>ð9Þ</label></formula><p>where R G is the radius of gyration of the particle.

Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">9</ref>) is known as Guinier's law, and it provides a universal and modelindependent way of determining particle sizes from SAS data. Plotting experimental scattering data as ln½IðqÞ against q 2 often yields a linear trend at low q, the slope of which is ÀR 2 G =3. Assuming specific types of structures, the R G thus obtained can then be converted to more intuitive measures of the particle size. For example, the radius of a sphere is R = (5/3) 1/2 R G ; the length of a rod is L = 2(3 1/2 )R G ; in a linear polymer chain with segments of length b, the number of segments is N ¼ 6R 2 G =b 2 etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Glatter &amp; Kratky, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Sivia, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to sizes, qualitative structural information is obtained by analysing the building up of destructive interference when q is increased beyond the limit of validity of equation <ref type="bibr">(9)</ref>, that is when the periodicity of the phase map Ã is made smaller than the particle size. This typically leads to power laws of the type I ' q À , which can easily be identified as straight lines with slope À on double logarithmic plots. In the insets of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref> the scattering exponent is = 4 for the first three samples and = 2 for the last one. The specific exponent 4 is referred to as Porod's law and is universal to all structures with clear-cut interfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ciccariello et al., 1988)</ref>. Porod scattering was expected in the case of the nanoporous solid in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>(a), as well as that of the colloidal particles in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">4(b)</ref>. However, its experimental observation in the case of the fireballs [Fig. <ref type="bibr">4(c)</ref>] is proof that they contain compact nanostructures with well defined surfaces. By contrast, the exponent 2 observed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>(d) points to a qualitatively different type of structure. Exponents close to 2 are often encountered for polymers, the structure of which on the nanometre scale consists of flexible strands folding and coiling randomly. When comparing loose and disordered structures as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">4(d</ref>) with dense and compact structures as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>(b), it is intuitively understandable why the former should lead to a slower building up of destructive interference than the latter, when q is increased.</p><p>Discussing rigorously the relation between scattering exponents and specific types of structure can only be done through the application of equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">6</ref>) to structural models. A broad array of such models are discussed in the SAS literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Pedersen, 1997)</ref>, and new models are regularly being developed each time a new type of material is encountered, with characteristics that are not captured by earlier models. Beyond the type of compact objects that universally lead to Porod scattering with exponent = 4, other structures include infinitely thin needles and platelets, fractal-like hierarchical aggregates, random flexible polymers, persistent polymers, branched polymers etc. All of these lead to specific scattering exponents, as summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Experienced users of SAS have these models in mind when they analyse experimental scattering patterns. When plotting the data on double logarithmic scales, as in the insets of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>, one can determine at a glance both the qualitative type of structure, via the exponent , and its approximate size, via the cutoff value of q where destructive interference sets in. A scattering exponent teaching and education does not point to a unique type of structure, as = 2 might point either to a polymer coil or to randomly oriented platelets. In the context of a specific type of material, however, this is seldom ambiguous.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Scattering by collections of particles: the structure factor</head><p>The discussion has focused so far on the scattering by a single particle. This has overlooked the fact that any sample contains a large number of particles, each of which contributes to the scattered intensity, with possibly constructive or destructive inter-particle interference. The contribution of a collection of particles to the scattering is captured by the structure factor, which can also be analysed through equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">5</ref>). For that purpose, the sum of the secondary waves from all electrons or nuclei in the system is decomposed into the contributions of all individual particles. The contribution of each particle is a complex number a exp(i), with an amplitude given by the form factor through |a| = V [P(q)] 1/2 and a phase that depends on the position of the particle. If all particles are identical the amplitude can be factored out from the sum, which leads to the following expression for the scattered intensity:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">IðqÞ ¼ 2 V 2 PðqÞ exp ði 1 Þ þ exp ði 2 Þ þ Á Á Á 2 :<label>ð10Þ</label></formula><p>In this equation, the phase i of the ith particle is the value of the phase map (x, y, z) at the position of, say, its centre of mass. When comparing with equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">7</ref>), the presence of many particles and their spatial distribution are found to be accounted for by an additional factor, which is generally q dependent, through the angular dependence of the phase map.</p><p>Consider first the case where particles are randomly positioned in space <ref type="bibr">[Fig. 8(a)</ref>], which is a fair approximation for dilute suspensions. In that case, the random position of each particle converts to a random orientation of its vector contribution to the wave amplitude, independent of the considered q. In other words, the amplitude of the scattered wave results from a random walk in the complex plane, whereby N successive steps are made with the same length a and random directions. As a consequence of the random orientation of each step, the average length of the walk is not proportional to the number of steps. Instead, the average squared length is proportional to N [see e.g. ch. 41 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Feynman et al. (2010)</ref>]. In the present situation, this means that the averaged squared amplitude of the wave, i.e. the scattered intensity, is equal to</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">hjAj 2 i ¼ Njaj 2 ;<label>ð11Þ</label></formula><p>where |a| 2 is the intensity scattered by a single particle, namely 2 V 2 P(q), and N is the number of particles. The scattered intensity per unit volume of the sample irradiated by X-rays can then be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">IðqÞ ¼ c 2 V 2 PðqÞ;<label>ð12Þ</label></formula><p>teaching and education</p><note type="other">Figure 8</note><p>Interference patterns resulting from multiple-particle scattering, for the cases of (a) randomly positioned particles, (b) aggregated particles, (c) particles repelling each other and (d) a hexagonal crystalline structure. In each case, a typical phase map is shown with the particles in grey. In the complex-plane representation of wave amplitude, the contribution of each particle is shown as a black arrow and the resulting wave amplitude is in red. The grey annular area is the 50% confidence interval for the wave amplitude in the case where each particle has a random phase (incoherent scattering), and the dashed circle is the root-mean-square value.</p><p>where c is the particle concentration in the suspension. Such proportionality of the intensity with the number of scatterers (or with their concentration) is typical of incoherent scattering, whereby all scatterers have uncorrelated phases. Note the difference from the form factor in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> and equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">7</ref>), for which the intensity is proportional to (V) 2 , that is to the squared number of electrons in each particle. A central characteristic of equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">12</ref>) is that the scattered intensity is proportional to the form factor, which is typical of dilute systems.</p><p>In most situations the particle positions are not independent of one another, and the random-walk analysis of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_41">8(a)</ref> [leading to equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">12</ref>)] has to be adapted. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_41">8</ref>(b) illustrates the case of particle aggregation, for aggregates with n a = 3 particles. The particular value of q chosen for the figure is such that Ã = 2/q is larger than the aggregates, so that the phases of all particles within a given aggregate are statistically similar. This results in a correlated random walk in amplitude space, whereby each step in the walk is likely to have an orientation similar to the others. This leads to more elongated trajectories and to a larger intensity of the scattered wave. This can easily be understood by considering the limit of vanishingly small q, for which Ã is much larger than the aggregates. In that limit all particles within an aggregate scatter coherently, so the length of a step is no longer a but n a a. On the other hand, aggregates themselves scatter incoherently, so it is still a random walk but with only N/n a steps. The modified version of equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">11</ref>) is then</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">hjAj 2 i ' n a Njaj 2 ;<label>ð13Þ</label></formula><p>which shows that particle aggregation results in an n a -fold increase in the scattered intensity in the limit of vanishingly small q. For finite q the multiplying factor depends on the shape and size of the aggregates. The modified version of equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">12</ref>) is then</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">IðqÞ ¼ c 2 V 2 PðqÞ SðqÞ;<label>ð14Þ</label></formula><p>where S(q) is referred to as the structure factor. The specific structure factor obtained by evaluating the sum in equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">10</ref>) for the considered type of aggregates is plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">9</ref>(a). It does indeed satisfy S = 3 for small q and converges to S = 1 for large q, and the transition occurs when Ã is comparable to the size of the aggregates. When Ã is much smaller than the aggregates, the phases of the contributing particles become uncorrelated and one recovers the situation described in equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">11</ref>). In addition to particle aggregation, SAS researchers have considered a wide variety of qualitatively different spatial statistics, and many analytical expressions are available for the corresponding structure factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Pedersen, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Another common situation is the case where particles repel each other, which is relevant to concentrated suspensions. In the case of <ref type="bibr">Fig. 8(c)</ref> this is modelled as a hard-sphere interaction, whereby the particles cannot approach each other closer than twice their radii [see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kinning &amp; Thomas (1984)</ref>]. The repulsion in real space converts to particles being unlikely to have similar phases. In that case, the random-walk analysis of the scattered amplitude still holds but the directions of the steps are anti-correlated. This results in a scattered wave amplitude lower than in the incoherent case, which is referred to as a correlation-hole effect. The structure factor corresponding to this situation is plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">9</ref>(b). In the limit of low q, similar to the case of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_41">8</ref> the structure factor is much smaller than one. In the limit of large q, corresponding to small Ã , minute differences in the particle positions lead to huge differences in their phases. The random-walk analysis becomes valid again in that limit, and S(q) converges to one.</p><p>The last case we consider is that of a periodic arrangement of particles, as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_41">8(d</ref>). The figure corresponds to a very specific value of q and a specific orientation, for which the periodicity of the structure coincides with direction y of the phase map. In this exceptional configuration, all particles in the structure scatter coherently. This is manifest in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_41">8(d)</ref>, where all the vectors are parallel and lead to very strong scattering. This corresponds to a diffraction condition, which is obtained when the periodicity of the phase map Ã coincides with the spacing d between planes in a crystalline arrangement. Using then equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) to express this in terms of the scattering angle, one recovers Bragg's law in the familiar form of equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>). The integer n results from the observation that n Ã is also a periodicity of the phase map for any n. Scattering by a crystalline structure is not limited to the diffraction peaks. However, the intensity of the peaks scales like the squared number of particles, as for any coherent effect. On the other hand, the scattering between the peaks is incoherent. It therefore scales linearly with the number of particles and is hence much weaker than the peaks. Actual crystals have finite sizes and contain structural defects, both of which contribute to widening the scattering peaks beyond Bragg's condition. In the limit of large q, all the thus- broadened peaks overlap and S(q) converges to one also in this case.</p><p>Note, finally, that the present discussion of diffraction in a more general context than Bragg's law enables one to understand not just the position of the peaks but also their intensities. The particle positions in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_41">8(d</ref>) were chosen to be identical to the 2D hexagonal arrangement of the pores in the experimental SAXS pattern in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">4(a)</ref>. Compared with the structure factor in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">9</ref>(c), the measured second and third diffraction peaks seem to be almost extinct. This has nothing to do with a lack of structural periodicity, but merely results from the multiplication of the structure factor by the form factor of the pores, in line with equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_14">14</ref>). In the case of porous silica in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>(a), the form factor of the pores has a minimum at a value of q that is coincidentally very close to the peak position in the structure factor. When all is properly accounted for, the relative intensities of the peaks in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>(a) can be used to infer the pore size of the material <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gommes et al., 2016)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX A</head><p>The phase map h (x, y, z)</p><p>We address here a geometric question. Considering Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2</ref>, for a given position of the source and detector (strictly, of a given pixel in an actual detector), what is the length of a wave's trajectory from the source to the detector, which passes through a given point (x, y, z)? To indicate that the answer depends on the detector position, we call this L (x, y, z). Because the phase of a wave increases by a quantity 2 each time it travels a distance equal to the wavelength , the phase is obtained as 2L (x, y, z)/. This can also be expressed as measuring the distance between the source and detector via a scatterer, in units of /( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>).</p><p>To answer the question, we choose space coordinates with axes (x, y) as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">10</ref>(a), i.e. making an angle /2 with the incoming beam, and z orthogonal to both x and y. The source and detector are both assumed to be infinitely far away so that all incoming waves travel parallel to each other, as do all outgoing waves. This defines a wedge with opening angle , the left-hand side of which is at a distance L S from the source, while the right-hand side is at a distance L D to the detector. The grey dot in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">10</ref> is the position of a point (x, y, z) for which we endeavour to calculate L (x, y, z). With the selfexplanatory notations of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_43">10(b)</ref>, the total distance travelled by a wave from the source to the detector, via the electron, is</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">L = L S + L 1 + L 2 + L D .</formula><p>We use the notation L 0 for the total opening of the wedge at distance y from the origin, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_43">10(b)</ref>. Using trigonometry, one finds L 0 /2 = y tan(/2). From Fig. <ref type="bibr">10(b)</ref>, it is also apparent that L 1 = (L 0 /2 + x) cos(/2) and L 2 = (L 0 /2 À x) cos(/2).

As the intensity is</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">I ¼ A 2 r þ A 2 i , the corresponding distribution is f ðIÞ dI ¼ 1 Na 2 exp ÀI Na 2 dI;<label>ð19Þ</label></formula><p>with dA r dA i = dI. From this distribution the average intensity is hIi = Na 2 , as in equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">11</ref>), and the percentiles can easily be calculated as reported in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_41">8</ref>. Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_20">19</ref>) implicitly assumes that A r and A i are statistically independent, which is justified in the limit of large N <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Merzbacher et al., 1977)</ref>. When expressed in terms of the amplitude |A| = I 1/2 , the distribution in equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_20">19</ref>) is known as Rayleigh's probability density function, and it was first proposed in the context of acoustics <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Rayleigh, 1880;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Merzbacher et al., 1977)</ref>. Much later, Lord Rayleigh suggested it as a solution to a statistical problem posed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pearson (1905)</ref> to model the travelling of mosquitoes, thereby bringing it into the field of random walks. As recalled by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Nahin (2009)</ref>, Pearson commented, 'I ought to have known it, but my reading of late years has drifted into other channels, and one does not expect to find the first stage in a biometric problem in a memoir on sound.' It is a nice twist that this equation appears again in a wave propagation setting, not about acoustics but about X-ray and neutron scattering. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Neutron scattering has found wide use for the characterization of polymers owing to the partial deuteration method. Use of deuterated macromolecules in a non-deuterated environment is comparable to the staining method used in electron microscopy in order to enhance contrast. Polymer science and neutron scattering have been recognized at the highest level, through the award of the Nobel Prize in Physics to P.G. de Gennes in 1991 and to C. Schull and B. Brockhouse in 1994.</p><p>Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) is a well-established characterization method for microstructure investigations in various materials. It can probe inhomogeneities from the near atomic scale (1nm) to the near micron scale (600nm). Since the construction of the first SANS instrument over 25 years ago, this technique has experienced a steady growth with over 20 instruments constructed worldwide. These are either reactor-based instruments using monochromated neutron beams or time-of-flight instruments at pulsed neutron sources. SANS has had major impact on the understanding of polymer conformations, morphology, rheology, thermodynamics, etc. This technique has actually become a "routine" analytic characterization method even for the non-experts.</p><p>These notes are intended to help first time users of neutron scattering acquire (or brush up on) basic knowledge on the technique, and on its applications to polymer systems. Because the focus will be on small-angle neutron scattering, quasielastic/inelastic scattering and the dynamics of polymers will not be discussed. Neutron production, SANS instrumentation and structure factor calculations have been included along with elementary modeling methods for homogeneous polymer mixtures as well as phase separated systems (domain scattering). Readers of these notes need not be experts in nuclear physics, statistical mechanics or advanced mathematics; basic knowledge in such areas is, of course, useful. Also knowledge of the Fourier transform method is essential for understanding reciprocal space.</p><p>After a brief review of basic neutron properties, we will introduce the major processes used to produce neutrons as well as list the major neutron sources in the United States and in the world. Production of cold neutrons (essential for SANS applications) is discussed along with description of cold neutron remoderators. SANS instrumentation is then examined in no great detail focussing on the major components and pointing out differences between reactor-based and spallation source-based instruments. Elements of neutron scattering in general will follow; including advantages and disadvantages of the technique, scattering lengths and cross sections, coherent/incoherent scattering contributions, and example calculations. Because "most SANS spectra look alike", SANS is a heavily model-dependent method. Models of single-particle structure factors are discussed with no attempt at completeness. Interparticle contributions are introduced for both homogeneous polymer mixtures (solutions, blends, etc) and phase separated systems (microphase separated copolymers for example) using two simple models (random phase approximation and Ornstein-Zernike equation). The first few chapters (I-VII) are general enough to benefit everyone interested in the SANS technique, the remaining chapters focus on SANS from polymers. Those interested in biopolymers and microemulsions would also benefit from these last chapters. The last few chapters (VIII-XII) concentrate on polymer systems. Data borrowed from research projects of this author are included. Because this is a tutorial and not an extensive review article, the focus is on simple issues and only representative data are discussed.</p><p>References to published material in the subject (especially review articles and books) are included along with "Questions" that are meant to help the reader think about some extra issues.</p><p>Even though the focus of the notes is on polymer materials, knowledge acquired can be useful to understand scattering from other systems. The field of polymers is at the top of the users list for SANS (40% of the users at NIST), followed by complex fluids (24% at NIST) and biology (14%).</p><p>Modeling of these systems, for instance, involves two main parts to the scattering function describing intra-"particle" and interparticle contributions. The word "particle" is often used to refer to scattering inhomogeneities such as deuterated polymer chains, domains in microphase separated copolymers, micelles in microemulsions, latex spheres in colloidal suspensions, etc. The modeling will be kept at its basic level for the sake of simplicity; structure factors for many particle shapes (spherical, rodlike, etc) and many chain architectures are available. Interparticle structure factors based on the Ornstein-Zernike equation for uniform density objects or the mean field random phase approximation for polymer mixtures are also briefly described.</p><p>Because polarized neutron beams have not found applications in polymer research, polarization capabilities on SANS instruments will not be discussed. Deuterium is known to effect changes in sample properties (documented shifts of phase transition lines by a few degrees in polymer systems for example); Because they are small, these effects will also not be discussed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. BASIC PROPERTIES OF THE NEUTRON</head><p>The neutron was discovered by Chadwick in 1932. It has zero charge, a mass of 1.0087 atomic mass unit, a spin of 1/2 and a magnetic moment of -1.9132 nuclear magnetons. It has a half life of 894 seconds and decays into a proton, an electron and an antineutrino. Its interactions with matter are confined to the short-range nuclear and magnetic interactions. Since its interaction probability is small, the neutron usually penetrates well through matter making it a unique probe for investigating bulk condensed matter. Since the neutron can be reflected by some surfaces when incident at glancing angles, it can also be used as a surface probe. Neutrons are scattered by nuclei in samples or by the magnetic moments associated with unpaired electron spins (dipoles) in magnetic samples. Because the nuclear scattering potential is short range, neutron scattering can be described by "s wave" scattering so that the scattering cross section can be described by the first Born approximation. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. NEUTRON SOURCES</head><p>Since the early days of neutron scattering, there has been an insatiable demand for higher and higher neutron fluxes. Neutron sources are based on various processes that liberate excess neutrons in neutron rich nuclei such as Be, W, U, Ta or Pb. Presently, the highest fluxes available are around a few x10 15 n/cm 2 sec. Even though various neutron sources exist, only a few are actually useful for scattering purposes. These are:</p><p>--continuous reactors --spallation sources --pulsed reactors and fission boosters.</p><p>--photoneutron sources</p><p>Emphasis will be put here on continuous reactors and spallation sources. Only minor improvements in flux increase of continuous reactors are expected because of the saturation of the technology (i.e., limit of heat removal rate and operating safety considerations). Pulsed sources are expected to go to higher fluxes (non-continuous operation allows for a better heat removal rate). Nuclear weapons are ultimate neutron sources delivering 10 29 neutrons/kiloton in 1 µsec but are unpractical to use for scattering purposes (!).  Nuclear research reactors have benefited from technological advances from power producing reactors as well as nuclear submarines (compact cores operating with highly enriched fuel and foolproof safety control systems). The most popular of the present generation of reactors, the pressurized water reactor (PWR), operates at high pressure (70 to 150 bars) in order to achieve high operating temperatures while maintaining the water in its liquid phase.</p><p>Neutrons that are produced by fission (2MeV) can either slow down to epithermal then thermal energies, be absorbed by radiative capture, or leak out of the system. The slowing down process is maintained through collisions with low Z material (mostly water is used both as moderator and coolant) while neutron leakage is minimized by surrounding the core by a reflector (also low Z material) blanket. Most of the fission neutrons appear instantaneously (within 10 -14 sec of the fission event); these are called prompt neutrons. However, less than 1% of the neutrons appear with an appreciable delay time from the subsequent decay of radioactive fission products.</p><p>Although the delayed neutrons are a very small fraction of the neutron population, these are vital to the operation of nuclear reactors and to the effective control of the nuclear chain reaction by "slowing" the transient kinetics. Without them, a nuclear reactor would respond so quickly that it could not be controlled. Most of these facilities either have or are planning to add a cold source in order to enhance the population of slow neutrons and therefore allow effective use of SANS instruments. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. 3. Spallation Sources</head><p>Beams of high kinetic energy (typically 70MeV) Hions are produced (linear accelerator) and injected into a synchrotron ring to reach much higher energies (500-800MeV) and then steered to hit a high Z (neutron rich) target (W-183 or U-238) and produce about 10-30 neutrons/proton with energies about 1MeV. These neutrons are then moderated, reflected, contained, etc., as is usually done in a nuclear reactor. Most spallation sources operate in a pulsed mode. The spallation process produces relatively few gamma rays but the spectrum is rich in high energy neutrons. Typical fast neutron fluxes are 10 15 -10 16 n/sec with a 50MeV energy deposition/neutron produced. Booster targets (enriched in U-235) give even higher neutron fluxes. --KENS (Tsukuba, Japan): 500MeV protons, U target,100 µA (12 Hz), pulse width = 0.07µsec, flux = 3 x 10 14 n/sec, operating since 1980. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. 4. Pulsed Reactors</head><p>Pulsed reactors include a moving element of fuel (or reflector material which periodically passes near the core), causing brief variation of the reactivity. A fast rising burst of neutrons occurs when the reactivity exceeds prompt critical. One such reactors exists at IBR-30 (Dubna, USSR), with 0.03 MW power, pulse width of 50µsec, repetition rate of 5 Hz. Neutron fluxes are of order 5 x 10 15 n/cm 2 sec.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. 5. Photoneutron Sources</head><p>Photoneutron sources are based on the production of evaporation neutrons by photonuclear reactions or by photofission. The photons used (gammas) are produced by electron Bremsstrahlung (photons emitted when electrons are decelerated) in high Z targets (W, U or Ta).</p><p>The high Z target (W, U or Ta) acts as both the medium that slows down the electrons (therefore producing gammas) and the neutron emitting element (through photonuclear reactions). One such neutron source existed at the Linac I at Harwell (not operating anymore) with 140MeV eon Ta target which produced 10 13 n/sec. Energy deposition is about 2000MeV/neutron produced. This source was characterized by a high gamma-ray background.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. COLD NEUTRON REMODERATORS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. 1. Cold Neutron Source</head><p>"Cold" (slow) neutrons are often needed for better spatial resolution in scattering applications (long wavelength scattering). Atoms with low Z (such as H or D) are good moderators making them ideal as cold source material. Cold neutrons are generated in a neutron remoderator also called "cold source" using either hydrogen or deuterium in the liquid form, supercooled gas form, or solid form (methane or ice). The Maxwellian neutron spectral distribution (peaking at 1.8 A for thermal neutrons) is shifted to lower energies by neutron slowing down (through inelastic scattering) processes. The mean free path (average distance between collisions) of neutrons in hydrogen (0.43 cm) is smaller than in deuterium (2.52 cm). Liquid cold sources (hydrogen or deuterium) operate at low temperature (around 20 K) and 2 bar pressure. Vacuum and helium jackets isolate the remoderating liquid from the surrounding. Supercritical gas cold sources (hydrogen or deuterium) operate at 40 K and 15 bars of pressure (one phase system); thicker walls are necessary for the containment of the higher gas pressure. Solid methane at 50 K and solid ice at 35 K have been used as cold source material. Radiation damage in solid state cold sources produces stored (so called "Wigner") energy due to ionization. In order to avoid sudden release of this energy (explosion!), a recombination of radiolysis products is induced in the cold source material by warming it up on a regular basis (once every a couple of days).</p><p>Use of a cold source yields high gains (one to two orders of magnitude) at high wavelengths.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. 2. Cold Neutron Spectrum</head><p>Neutrons are produced by fission with energies around 2MeV, then they slow down to form a Maxwellian spectrum distribution which is peaked around the moderator temperature k B T (in energy units).</p><p>The neutron flux φ(E) is the number of neutrons crossing a unit area (1cm 2 ) per second in all directions and with energies E.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>T) exp(-E/k</head><formula xml:id="formula_21">E ] T) /(k [ (E) B 2 B o φ = φ . Its integral is the total flux: ∫ ∞ φ = φ 0 (E) dE o .</formula><p>φ(E) can also be expressed in terms of the neutron wavelength λ = h/(2mE)</p><p>1/2 as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">φ(λ) = φ o [h 4 /2(k B Tm) 2 ](1/λ 5 ) exp[(-h 2 /2mk B T)(1/λ 2 )]</formula><p>where h is Planck's constant. For high λ, the flux decreases as 1/λ 5 . A cold source effectively shifts the Maxwellian peak to higher wavelengths therefore increasing the population of cold neutrons and yielding better small-angle neutron scattering resolution. For elastic scattering, this means the ability to resolve larger macromolecular structures (close to micron size). of the (often cold) neutron spectrum while time of flight SANS instruments use the whole spectral distribution with careful timing between the source chopper and the detector to separate out the various wavelength frames. In this last case (TOF instruments) the maximum length of an instrument is determined by the pulse frequency so as to avoid frame overlap problems (the slowest neutrons of a pulse should not interfere with the fastest neutrons of the next pulse).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. 1. Continuous SANS Instrument Components</head><p>A brief description of the main components of reactor-based SANS instruments follows:</p><p>--Cold neutrons are transported through total internal reflection at glancing angles inside neutron guides. These transmit neutrons from the cold source to the entrance of scattering instruments with little loss.</p><p>--Beam filters (for example, Be for neutrons and Bi for gammas) are used to clean up the beam from unwanted epithermal neutrons (Be transmits neutrons with wavelengths &gt; 4 A) and gamma radiation (stopped by high-Z materials as Bi). Note that if a curved guide is used, no filter is needed because there is no direct line-of-sight from the reactor core (no gammas in the beam) and curved guides transmit only wavelengths above a cutoff wavelength (no epithermal neutrons in the beam). Typical filter thickness is between 15 cm and 20 cm. For better effectiveness, filters are cooled down to liquid nitrogen temperature.</p><p>--A velocity selector yields a monochromatic beam (with wavelengths λ between 4 A and 20 A and wavelength spreads from ∆λ/λ=10% to 30%). Some SANS instruments that need sharp wavelength resolution use crystal monochromators (with wide mosaic spreads to give ∆λ/λ&lt;10%) instead. Because ∆λ/λ is constant, the neutron spectrum transmitted by the velocity selector falls off as 1/λ 4 (instead of the 1/λ 5 coming from the moderator Maxwellian distribution).</p><p>--An evacuated pre-sample flight path contains a beam collimation system. Typical adjustable flight path distances are from 1 m to 20 m depending on resolution and intensity design considerations. The collimation usually consists of a set of pinholes (source and sample apertures) that converge on the detector. Inside the pre-sample flight path, more neutron guides (with reflecting inner surfaces) are sometime included in parallel with the collimation system for easy insertion into the beam. This allows a useful way to adjust the desired flux on sample along with the desired instrumental resolution by varying the effective source-to-sample distance.</p><p>--A sample chamber usually contains a translation frame that can hold many samples (measured in sequence). Heating and cooling of samples (-150 o C to 200 o C) as well as other sample environments (cryostats, electromagnets, ovens, shearing devices, etc) are often accomodated.</p><p>--The post sample flight path is usually an evacuated cylindrical tube (to avoid scattering from nitrogen in air) that permits the translation of an area detector along rails in order to change to sample-to-detector distance.</p><p>--The area detector is often a gas detector with 0.5 cm to 1cm resolution and typically 128x128 cells. The detection electronics chain starts with preamplifiers on the back of the detector and comprises amplifiers, coincidence and timing units, plus encoding modules and a means of histogramming the data and mapping them onto computer memory. In order to avoid extensive use of vacuum feedthroughs, the high count rate ILL-type area detector design incorporates most electronics modules (amplification, coincidence, encoding, etc) inside an electronics chamber that is located on the back of the detector. In this design, flexible hoses are, however, needed to ventilate the electronics and to carry the HV cable in and the encoded signal out.</p><p>--A set of beam stops is used to prevent the main beam from reaching the detector and therefore damaging it due to overexposure. Use of Li-6 glass as neutron absorber avoids the gamma-ray background obtained with Cd, B or Gd containing materials. For easy alignment, motion of the beam stops should be independent of that of the area detector.</p><p>--A low-efficiency fission chamber detector located right after the velocity selector is used to monitor the neutron beam during data acquisition and a He-3 thin pencil detector is mounted on one of the beam stops (that can be moved in or out of the beam) for transmission measurements.</p><p>--Gamma radiation produced by neutron capture in various neutron absorbing materials (Cd, Gd, B) is stopped using high-Z shield materials (Fe, Pb, concrete). Shields surround the velocity selector and beam defining apertures. The scattering vessel is also shielded in order to minimize background reaching the detector.</p><p>--Data acquisition is computer controlled within menu-driven screen management environments and on-line imaging of the data is usually available.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. 2 . Time of Flight SANS Instrument Components</head><p>A time of flight SANS instrument comprises some of the main features described above (collimation, sample chamber, flight paths, area detector, etc) as well as some other features described here:</p><p>--A source chopper to define the starting neutron pulse.</p><p>--The area detector is synchronized to the source chopper so that a number of wavelength frames (for example 128) are recorded for each pulse. No monochromator is necessary with the time of flight method.</p><p>--A supermirror bender can be used (as on the LOQ instrument at ISIS for example) to remove short wavelengths and let the instrument get out of the direct line of sight from the source. Note that curved guides have a cutoff wavelength below which neutrons are not transmitted. This bender replaces the filter.</p><p>--High wavelengths (say above 14A) have to be eliminated in order to avoid frame overlap. This can be done by gating the detector or through the use of frame overlap mirrors (as on the LOQ instrument at ISIS). Reflecting mirrors are set at a slight angle (1 o ) from the beam direction so as to reflect only long wavelength neutrons (note that the reflection critical angle varies linearly with wavelength).</p><p>Because of the wide wavelength range used in time of flight instruments, materials that display a Bragg cutoff (such as sapphire windows) cannot be used. Data reduction becomes more complex with time of flight instruments because most corrections (transmission, monitor normalization, detector efficiency, linearity, uniformity, etc) become wavelength dependent. Time of flight instruments have the advantage, on the other hand, of measuring a wide Q range at once. Also the large number of wavelength frames can be kept separate therefore yielding very high wavelength resolution (∆λ/λ&lt;1%) which is useful for highly ordered samples (some fibers are crystalline in one direction with essentially "perfect" mosaic spread).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. 2. Sample Environments</head><p>Typical sample thickness for SANS measurements is of order of 1 mm. Liquid samples (polymer solutions, microemulsions) are often contained in quartz cells into which syringes can be inserted. Solid polymer samples are usually melt pressed above their softening (glass-rubber) temperature, then confined in special cells between quartz windows. Flexibility of design for some instruments allows the use of typical size samples under temperature control or bulky sample environments. Temperature is easily varied between ambient temperature and 200 o C using heating cartridges or between -10 o C and room temperature using a circulating bath. Other sample environment equipment such as low-temperature cryostats (4 to 350 K) and electromagnets  are sometime made available to users. Various shear cells (Couette, plate-and-plate, etc) are helping probe "soft" materials at the molecular level in order to better understand their rheology. A few pressure cells are also finding wide use for investigations of compressibility effects on the thermodynamics of phase separation as well as on structure and morphology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. 3. SANS Measurements</head><p>SANS measurements using cold neutrons take from a few minutes to an hour when measuring typical polymer samples. The process starts by sample preparation, which consists in weighing the right amounts of polymers and solvents and mixing them to form homogeneous mixtures. If polymer blends are the desired outcome, solvent is evaporated, sample is dried then hot pressed to yield the right size and thickness sample.</p><p>A reasonable instrument configuration is chosen at first by setting a low wavelength and varying the sample-to-detector distance so as to optimize the desired Q-range. If the maximum available sample-to-detector distance is reached, wavelength is then increased. Choice of the source-tosample distance, wavelength spread, and aperture sizes are dictated by the desired instrumental resolution (sharp scattering features require good resolution) and flux on sample. Scattered intensity is proportional to many factors that have to be optimized: I(Q)=φATd[dΣ/dΩ]∆Ωεt (φ: flux, A: sample area, T: transmission, d: sample thickness, ε: detector efficiency, t: counting time). Transmission measurements are usually performed at the beginning of an experiment. In order to avoid complicated multiple scattering corrections, sample transmissions are kept high (&gt;60%).</p><p>A complete set of data involves measurements from the sample, from an incoherent (usually nondeuterated) scatterer that yields flat signal, from the empty cell and a blocked beam and from a calibrated (absolute standard) sample. SANS data are corrected, rescaled to give a macroscopic cross section (units of cm -1 ) then averaged (circularly for isotropic scattering or sector-wise for anisotropic scattering). Reduced data are finally plotted using standard linear plots <ref type="bibr">(Guinier, Zimm, Kratky, etc)</ref> in order to extract qualitative trends for sample characteristics (radius of gyration, correlation length, persistence length, etc) or fitted to models for more detailed data analysis. The small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering methods (SANS, SAXS) are useful for polymer research because they probe size scales from the near atomic to the near micron. Static light scattering (SLS) complements these techniques by focussing on the micron length scale. Other methods such as wide-angle neutron and X-ray scattering (WANS, WAXS) and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) probe very local (atomic) structures.</p><p>Neutron scattering is the technique of choice for condensed matter investigations in general because thermal/cold neutrons do not deposit energy in the scattering specimen. For instance, neutrons of 1 A wavelength have much lower kinetic energy (82meV) than x-rays and electrons of the same wavelength (12keV and 150eV respectively).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. 2. Characteristics of Neutron Scattering</head><p>A few advantages of neutron scattering follow:</p><p>--Neutron scattering lengths vary "randomly" with atomic number and are independent of momentum transfer Q. This is used to advantage in deuterium labeling using the fact that the scattering lengths of hydrogen and deuterium are widely different (-0.3741 and 0.6674 x10 -12 cm respectively). The negative sign in front of b H means that the phase of the wavefunction is inverted during scattering.</p><p>--Neutrons have high penetration (low absorption) for most elements making neutron scattering a bulk probe. Sample environments can be designed with high Z materials (aluminum, quartz, sapphire, etc).</p><p>--Neutrons have the right momentum transfer and right energy transfer for investigation of both structures and dynamics in condensed matter. The neutron-spin-echo method has found wide use in polymer dynamics studies; this method falls outside of our scope.</p><p>--A wide range of wavelengths can be achieved by the use of cold sources. One can reach very low Q's and overlap with static light scattering (SLS) using a double crystal monochromator (so called Bonse Hart) instrument.</p><p>--Since neutron detection is through nuclear reactions (rather than direct ionization for example) the detection signal-to-noise ratio is high (MeV energies released as kinetic energy of reaction products).</p><p>A few disadvantages of neutron scattering follow:</p><p>--Neutron sources are very expensive to build and to maintain. It costs millions of dollars annually to operate a nuclear research reactor and it costs that much in electrical bills alone to run a pulsed neutron source. High cost (billions of US$) was a major factor in the cancellation of the Advanced Neutron Source project.</p><p>--Neutron sources are characterized by relatively low fluxes compared to X-ray sources (synchrotrons) and have limited use in investigations of rapid time dependent processes.</p><p>--Relatively large amounts of samples are needed: 1 mm-thickness and 1 cm diameter samples are needed for SANS measurements. This is a difficulty when using expensive deuterated samples or precious (hard to make) biology specimens. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. NEUTRON SCATTERING LENGTHS AND CROSS SECTIONS</head><p>Scattered intensity is proportional to the so called "contrast factor" which contains the scattering lengths. This and other terminology is introduced here along with elements of scattering theory. where f(θ) is the scattering amplitude. The scattering vector Q=k i -k s characterizes the probed length scale and its magnitude is given for elastic scattering in terms of the neutron wavelength λ and scattering angle θ as Q=4πsin(θ/2)/λ. For small angles (SANS), it is simply approximated by Q=2πθ/λ. Because Q is the Fourier variable (in reciprocal space) conjugate to scatterer positions (in direct space), investigating low-Q probes large length scales in direct space. An orbital angular momentum characterizes each neutron incident on the scattering nucleus. For thermal/cold neutrons, only "s wave" scattering (corresponding to a zero orbital angular quantum number) is important, "p wave" scattering becomes important only above neutron energies of 200 keV, which has no contribution in scattering applications. In this case (s-wave scattering) a phase shift δ 0 , and a scattering length a can be defined <ref type="bibr">(Sears, 1992)</ref>:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII.1. Scattering Lengths</head><formula xml:id="formula_23">f(θ) = (1/2iQ) [exp(iδ 0 ) -1] ≅ -a + iQ a 2 + . . . (Eq. VII.2)</formula><p>where Q is the neutron wavenumber. The scattering length itself can be complex if absorption is non negligible: a = a R -ia I , although neutron absorption is small for typical polymer samples.</p><p>Moreover, since no nucleus is completely free, bound scattering lengths should be used instead: b = a (A + 1)/A, where A is the atomic number. Free and bound scattering lengths are substantially different only for low mass elements such as hydrogen.</p><p>The differential scattering cross section dσ/dΩ depends on two quantities: (1) a techniquedependent factor which for neutron scattering is called the contrast factor and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) a sampledependent term which is called the static structure factor and represents the structure of the scattering environment in the sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. 2. Scattering Cross Sections</head><p>The microscopic differential scattering cross section is given by: dσ(θ)/dΩ = |f(θ)| 2 . It is also defined more practically as: number of scattered neutrons inside a solid angle dΩ with scattering angle θ per nucleus per sec dσ(θ)/dΩ = __________________________________________ number of incident neutrons per cm 2 per sec This cross section contains information about what inhomogeneities are scattering and how they are distributed in the sample (chain conformations, morphology, etc). The microscopic scattering cross section is its integral over solid angles: σ s =∫[dσ s /dΩ] dΩ and is given by: σ s = 4π|b| 2 (units of barn=10 -24 cm 2 ). Bound scattering lengths b and cross sections σ s are tabulated <ref type="bibr">(Sears, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr">Koester et al, 1991)</ref>.</p><p>Given the number density N (number of scattering nuclei/cm 3 ) in a material, a macroscopic cross section is also defined as: Σ = Nσ (units of cm -1 ). SANS data are often presented on an "absolute" macroscopic cross section scale independent on instrumental conditions and on sample volume; this is: dΣ/dΩ = Ndσ/dΩ.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. 3. Estimation of Neutron Scattering Lengths</head><p>A simple argument is used here in order to appreciate the origin of the scattering length.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IX. 1. Definitions</head><p>Consider a sample consisting of N scatterers (think monomers) of coherent scattering length {b} each occupying a sample volume V. The scatterer density (and its Fourier transform) are defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">n(r) = ∑ N i δ(r-r i ) and n(Q) = ∑ N i exp[iQ.r i ].</formula><p>(Eq. IX.1)</p><p>Note that these quantities vary randomly with position r and momentum Q. The average density being constant (&lt;n(r)&gt;=n=N/V), a fluctuating density (and its Fourier transform) are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">∆n(r) = ∑ N i δ(r-r i ) -n and ∆n(Q) = ∑ N i exp[iQ.r i ] -(2π) 3 nδ(Q) (Eq. IX.2)</formula><p>where δ(Q) is the Dirac delta function which does not contribute except at Q=0 (along the very forward direction) which is experimentally irrelevant. The static structure factor for the system is defined as the density-density correlation function: where summations or integrations are taken over all scatterers. The coherent scattering cross section is (as mentioned before): dσ c (Q)/dΩ = {b} 2 S(Q). (Eq. IX.4)</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">S(Q) = &lt;n(-Q)n(Q)&gt; = ∑ N ij</formula><p>Note that because coherent scattering is the only relevant part in our discussions, the subscript "c" will be dropped and the curly brackets around the coherent scattering length {b} will be omitted. Given these definitions, the various summations or integrations are usually split into two parts: one over scatterers that belong to the same macromolecule (intramolecular) and one that involves scatterer pairs belonging to different macromolecules (intermolecular). In the case of phase separated systems, the intra-and intermolecular pieces are replaced by intra-and interdomain contributions. The intramolecular part is often also referred to as single-"particle" as described in what follows for Gaussian coils and a few particle shapes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IX. 2. Structure Factor for a Gaussian Coil</head><p>Consider a flexible polymer coil where each monomer pair located a distance r ij apart obeys the Gaussian distribution: The monomer pair is always correlated through chain connectivity so that the simplifying approximation P(Q)={F(Q)} 2 (that will be made for uniform density objects) is not valid. The configuration average is taken over the probability distribution: &lt;...&gt; = ∫ dr ij P(r ij ) ... and the static structure factor is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">P(Q) = (1/N 2 ) ∑ N ij &lt;exp[-iQ.r ij ]&gt; = (1/N 2 ) ∑ N ij exp[-Q 2 &lt;r ij 2 &gt;/6] (Eq. IX.6)</formula><p>where a property of the Gaussian distribution has been used:</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">&lt;exp[iQ x x ij ]&gt; = exp[-Q x 2 &lt;x ij 2 &gt;/2] = exp[-Q x 2 &lt;r ij 2 &gt;/6]. (Eq. IX.7)</formula><p>For a random walk chain, a further simplifying assumption is made: &lt;r ij 2 &gt; = a 2 |i-j| where a is the so called statistical segment length and represents monomer size. To simplify the double summation, the following identity is used:</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">(1/N 2 ) ∑ N ij F(|i-j|) = (1/N)F(0) + (2/N 2 ) ∑ N k (N-k)F(k).</formula><p>(Eq. IX.8) Furthermore, assuming that the degree of polymerization N (number of monomers per chain) is large compared to unity, P(Q) can be put into the form:</p><p>A simple case involving correlations between 2 blocks (n monomers each) separated by 3 linear chain portions (n 1 , n 2 and n 3 monomers respectively) that are joined at the extremities of the 2 blocks (see Figure <ref type="bibr">IX.3)</ref> is considered here. This structure can be constructed using a long linear chain (with 2n+n 1 +n 2 +n 3 monomers) that comprises 2 crosslinks (corresponding to r 2 =0 and r 3 =0 in Figure <ref type="bibr">IX.3)</ref>. All segment lengths are assumed to be equal to a. A trivariate Gaussian distribution describing this structure is given by: The average mean square distance between 2 monomers i and j that belong to the blocks of length n is therefore given by: The partial structure factor describing correlations between the two outside blocks is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">P(</formula><formula xml:id="formula_44">P(Q) = (1/n 2 ) ∑ n ij exp[-Q 2 &lt;r ij 2 &gt;/6]</formula><p>(Eq.

IX.18)</p><p>In summary, this method consists in forming the correlation diagram using one single chain and choosing judiciously the location of crosslinks. All elements of the correlation matrix C need to be calculated so that the first element (recall that r 1 =r ij ) of its inverse, D 11 =∆ 11 /∆ (where ∆ 11 is the cofactor of element C 11 and ∆ is the determinant of C) is obtained therefore yielding &lt;r ij 2 &gt;/a 2 =∆/∆ 11 . This procedure is useful for the calculation of correlations in many "lattice animals" needed in the modeling of complicated architectures (rings, "olympic rings", regular networks, etc).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XI. TYPICAL SANS DATA FROM POLYMER SYSTEMS</head><p>There are two main areas of SANS research on polymers: homogeneous mixtures and phase separated systems. Whereas sophisticated theories (mean field RPA for example) exist for the interpretation of data from homogeneous polymers, most data analysis from multiphase systems is based on following trends from size and scaling information. Nonlinear least-squares fitting of the scattering data to models as well as standard plots are the main tools. Standard plots consist in assessing linear behaviors (when plotting functions of the intensity as functions of Q) in order to extract characteristic slopes and intercepts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XI.1. Standard Plots</head><p>The Guinier plot involves Ln(I) vs Q 2 in order to obtain R g 2 /3 (R g is the radius of gyration of the inhomogeneity) as slope (Ln(I)=Ln(I 0 )-Q 2 Rg 2 /3+...). The radius of gyration represents the effective size of the scattering "particle" whether it is a domain or a polymer chain. Interparticle effects always contribute to R g except at the infinite dilution limit (case of an isolated particle). The usefulness of this plot stems from the fact that the obtained particle size (R g ) is independent of the absolute intensity (I 0 ). Instrumental smearing as well as polydispersity and multiple scattering appear to decrease the effective R g . Another well known plot is the Zimm plot (1/I vs Q 2 ) which found wide use in light scattering from dilute polymer solutions where extrapolation to zero Q and zero concentration yields the molecular weight and the second virial coefficient. The Zimm plot is also useful in polymer blends (in the single-phase region) where the slope is proportional to the correlation length, which is proportional to the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter (incompressible RPA model). Assuming a Lorentzian form for the Q-dependence of the intensity: I=I 0 /(1+Q 2 ξ 2 ) where ξ is the correlation length, a plot of 1/I vs Q 2 yields 1/I 0 as intercept (call it A) and ξ 2 /I 0 as slope (call it B). The correlation length is obtained as (B/A) 1/2 . In the low-Q region, one can also expand I=I 0 (1-Q 2 R g 2 /3+...) = I 0 /(1+Q 2 R g 2 /3+...), so that ξ=R g /(3) 1/2 . The Zimm plot is, however, useful beyond the low-Q region. In high-Q region, Q 2 ξ 2 &lt;1 so that 1/I=Q 2 ξ 2 /I 0 . In this region, the single chain structure factor behaves as 2/Q 2 R g 2 (high-Q expansion of the Debye function) so that ξ=R g /(2) 1/2 is identified. In the case of polymer solutions with excluded volume interactions, the high-Q expansion is, instead, 2/(QR g ) 1/ν where ν is the excluded volume exponent (ν=3/5 for fully swollen chains, ν=1/2 for theta chains and ν=1/3 for collapsed chains). Low-Q departure from linear behavior of the Zimm plot is a signature of non-homogeneity in the sample or of chainbranching.</p><p>57   </p></div>

The Fourier transform is also a monotonically decreasing function of Q which is characteristic of correlation decay beyond a "correlation length". In the example of Figure XI.7, scattering intensity is seen to increase as composition fluctuations build up close to the spinodal transition temperature.

Scattering models involving single-particle and interparticle contributions are useful for the interpretation of scattering data (domain sizes and interdistances). Other morphologies (double diamond, gyroid, etc) have also been discussed in the literature. Because of this microphase separation, scattering from block copolymers is characterized by a peak (a ring for isotropic scattering). The peak position (Q max ) gives an estimate of the average distance between domains (d=2π/Q max ). Scattering from diblock copolymers is characterized by a peak even in the homogeneous onephase region; the so-called correlation hole peak. Because the polystyrene-polyisoprene diblocks considered here are characterized by an upper order-disorder transition (ODT) temperature, the one-phase region is reached upon heating (note that for copolymers, the spinodal line is referred to as ODT). As the sample is heated through the ODT, the scattering peak becomes broader and moves slightly to higher Q values. Precise monitoring of the peak position and height give an estimate of the ODT temperature. Another example of diblock copolymer scattering corresponds to the scattering from a diblock in the spherical morphology. The first and second peaks can be clearly observed along with the hint of another higher order feature. For spherical morphology, if the first order peak occurs at Q max , the second, third, etc., order peaks occur at (2) 1/2 Q max , (3) 1/2 Qmax, (4) 1/2 Qmax, etc. Note that for highly ordered cylindrical morphologies, these ratios are 1, (3) 1/2 , (4) 1/2 , etc., whereas for lamellar morphology, they are simply 1, 2, 3, etc.  </p></div>

Because at high-Q, the structure factor for Gaussian chains goes as 2/Q 2 R g 2 , this plot tends to a horizontal asymptote. Interchain contributions affect only the constant multiplying this term and not the 1/Q 2 scaling behavior. Deviation from a horizontal asymptotic behavior indicates a non-Gaussian characteristic for the scattering objects. For instance for rigid rods, this plot would go to a linearly increasing asymptote Q 2 I = A+BQ because the structure factor for a rod goes like 1/Q at high Q and one has to use a more natural Kratky plot for a rod (QI vs Q) in order to recover the horizontal asymptote.</figDesc><graphic coords="70,90.12,100.92,408.00,315.35" type="bitmap" /></figure>

SMALL ANGLE NEUTRON SCATTERING INSTRUMENT</head><p>The first SANS instruments utilizing long flight paths, long wavelength neutrons from a reactor cold source and position sensitive detectors were developed in Europe (Julich, Grenoble, Pisa). Small angle neutron scattering instruments should really be called low-Q instruments (Q being the momentum transfer which for low scattering angles θ is given in terms of the neutron wavelength λ as Q=2πθ/λ). Low Q can be realized either through the use of small angles or high wavelengths. In order to obtain small angles, good collimation and good area detector resolution are needed. Good collimation is achieved through the use of long neutron flight paths before and after the sample. SANS instruments on continuous neutron sources use velocity selectors to select a slice</p><p>The result is the well-known Debye function <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Debye, 1947)</ref>:  Polymer chains follow Gaussian random walk statistics in polymer blends and in polymer solutions at the so-called theta temperature condition (where interactions between monomers and solvent are equivalent). Other structure factors are available for swollen chains (self-avoiding walk) or collapsed chains (self-attracting walk) in polymer solutions (for an overview, see for example <ref type="bibr">Hammouda, 1993)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IX. 3. Other Polymer Chain Architectures</head><p>Many polymer chain architectures exist: "stars" consist of many equal size branches connected to a central core, "combs" consist of side branches grafted onto a main chain, "rings" consist of looped chains, "gels" consist of highly branched structures that are grown outwardly (dendrimers are the most regular gels), "networks" consist of crosslinked systems that contain a large number of interconnected structures, etc. These various polymer systems are made in the homopolymer form (all monomers are chemically identical) or copolymer form (each chain portion consists of blocks of monomers that are chemically different). Single-chain structure factors for such architectures have been worked out and are summarized elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[Burchard, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hammouda, 1993]</ref>. In the remainder of this section, a systematic method based on multivariate Gaussian distributions used to calculate partial correlations for arbitrary architectures is described.</p><p>Because the scattering elements are not correlated, the average of the product &lt;n(r)n(r')&gt; is equal to the product of the averages &lt;n(r)&gt;&lt;n(r')&gt; and therefore:</p><p>where the form factor is: F(Q) = ∫dr exp[iQ.r] &lt;n(r)&gt;/N. For uniform density, the average over configurations &lt;n(r)&gt; becomes trivial: &lt;n(r)&gt; = N/V = n if r≤R (Eq. IX.21) &lt;n(r)&gt; = 0 if r&gt;R so that:</p><p>where the spherical Bessel function j 1 (x):</p><p>has been used. The structure factor for the sphere is therefore: The Guinier (Q-&gt;0) expansion gives: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IX. 5. Structure Factors for Other Spheroid Shapes</head><p>Following the same procedure, the form factor and structure factor for a spherical shell between radii R 1 and R 2 (and hollow for r&lt;R 1 ) can be calculated as follows:</p><p>(Eq. IX.29)</p><p>The radius of gyration (squared) for the spherical shell is</p><p>3 ) (Eq. IX.30)</p><p>For an ellipsoid of half axes a, b, c oriented so that its axes make angles α, β, γ with the Q direction, an effective radius R e is defined as: R e 2 =a 2 cos 2 (α)+b 2 cos 2 (β)+c 2 cos 2 (γ). (Eq. IX.31)</p><p>The form factor is the same as the one for a sphere of radius R e :</p><p>and the structure factor (for a randomly oriented sample) is an average over all possible orientations of the ellipsoid.:</p><p>and the final result is:</p><p>The radius of gyration of a disk is: R g =R/(2) 1/2 .</p><p>To obtain the structure factor for an infinitely thin rod of length L, we take the R-&gt;0 limit instead, and obtain:</p><p>where Si(x) is the sine integral defined as:</p><p>The radius of gyration for an infinitely thin rod is: R g =L/(12) 1/2 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IX. 7. Pair Correlation Functions</head><p>The structure factor S(Q) is the Fourier transform of the probability distribution function P(r):</p><p>(Eq. IX.43)</p><p>Given an infinitesimal scattering volume chosen randomly in the considered "particle", P(r) represents the probability of finding another scatterer within the particle a distance r apart. Usually, a one-dimensional probability distribution p(r) (also referred to as "distance distribution function") is defined instead:</p><p>(Eq. IX.44) p(r) is available for some of the shapes discussed before. For a sphere of radius R:</p><p>For a disk of radius R:</p><p>For an infinitely thin rod of length L, the integration is performed from 0 to L instead, the normalization constant is 1/L and:</p><p>(Eq. IX.47)</p><p>Note that the probability distribution function P(r) is better known when defined for "interparticle" contributions (correlations in a "liquid" of point particles) and is often referred to as pair correlation function g(r)=VP(r) (where V is the sample volume):</p><p>where a constant term that has no contribution except in the forward direction (∫dr exp[iQ.r] = (2π) 3 δ(Q)) has been added.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IX. 8. Structure Factor for a Parallelepipedon</head><p>Even though this is not a realistic shape to describe material microstructures in the nanometer scale, it is included here for completeness. Consider a rectangular parallelepipedon of sides a, b, c. In cartesian coordinates, the form factor can be split into the product of three pieces that depend on the three coordinates respectively:</p><p>and the structure factor is, here also, an average over orientations:</p><p>where γ is the orientation angle between Q and one of the symmetry axes of the parallelepipedon.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>X. INTERCHAIN AND INTERPARTICLE STRUCTURE FACTORS</head><p>Except at the infinite dilution limit, interchain and interparticle contributions have to be included in any description of the scattering from polymer systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>X. 1. Case of a Polymer Melt</head><p>Consider a homopolymer melt consisting of M chains of degree of polymerization N each. The structure factor S(Q) can be split into an intrachain part and an interchain part:</p><p>where r αiβj is the interdistance between a pair of monomers i and j belonging to two polymer  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>X. 3. Case of a Dilute Polymer Solution</head><p>Another well known mean field approximation used to express the interchain part R(Q) in terms of the single chain part P(Q) is called Zimm's single-contact approximation <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Zimm, 1946)</ref> which assumes that two polymer chains in dilute solution can interact only through one effective contact. Consider two monomers (call them i and j) on two neighboring chains (say chains 1 and 2) and write their interdistance vector as: r 1i2j = r 1i1k + r 1k2m + r 2m2j where k-m is the single-contact between the two chains. With this approximation, the interchain structure factor can be simplified:</p><p>This decoupling of the three terms is possible only because the probability densities can be written as products: P(r 1i ,r 1k ,r 2m ) = P(r 1i ,r 1k )P(r 1k ,r 2m )P(r 2m ,r 2j ). (Eq. X.9)</p><p>The &lt;exp[iQ.r 1k2m ]&gt; term is the excluded volume between the two polymer chains and is defined as v (normalized to the sample volume V):</p><p>v/V = -∫ dr 1k2m [g(r 1k2m )-1] exp[iQ.r 1k2m ] = -&lt;exp[iQ.r 1k2m ]&gt; (Eq. X.10) so that R(Q) becomes:</p><p>This formula:</p><p>is valid for very dilute solutions whereby interchain contributions are weak (equivalent to keeping only the second virial coefficient in a virial expansion).</p><p>Higher order contributions (see <ref type="bibr">Higgins-Benoit, 1994 for example)</ref> describing interactions between two chains through a third chain are taken into account by adding (v/V) 2 [MN 2 P(Q)] 3 , or in general through n intermediate chains by adding (v/V) n-1 [MN 2 P(Q)] n :</p><p>. X.13) This series can actually be re-summed (1-x+x 2 -x 3 +...=1/1+x) to give:</p><p>which is the basis for the Zimm plot. This mean field result applies for non-dilute solutions as well.</p><p>In fact, it works better for semidilute and concentrated solutions because the types of interactions that are not included (loop interactions within a chain and multiple contact interactions) become smaller when the polymer concentration increases. When such interactions are important (in dilute solutions), renormalization group theories do a better job at describing polymer solutions.</p><p>Defining a more practical variable for the polymer volume fraction φ=MNv 0 /V where v 0 is the monomer molar volume, MN is the total number of monomers in the solution and V is the sample volume and redefining the structure factor as S(Q)=S(Q)v 0 2 /V (the reason for this normalization will become apparent in the next section), we obtain:</p><p>Using the small-Q expansion (1/P(Q)-&gt;1+Q 2 R g 2 /3), one can see that a plot of φ/S(Q) vs Q 2 yields R g 2 /3 as slope and (1/N)+(v/v 0 )φ (degree of polymerization and excluded volume) as intercept. The excluded volume v is related to the second virial coefficient A 2 as:</p><p>where m w is the monomer molar mass and N av is Avogadro's number.</p><p>The macroscopic cross section is given by:</p><p>where the contrast factor contains the monomer and solvent scattering lengths b p and b s respectively and molar volumes v p and v s . Note that the macroscopic cross section dΣ(Q)/dΩ is</p><p>(Eq. X.28)</p><p>Our dilemma is that we have one integral equation (Ornstein-Zernike) with two unknowns (h(r) and c(r)); this can be solved only if another (so called "closure") relation is introduced. Many of these closure relations have been discussed (hypernetted chains, Born-Green, Percus-Yevick, mean spherical approximation, etc). Using these closure relations, numerical solutions of the Ornstein-Zernike equation yield realistic interparticle structure factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Schweizer-Curro, 1989)</ref> .</p><p>The last two closure relations (Percus-Yevick and mean spherical approximations) are discussed here because they allow simple analytical solutions to the integral equation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>X. 7. The Percus-Yevick Approximation</head><p>This approximation gives another relation in order to "close" the integral equation:</p><p>which, for a hard sphere interaction potential between particles: w(r) = 0 for r&gt;σ (Eq. X.30) w(r) = ∞ for r&lt;σ gives the solution: c(r) = 0 for r&gt;σ (Eq. X.31) c(r) = -λ 1 -6φλ 2 r/σ-(φ/2) λ 1 r 3 /σ 3 for r&lt;σ where:</p><p>(Eq. X.32) φ is the packing fraction (=πmσ 3 /6), m is the density of scattering particles and σ is the "effective" particle diameter.</p><p>The Fourier transform of the direct correlation function can be calculated as:</p><p>12(Qσ) 2 cos(Qσ)+24(Qσ)sin(Qσ)+24cos(Qσ)-24]/(Qσ) 6 } (Eq. X.33) and the structure factor for a liquid of structureless particles is given by:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>X. 8. The Mean Spherical Approximation</head><p>This simple approximation assumes that: c(r) = -w(r)/k B T. Because (as will be shown here) this approximation is the mean field approximation for polymer systems described previously, intraparticle contributions are included in the Ornstein-Zernike equation (from the outset) which becomes (in Fourier space):</p><p>where M/V is the total number of "particles" (think polymer chains) per unit volume. After recognizing that S(Q) =S 0 (Q) + [M(M-1)/V]H(Q), one obtains:</p><p>which is the random phase approximation result obtained for polymer solutions (where the intermonomer potential W/k B T is replaced by the excluded volume v/V) and for polymer blends (where W/k B T is replaced by 1/S BB 0 (Q) -2 χ AB /v 0 ).</p><p>Note that because the mean field approximation does not model the local interactions (for interparticle interdistances smaller than particle sizes) properly, packing effects (on thermodynamics and phase separation for example) are neglected. For this reason, the g(r) obtained from such mean field theories does not show realistic oscillations for the neighboring coordination shells. The appeal of this approach is the fact that it gives simple analytical results. The manner in which the asymptote of a Kratky plot is reached yields information about chain branching. For instance, in a plot of Q 2 I vs Q -2 (Q 2 I=A+B/Q 2 ) the intercept B is related to the crosslink density in branched gels and networks (see <ref type="bibr">Benoit et al, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>The Porod plot (Ln(I) vs Ln(Q)) yields information about the so-called "fractal dimension" of the scattering objects. At high-Q, a slope of -2 is a signature of Gaussian chains in a dilute environment, whereas a slope of -1 points to rigid rods. A slope of -4 represents a smooth interface between domains in a multiphase system <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Porod, 1951)</ref>. Slopes between -3 and -4 characterize rough interfaces of fractal dimension D <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Schmidt, 1988)</ref>. Scattering from such a rough interface drops as 1/Q 6-D . In the case of smooth interfaces, the scattered intensity at high Q goes like:</p><p>where S/V is the surface-to-volume ratio, φ is the inhomogeneities' volume fraction and (CF) is the contrast factor (CF)=(b A /v A -b B /v B ) 2 . This is a general result independent of the actual shape of the scattering particles (spheres, rods, etc). The origin of this result goes back to the form of the pair correlation function which can be written (for low interdistances r) as (see eqs. IX. 45-47 for example): p(r) = p 0 (r)  where p 0 (r) is the value at r=0. The structure factor is the Fourier transform:</p><p>which, at high-Q, goes to the limit mentioned above.  "perfect single-crystal" characterized by hexagonal symmetry. This is referred to as the "bright night sky" pattern. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XII. FINAL COMMENTS</head><p>The SANS technique has gained maturity in polymer research. In the words of one of the founders of polymer science "neutron scattering is among the four greatest developments (lasers, NMR, computers and neutron scattering) that made polymer science what it is today" (Prof. W.H. <ref type="bibr">Stockmayer, Polymer Physics Gordon Conference, 1994)</ref>. This technique has managed to grow steadily over the past twenty-five years from a "follow the trends" technique to a sophisticated characterization method in polymer morphology, thermodynamics, and rheology. Advances in the use of judicious sample environments (shear cells, magnets, pressure cells, temperature quench apparatuses, etc) have instilled new momentum. However, because neutron scattering is based at a few facilities only in the world, SANS is not as easily accessible as other method (NMR, light scattering, etc). Moreover, because SANS measurements are made in reciprocal space, other complementary techniques (such as microscopy) are often essential in order to obtain a "complete picture". Future prospects look as bright as in the past.</p></div>
