<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Dynamic light scattering (DLS), also known as photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS), is a very powerful tool for studying the diffusion behaviour of macromolecules in solution. The diffusion coefficient, and hence the hydrodynamic radii calculated from it, depends on the size and shape of macromolecules. In this review, we provide evidence of the usefulness of DLS to study the homogeneity of proteins, nucleic acids, and complexes of protein-protein or protein-nucleic acid preparations, as well as to study protein-small molecule interactions. Further, we provide examples of DLS's application both as a complementary method to analytical ultracentrifugation studies and as a screening tool to validate solution scattering models using determined hydrodynamic radii.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Detection of light scattering from matter is a useful technique with applications in numerous scientific disciplines where, depending on the light source and detector, specific properties of molecules can be studied. In a typical light-scattering experiment, sample is exposed to a monochromatic wave of light and an appropriate detector detects the signal. One of the earliest light-scattering experiments was described by John Tyndall, which characterized light scattering from colloidal suspensions <ref type="bibr">(Tyndall effect)</ref>, where particles are larger than the wavelength of the incident light <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Tyndall 1868)</ref>. Soon after, Lord Rayleigh described light scattering from particles that are smaller than the wavelength of light (Rayleigh scattering), which explained both that the sky's blue colour is a result of scattering of light due to atmospheric particles and that the refractive index of the scattering medium plays a crucial role in light scattering <ref type="bibr">(Strutt 1871a, b)</ref>. In contrast to Rayleigh theory, Gustav <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Mie (1908)</ref> described a theory <ref type="bibr">(Mie theory)</ref> to study the scattering of light from absorbing and non-absorbing particles that are large compared to the wavelength of light by taking into account particle shape and the difference in refractive index between particles and the medium the particles are present in. Peter Debye suggested that scattering for particles can be studied independently of assumptions on mass, size, or shape as a function of angle <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Debye 1915)</ref>, which is often referred as Rayleigh-Debye scattering.</p><p>The usefulness of light scattering as a method to characterize the diffusion behaviour of particles in solution resulted from a series of seminal discoveries. <ref type="bibr">Einstein and</ref> Smoluchowski proposed that liquid should be considered as a continuous medium where thermal fluctuations create inhomogeneities, which result in density and concentration fluctuations (Fluctuation theory of light scattering, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Einstein (1910)</ref>; v. <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Smoluchowski 1908)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Einstein (1905)</ref> also established Brownian motion theory (named after Robert Brown) explaining molecular motion of particles. He established that particles were subjected to random forces due to constant collision with solvent molecules resulting in random walk of particles, and that the mean squared displacement of particles due to Brownian motion is proportional to time. Later, Einstein also established a relationship between the diffusion coefficient of particles to their translational friction by including the discovery from Sir George <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Stokes (1845)</ref> that suggested that the friction exerted by a moving particle is proportional to its radius and to the viscosity of the solvent surrounding particles <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Einstein 1906)</ref>. At the same time, William Sutherland also presented a very similar derivation of the Stokes-Einstein equation independently <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Sutherland 1905)</ref>. However, until this point the role of optical anisotropy on angular dependence, intensity, and polarization of scattered light had not been studied. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cabannes and Rocard (1929)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Gans (1921;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">1923)</ref> addressed the theory of optically anisotropic scatters as well as their influence on polarisation of scattered light. By this time the Rayleigh-Gans-Debye (RGD) theory was established that included scattering from large particles; however, <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Zimm's (1945;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">1948)</ref> modifications to RGD equations led the foundation of modern lightscattering approaches that are being utilized to determine size, shape, and molecular weight of macromolecules in solution. On the other hand, Leon <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Brillouin (1914;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">1922)</ref> proposed formation of two peaks in the frequency distribution of scattered light caused by the scattering of light by phonons (quasi-particles of sound), resulting in two peaks in the Rayleigh (central) line in the frequency spectrum which was later named as the Brillouin doublet. This phenomenon was further evaluated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gross (1930)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Landau and Placzek (1934)</ref>, which in conjunction with the development of laser optics in the 1960s would revolutionize the light-scattering studies of molecules in liquids. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Pecora (1964)</ref> established that the diffusion of macromolecules in solution led to broadening of the frequency profile of scattered light. Pike and co-workers developed the first digital autocorrelator in 1969 and performed experiments on haemocyanin to determine its diffusion coefficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Foord et al. 1970)</ref>. Thus, the relationship between light scattering and diffusion behaviour of particles was established and experimentally verified, which eventually allowed characterization of molecules in solution using light-scattering methods. These events are briefly summarised in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>Over the years, Pecora, Cummins, Pike and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bloomfield and Lim 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Cummins et al. 1964;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Fujime 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Jakeman and Pike 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Pecora 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Pike 1972</ref>) had developed various approaches to determine the diffusion coefficient of molecules in solution, and ultimately their contributions led to the development of the modern dynamic lightscattering (DLS) instrument, with Malvern Instruments (Malvern, UK) commercializing the first modern DLS instruments followed by Brookhaven (Long Island, USA) and ALV (Langen, Germany). Since its inception, DLS has proven particularly popular in determining hydrodynamic behavior of proteins, nucleic acids, and viruses due to its ability to provide information on both size and aggregation. There are already a number of excellent reviews detailing the theory and applications of DLS <ref type="bibr">(Bloomfield 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Fujime 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Harding and Jumel 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Harvey 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Jamieson et al. 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Lorber et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Nieuwenhuysen and Clauwaert 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Nobbmann et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Rimai et al. 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Schurr 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Serdyuk et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Van Holde 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Zakharov and Scheffold 2009)</ref>. Here, our aim is to provide a brief theoretical background, an update on applications of DLS in studying proteins, nucleic acids, and their complexes, and a discussion of the benefits that modern instruments offer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical considerations</head><p>When a monochromatic beam of light encounters solution containing macromolecules, light scatters in all directions as a function of the size and shape of the macromolecules. In static light scattering, the intensity of scattered light is analysed as timeaveraged intensity, which provides useful information on molecular weight and radius of gyration of macromolecules. On the other hand, if the intensity fluctuations (caused due to Brownian motion of macromolecules in solution) of scattered light is analysed, the diffusion coefficient (D τ ) that is related to hydrodynamic size of macromolecules can be obtained. Dynamic light scattering, also known as photon correlation spectroscopy or quasi-elastic light scattering, is a technique that primarily measures the Brownian motion of macromolecules in solution that arises due to bombardment from solvent molecules, and relates this motion to the size (or D τ ) of particles. Such motion of macromolecules depends on their size, temperature, and solvent viscosity <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Harding and Jumel 1998)</ref>. Therefore, knowledge of accurate temperature is essential for DLS measurements, since the viscosity of solvent depends on the temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Harding 1999)</ref>. When the movement of particles over a time range is monitored, information on the size of macromolecules can be obtained, as large particles diffuse slowly, resulting in similar positions at different time points, compared to small particles (such as solvent molecules) which move faster and therefore do not adopt a specific position.</p><p>In a dynamic light-scattering instrument, when laser light encounters macromolecules the incident light scatters in all directions and scattering intensity is recorded by a detector. The monochromatic incident light will undergo a phenomenon called Doppler broadening as the macromolecules are in continuous motion in solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Harding and Jumel 1998)</ref>. The scattered light will either result in mutually destructive phases and cancel each other out, or in mutually constructive phases to produce a detectable signal. The digital autocorrelator then correlates intensity fluctuations of scattered light with respect to time (ns-μs) to determine how rapidly the intensity fluctuates, which is related to the diffusion behaviour of macromolecules. In a dynamic light-scattering experiment, we measure the G 2 (τ), an intensity correlation function (or second-order correlation function) that describes the motion of macromolecules under investigation and can be expressed as an integral over the product of intensities at time t and delayed time (t + τ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Berne and Pecora 1976)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">G 2 τ ð Þ ¼ I t ð ÞI t þ τ ð Þ h i ð<label>1Þ</label></formula><p>where, τ is the lag time between the two time-points.</p><p>The G 2 (τ) can be normalised as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">g 2 τ ð Þ ¼ I t ð ÞI t þ τ ð Þ h i I t ð Þ h i 2<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>The braces in both equations represent averaging of properties over the duration of the experiment (time t).</p><p>In a typical light-scattering experiment, it is not possible to precisely know how each particle moves in solution; however, the motion of particles relative to each other is correlated by means of an electric field correlation function, G 1 (τ), also known as the first-order correlation function, which illustrates correlated particle movement and can be defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">G 1 τ ð Þ ¼ E t ð ÞE t þ τ ð Þ h i<label>ð3Þ</label></formula><p>where, E(t) and E(t+τ) represent the scattered electric fields at times (t) and (t + τ) Similarly to equation 2, an equation 3 can be normalized as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">g 1 τ ð Þ ¼ E t ð ÞE t þ τ ð Þ h i E t ð ÞE t ð Þ h i<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><p>The g 1 (τ) and g 2 (τ) can be coupled to each other by the <ref type="bibr">Siegert relation (1949)</ref> based on an approximation that the scattering is homodyne (photodetector detects only Mie scattering: scattering of light from particles larger than the wavelength of light <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Mie (1908)</ref> Brownian motion theory: collision with solvent molecules results in random motion of particles <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Einstein (1905)</ref> Stokes-Einstein relationship: combines light scattering and diffusion behaviour of particles <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Einstein (1906)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Sutherland (1905)</ref> Fluctuation theory of light scattering: thermal fluctuations result into local inhomogeneities and intensity of scattered light can be determined by the mean-square fluctuations in density and/or concentration <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Einstein (1910</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">), v.

Compared to the detection at 90 °, at a high scattering angle, the contributions of rotational diffusion effects in the observed autocorrelation profiles can be neglected and the D τ can be obtained <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Harding 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Pusey 1972</ref>). As light does not travel through the entire sample in the cuvette, the backscattering detection system also allows for measurement of the D τ of highly concentrated samples since multiple scattering phenomenon (scattering of a photon by more than one particles in contrast to scattering of a photon by only one particle) of scattered light can be avoided. Furthermore, large dust particles and contaminants scatter more light in the forward direction as their scattering becomes wavelength-independent compared to smaller size particles (Rayleigh scattering) that have nearly equal scattering in both directions, scattering contribution of large particles could be avoided in a backscatter detecting system.</p><p>As the translational diffusion coefficient, D τ , is concentration-dependent, it should be measured at multiple concentrations and extrapolated to infinite dilution (D 0 τ ) as a standard practice. Furthermore, the D 0 τ can be converted to the standard solvent conditions (viscosity and temperature of water at 20 °C) to obtain D 0 τ,20,w <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Harding and Jumel 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Raltson 1993)</ref>. The D τ is extremely useful in the determination of other important hydrodynamic parameters. For example, the hydrodynamic radius (R h ), which can be defined as the radius of a hypothetical sphere that diffuses at the same rate as particle under investigation, can be obtained using the Stokes-Einstein equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Pusey 1972)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">D τ ¼ k B T 6πηR h<label>ð12Þ</label></formula><p>Where k B is Boltzmann coefficient (1.380 × 10 -23 kg.m 2 .s -2 .K -1 ), T is an absolute temperature, and η is the viscosity of medium.</p><p>Additionally, the translational frictional coefficient, f (F/v, ratio of frictional force F experienced by moving particles due to Brownian motion and the velocity v of the particle) that provides information on the shape of macromolecules can also be calculated using D τ by the following equation.</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">f ¼ RT N A D t<label>ð13Þ</label></formula><p>Where R is a gas constant (8.314 × 10 -7 erg/mol.K), T is an absolute temperature, and N A is Avogadro's number (6.022137 × 10 23 mol).</p><p>The frictional coefficient can also be calculated using R h and equation (12) <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Tanford 1961)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">f ¼ 6πηR h<label>ð14Þ</label></formula><p>The translational frictional coefficient can be further used along with the D τ to calculate frictional ratio (f/f 0 , ratio of Stokes radius to that of a sphere with the volume of an unsolvated macromolecule) of macromolecules that can provide information with regard to the solution conformation of macromolecules. For a compact sphere, the frictional ratio is unity and as the shape of macromolecules deviate from compact sphere, f/f 0 increases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p>Modern instruments are supplied with packages that perform data analysis, using various approaches to primarily evaluate size and homogeneity of macromolecules. In this section, we provide the background in brief on data analysis strategies. The correlation function (equation 11) contains information on diffusion behaviour of macromolecules under investigation, which in turn has information on R h (equation 12). In order to gain reliable information on diffusion coefficient, primarily two approaches are used to fit the correlation functionmonomodal distribution and nonmonomodal distribution methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Monomodal distributioncumulant analysis</head><p>The cumulant analysis method, also known as the method that does not require a priori information, provides mean values of the diffusion coefficient but not the distribution of diffusion coefficients. Therefore, this method is only suitable for Gaussian-like distributions around the mean values. As explained in equation 6, the electric field correlation factor, g 1 (τ) decays exponentially and is dependent on a decay constant, Γ(Γ = -D τ q 2 ). For a monodisperse system, the g 1 (τ) can be treated as a single exponential decay function to calculate the decay constant and hence the diffusion coefficient. However, often the experimental system is polydisperse, which requires the g 1 (τ) to be treated as the sum of several exponential decay functions that decays at different rates.</p><p>The cumulant analysis method was introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Koppel (1972)</ref> which became widely popular due to its ease and reliability, and was considered as the method of choice by the International Standards Organisation (ISO) in 1996 and again in 2008 <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(ISO 2008)</ref>.

First of all, the experimentally measured and normalized g 2 (τ) could be plotted against (τ) to fit the parameters on the right-hand side of the equation. The Γ (k 1 ), k 2 , k 3 and k 4 represents average, variance, skewness and kurtosis of measured distributions respectively for the decay rates of the Gaussian distribution. More importantly, the polydispersity index (PDI) could be derived by using k 2 / Γ 2 relationship. Ideally, parameters above k 3 are not used to prevent over fitting of the data. It should be noted that often data truncation is required (typically when the autocorrelation function decays ∼ 10 % of the maximum value) because as the signal decays into the baseline, the higher noise could drive signal to negative values which are not useful as the data processing requires mathematical treatment of data such as square root and logarithm. Also, random errors lead to huge variations fitting of cumulants. For example, with the highly sophisticated instruments, random errors in Γ could be as low as 1 % but for k 2 it could be as high as 20 %. Therefore, the high-order cumulants are not recommended to be used <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Koppel 1972)</ref>.</p></div>

Equation 24 describes the dependence of the diffusion coefficient on M w 2 , which explains that the technique is inherently biased for molecules with higher molecular weights. It should also be noted that the scattering of light depends on the refractive index of macromolecules, and that the term P(q,R) can be approximated to 1 for molecules sufficiently smaller than the wavelength of the incident light, resulting in z-averaged D τ . Since it is the intensity fluctuations of macromolecules that are being collected and analysed in a DLS experiment, the first-hand information on R h is based on the intensity-weighted distribution or simply, intensity distribution that provides z-average R h . As light scattering depends on the refractive index of macromolecules and solvent viscosity, the z-averaged R h requires input of these two properties. According to the Rayleigh approximation, the intensity distribution is approximately proportional to (size) 6 for small particles <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Barnett 1942)</ref>, as presented in equation 25. It should be noted that the z-averaged R h from DLS should only be compared with R h from other methods if the molecules under investigation are monodisperse and display monomodal distribution, particles are spherical in shape, and are solubilized in suitable buffer system, as the intensity distribution depends on the refractive index of molecules and viscosity of the medium.</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">% I a ¼ a 6 N a ⋅ 100 N a a 6 þ N b b 6<label>ð25Þ</label></formula><p>Equation 25 describes intensity distribution for a solution containing N a and N b molecules with size a and b respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysing biomolecular preparations to detect aggregation</head><p>We refer to preparations containing proteins, glycoproteins, nucleic acids (RNA, DNA), protein-protein complexes (PPC) or protein-nucleic acids complexes (PNC) as biomolecular preparations. It is important to note that samples subjected to DLS analysis are Bpolished samples^and not Bcrude preparations^meaning that the proteins, nucleic acids, or their complexes have been already purified by means of various forms of chromatography [e.g., affinity chromatography, ionexchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, and/or size exclusion chromatography (SEC)] to achieve a high level of purity. One of the most important criteria in biomedical sciences is ensuring that the biomolecular preparation is devoid of high molecular weight aggregates (HMWA), as aggregation can be a major rate-limiting factor in biochemical, biophysical, and biopharmaceutical studies. For example, an aggregated and/or inhomogeneous sample will be difficult to crystallisean essential step to obtain a highresolution structure by X-ray crystallography. Several biophysical techniques such as small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and small angel neutron scattering (SANS) can only provide reliable information for monodisperse and homogenous preparations, as molecules with higher molecular weight (albeit at extremely low concentration) will scatter heavily thereby affecting the outcomes of these experiments. As a practical commercial example, therapeutic antibodies need to go through a rigorous analysis that involves investigation of their aggregation state (amongst other properties including temperature, storage stability, and degradation) before the selection of a lead antibody candidate for therapeutic applications.</p><p>The following is a standard protocol the authors use in their laboratory for analysis of proteins, antibodies, glycoproteins, nucleic acids, and their complexes for structure biology applications.</p><p>&amp; Clean cuvette as described in subsection BMonomodal distributioncumulant analysis^. &amp; Filter the sample through 0.1 μm filter (e.g., Ultrafree-MC VV Centrifugal Filter, Merck Millipore) to remove large particulates from the preparation. &amp; It is critical to study aggregation state at the working concentrations (concentrations at which the downstream study is planned, e.g., crystallization or antibody dose).</p><p>Prior to all measurements, concentration for polished sample should be accurately measured. &amp; Often, biological samples are precious since they require time and resources. To minimise the sample requirement, we use a cuvette that requires only ∼12 μl of filtered concentrated sample. However, to avoid air bubbles we load ∼20 μl of sample carefully by reaching the bottom of the cuvette with a straight pipette tip. &amp; The software package that accompanies modern DLS instruments (such as the Zetasizer Nano S software) enables creation of a standard operating protocol (SOP) for an individual sample. We recommend that for each particular sample, a SOP should be prepared that contains essential information such as the buffer composition and experimental temperature (that in turn will calculate the viscosity at particular temperature and refractive index of buffer: essential parameters for reliable DLS measurements).</p><p>&amp; Perform the R h distribution measurements at least five times to obtain reproducible results at high concentration.</p><p>In order to study the concentration dependence of R h , we dilute the preparation by directly adding filtered buffer into the cuvette containing a high concentration of sample followed by gentle mixing using pipette and collect data. We continue this practice for multiple concentrations.</p><p>Often, we use well-characterised proteins such as BSA or ovalbumin as positive controls to ensure that the instrument is performing as expected. In addition, several NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) standards such as 60 nm or 100 nm polystyrene latex spheres should also be used to ensure proper instrument function.</p><p>The Zetasizer software provides a number of analysis methods to study aggregation by DLS. Size Distribution by Intensity and Size Distribution by Volume are the most widely used methods, whose theories are discussed in the BData analysis^section, and usefulness in practice is discussed in the next sections. The choice of the analysis method will depend on the objective of study. For example, if an analysis is aimed to study the presence of trace amount of aggregates for lead therapeutic antibody preparation (to achieve aggregationfree preparation), the intensity distribution method is more suitable, as high molecular weight aggregates will disproportionately scatter light relative to smaller particles enabling detection despite their relatively low concentration in the sample. On the other hand, if the study is aimed to investigate homogeneity to set-up crystallization trials or for additional biochemical/biophysical characterisation using analytical ultracentrifuge, SAXS, etc., purity around 95 % is acceptable and the volume distribution method can be used.</p></div>

It is a very difficult system to study, as it undergoes proteolytic degradation as well as aggregation. In order to investigate its lowresolution structure, we required a homogenous preparation devoid of both degradation and aggregation. Initial expression and purification trials produced heterogeneous preparations as presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> and<ref type="figure">b</ref>; however, subsequent optimization achieved high quality preparations without significant degradation and with less than 5 % of HMWA as detected by intensity distributions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>). It is important to note that in Rayleigh scattering, the scattering intensity depends on the 6th power of the size of molecules <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Barnett 1942)</ref>, and therefore despite being present in negligible amounts, the HMWA R h peak intensity is disproportionately represented relative to the dominant smaller molecular weight monodisperse species in the same preparation. Therefore, the HMWA peak is absent in the volume distribution (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>). This example clearly highlights DLS as a sensitive tool to screen for even trace amounts of HMWA in biomolecule preparations.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> presents an intensity distribution profile for ovalbumin (44 kDa) at multiple concentrations, where HMWA (&gt;100 nm) are visible for each concentration. However, the volume distribution profiles derived from the intensity information for each concentration display a single peak, since the amount of aggregates is negligible (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>). As a volume distribution profile represents the relative volume of high and low molecular weight species in a preparation (discussed in section 3.3), we will mainly focus on the volume distribution profiles in subsequent sections. Ideally, to report R h value, it should be first measured multiple times at each individual concentration followed by calculating mean R h value at each concentration and plotting against concentration to eliminate concentration effects, similar to the approach taken with diffusion and sedimentation coefficient measurements. We have provided an example here with ovalbumin (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>), a practice that is routinely followed in our approach for proteins and nucleic acids as well as PPC and PNC to obtain a reliable a Hydrodynamic radius distribution by intensity for nidogen-1 (ND-1) at 0.4 mg/ml, indicating that although there is a major peak for each measurement, there are multiple peaks visible between 15 nm and 500 nm (x-axis) suggesting the presence of high molecular weight aggregated species. Degradation at 4 nm is also visible for one of the measurements in red colour. b Hydrodynamic radius distribution by volume derived from intensity profiles for ND-1 at 0.4 mg/ml concentration, suggesting that volume distribution is not sensitive enough for detecting scant amount of aggregation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protein-protein interaction studies</head><p>In addition to detection of aggregation in biomolecular preparations, DLS can also be employed to study PPC.

Figure <ref type="figure">3a</ref> presents the R h distribution data for SEC purified ND-1 and LM γ-1 proteins at single concentration. After studying how individual proteins behave at multiple concentrations in terms of their homogeneity by DLS, we also investigated their complex using DLS (Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>). The R h distribution studied at multiple concentrations suggested that both proteins are highly monodisperse in solution, with R h of 6.80 ± 0.10 nm and 6.40 ± 0.05 nm respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref>). Furthermore, the complex of ND-1 -LM γ-1 was also found to be monodisperse with R h of 9.00 ± 0.04 nm (Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref>). This example clearly demonstrates the strengths of DLS techniquevery rapid measurements and requiring low amounts of purified components to study protein-protein interactions. However, since large molecules scatter light more strongly, even a trace amount of aggregation can be detected using intensity distribution. In both cases, nearly identical positions of peak suggest a homogenous preparation. For biophysical and structure biology applications, such preparations are acceptable; however, for therapeutic antibodies, further optimization may be required. c Plot of R h vs concentration for ovalbulin, where the y-axis intercept provides concentration-independent R h of 2.88 ± 0.06 nm. d Hydrodynamic radius for frequently used molecular weight standards to calibrate size exclusion column was measured at single concentration.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Homogeneity of viral RNA molecules</head><p>RNA molecules are highly labile, since exposure to trace amounts of ribonuclease impurities present in aqueous solutions and reagents, air and dust particles, as well as direct human skin contact with RNA preparations, can result in RNA degradation. Our dynamic light-scattering instrument is regularly used to study homogeneity of in-vitro transcribed RNA. The West Nile virus genome terminal regions (5' and 3') are recognised by an enzyme called 2' 5' oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), which is a part of an innate immune system. Once viral RNA is recognised, OAS1 synthesises 2'-5'-linked oligoadenylates that ultimately stimulate RNase L in order to slow viral propagation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hovanessian and Justesen 2007)</ref>. We studied interactions of the 5' terminal region (5' TR) with OAS1 as well as 3' terminal region (3' TR) using a variety of biochemical and biophysical tools, one of which was DLS. While interpreting DLS data for RNA molecules, it should be noted that the folded RNA structures are typically extended; therefore, the R h of RNA is often observed to be higher compared to a globular protein of similar molecular weight. This effect has been observed qualitatively by SEC <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Kim et al. 2007)</ref>.

However, we attempted to investigate if the G3 domain without any amino acid present at the splice site can interact with divalent cations. It should be noted that the G3 domain was expressed as a fusion protein that contains Fc domain of human IgG (G 3 B 0 Fc), which facilitates purification by means of protein A affinity chromatography. For each measurement, 20 μl of G 3 B 0 Fc (∼1 mg/ml) protein was added to a clean cuvette and allowed to equilibrate to 20 °C for 5 minutes followed by measurement of R h . Multiple measurements for intensity distribution (a) and volume distribution (b) at 3.5 mg/ml suggest that the 5' TR RNA is highly pure and devoid of any aggregation. Similarly, 3' untranslated region (3' TR) from West Nile virus was also studied using DLS at 2.7 mg/ml, where a and b present intensity and volume distributions suggesting presence of a homogenous solution of 3' TR. The 5' and 3' untranslated regions (5' TR -47.5 kDa, 3' TR -37.5 kDa) from West Nile virus were prepared using an in-vitro transcription method followed by purification using SEC and DLS analysis in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.0), 100 mM NaCl buffer as described earlier <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Deo et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Deo et al. , 2015) )</ref> As presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> for each set of experiments, an R h of ∼ 5 nm was observed for G 3 B 0 Fc that corresponds to a monomer as deduced from AUC and DLS experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Patel et al. 2011)</ref>. After measuring the R h for G 3 B 0 F c protein, CaCl 2 was added into the cuvette to final concentration of 5 mM followed by temperature equilibrium/incubation for 5 minutes prior to measurement of R h to determine effect of CaCl 2 on protein. The procedure was repeated to increase CaCl 2 concentration up to 50 mM. Figure <ref type="figure">6a</ref> demonstrates the effect of CaCl 2 , where addition of 5 mM CaCl 2 led to formation of a supramolecular complex of G 3 B 0 Fc yielding two peaks (major peak ∼ 600 nm) that increased to ∼ 800 nm when CaCl 2 concentration was increased to 50 mM. Since EDTA binds to divalent cations, we then added EDTA to final concentration of 5 mM into the cuvette containing G 3 B 0 Fc protein with 50 mM CaCl 2 . After 5 minutes of temperature equilibrium of sample, the DLS measurements were performed, which yielded a peak at ∼ 5 nm for G 3 B 0 Fc that is nearly identical to the first measurement where CaCl 2 was absent. Similarly, experiments were performed to study effect of MnCl 2 and ZnCl 2 where the R h for G 3 B 0 Fc was measured first followed by addition to MnCl 2 or ZnCl 2 to final concentration of only 2 mM, which resulted into supramolecular complex with peak ∼ 900 nm which could be reduced to the original size of G 3 B 0 Fc upon addition of EDTA to final concentration of 5 mM, as presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">6b</ref> and<ref type="figure">c</ref>. We also performed similar experiments with MgCl 2 ; however, only marginal increase in R h for G 3 B 0 Fc was observed at 50 mM MgCl 2 concentration (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the G 3 domain of agrin can interact with metal ions resulting into reversible aggregates of various sizes depending on the metal ion. However, if such behaviour of G 3 domain of agrin in vitro has any biological relevance remains to be demonstrated. It could be argued that the presence of Fc domain may influence such behaviour of agrin G 3 protein; however, we were unable to find such effect of cations on antibodies in (2.2 mg/ml), 5' TR-OAS1 complex (4.0 mg/ml), and 3' TR-OAS1 complex (3.5 mg/ml). b The concentration dependence of OAS1, 5' TR, 3' TR, 5' TR -OAS1, and 3' TR-OAS1 complex. c Hydrodynamic radius distribution for PKR 1-169 (3.5 mg/ml), VA I ΔTS (1.2 mg/ml), and VA I ΔTS-PKR 1-169 complex (1 mg/ml), suggesting homogeneity of all three species. d Dynamic light scattering data for PKR 1-169 , VA I ΔTS, and VA I ΔTS-PKR 1-169 complex are presented at multiple concentrations.

Comparison of sequence molecular weight of proteins or nucleic acids with experimentally determined molecular weight can provide useful information such as their oligomeric status, degradation, or change in molecular weight upon interaction between binding partners. There are a number of methods that can provide molecular weight information. For example, SEC can, in theory provide molecular weight for proteins, nucleic acids, or complexes. However, the molecular weight calculated from SEC relies on the assumption that the molecular weight standard and biomolecules being studied  <ref type="figure">6</ref> Protein-small molecules interaction studies. The mouse G 3 B 0 protein fused with human Fc domain of IgG-G 3 B 0 Fc was studied using DLS at 1 mg/ml. a, b, and c presents volume distribution profiles for G 3 B 0 Fc protein and its interactions with divalent cations. a A single peak for G 3 B 0 Fc appears at ∼5 nm which resolves into two peaks at ∼ 100 nm and ∼ 600 nm upon addition of 5 mM CaCl 2 . The higher molecular weight peak further increases up to ∼ 700 nm in the presence of 50 mM CaCl 2 . However, addition of EDTA (5 mM) reduces the huge complex of G 3 B 0 Fc-50 mM CaCl2 to ∼ 5 nm that essentially overlays on G 3 B 0 Fc data. Similarly, addition of only 2 mM MnCl 2 (b) and 2 mM ZnCl 2 (c) increases the size of G 3 B 0 Fc from ∼ 5 nm to ∼900 nm, indicating presence of a very heavy aggregate. Addition of EDTA (5 mM in both cases) again reduces the heavy complex to monomeric size of G 3 B 0 Fc. The C-terminal laminin G-like G 3 domain variant of chicken agrin without insert of amino acids at the alternative splice site B (B 0 ), G 3 B 0 was expressed as a fusion protein, with human Fc domain of IgG-G 3 B 0 Fc being expressed using HEK293 cells as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Patel et al. 2011)</ref>.

SAXS data can either be collected at the synchrotron using high-energy X-rays or from in-house sources where the X-rays source is much weaker. Typically, in-house SAXS data collection (∼20 °C) requires 2-4 hours of sample exposure time to X-rays, compared to the synchrotron source that requires only a few seconds. Furthermore, while collecting SAXS data, the user normally collects data for multiple samples in a single experimental setup starting from buffer, meaning that it could take over 10 hours for some samples. Therefore, samples susceptible to either storage at ∼20 °C for extended periods or radiation damage may alter the homogenous preparation of macromolecules to degraded and/or aggregated states.

Therefore, the temperature must be kept constant and solvent viscosity must be known for a reliable DLS experiment. (ii) DLS is a low-resolution method that often cannot separate molecules that are closely related (e.g., monomer and dimer).</p><p>(iii) Although it is possible to measure the molecular weight using DLS where intensity of scattered light [K*c/R θ , where K* is an optical parameter, c is concentration and R θ is an angular dependent light-scattering parameter, also known as the Rayleigh ratio; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Wyatt (1993)</ref> for more details] is plotted against concentration, it is not a very reliable and reproducible method.

(v) As the scattering intensity depends on the 6th power of the size of macromolecules (I proportional d 6 where d is a diameter of macromolecule), large aggregateseven a very small amount will affect the measurements.
