<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Over the past three decades, methods of simulating the dynamics of suspensions have expanded enormously, to the point that there are now dozens of methods and variants thereof available, whose diversity rivals that of the problems of interest. While the proliferation of methods affords flexibility and choice, it also leads to bewilderment and uncertainty regarding the "best" method to use for a problem of interest. What counts as an "optimal" method depends on the problem of interest as well as on the desired accuracy and available computational resources. This chapter is intended to provide the reader some guidance in the choice of method, based on their limitations, and strengths and weaknesses, and to provide references that would allow the reader to dig deeper into a method of interest. The reader should be warned that improvements and expansions of existing methods, as well as entirely new methods, are constantly being developed, and so any assessment of their relative merits is open to continual update. The present review is at best a snapshot.</p><p>The major features of the rheology of suspensions of hard spherical particles suspended in Newtonian media, commonly referred to as "solvents", at low Reynolds number that one might wish to model are described in Stickel and Powell <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and throughout this book. Suspensions of particles of other shapes, flexibilities, and in the presence of inertia or viscoelastic effects, are also of interest, as are nonrheological transport and structural properties. While we will mention throughout the versatility of various methods to consider a wide range of suspension transport phenomena, to keep the content within bounds and provide a focus to this chapter, we will maintain a focus on hard sphere suspension rheology at low Reynolds number. For this problem, the rheology is controlled by two independent dimensionless groups, namely the volume fraction of spheres ϕ, and the dimensionless shear rate, or Péclet number, Eq. (1.7). A schematic dependence of the dimensionless shear viscosity or relative viscosity η r ¼ η=η m on Pe and ϕ is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.1. This figure shows the key features that one wishes to predict, quantitatively, if possible: (1) the steep, and eventually singular, increase in zero shear viscosity as volume fraction rises toward maximum random packing at around ϕ ¼ 0:6; (2) the steep shear thinning for high volume fractions ϕ &gt; 0:4 when Pe ! 0:01 or so; and (3) the shear thickening that becomes pronounced for ϕ &gt; 0:4 when Pe ! 1.</p><p>Beyond predicting this basic behavior accurately, one would like to relate variations in this behavior from one system to another to the presence of particle charge, grafted stabilizing layers, particle attractive or repulsive interactions, modulus and deformation of the particles, particle-particle direct contacts (i.e., lubrication breakdown), particle roughness, and other factors present in experimental systems. One would also like to be able to expand beyond hard spherical particles to soft particles, other particle shapes such as disks, rods, and ellipsoids, droplets and bubbles, biological cells, swimming micro-organisms, as well as nonrheological phenomena such as sedimentation and electrokinetics, and influences of inertia and fluid viscoelasticity.</p><p>To even begin an assessment of methods of colloidal simulation, we need initially to inventory in more detail the features that a simulation method may contain, or lack. A method that excels in one application might perform dismally in another, depending on which aspects of the problem are dominant. A major reason that suspension dynamics have inspired so many disparate methods is that the problem has multiple length scales, ranging from small gaps h between particles, to the larger radius R of the particles, to the still-larger length scale L of a suspension fluid. For dense suspensions, L ) R ) h, making the ratio L/h very large indeed. Thus, a large range of distance scales must be covered and methods are strained to model all such scales accurately, especially outside of the limits of spherical rigid particles, no inertia, etc. Hence, depending on which aspect of the problem is deemed most crucial, different methods are called for. Thus, future efforts should include development of multi-scale modeling schemes, in which methods for resolving small-scale interactions are applied to small numbers of particles (or even just two), and the results used to tune parameters and functions deployed in lower-resolution models. Such multi-scale coarse-graining schemes are now a prominent part of simulations of molecular systems. At the present time, multi-scale modeling is rare in suspension simulations, and most researchers settle for choosing a method appropriate to their application.</p><p>Well-established continuum methods for solving Navier-Stokes equations, such as Finite Difference (FD) and the Finite Element (FE) methods, when applied to suspensions, are challenged by the many fluid-solid surfaces present in suspension flow, and especially by their movement during flow or transport. Over the past 30 years, many specialized simulation methods have been developed to cope with this issue. These can be classed into the broad categories of "continuum solvent" methods, in which the suspending medium is treated as a continuum fluid, and "particle based" in which the solvent momentum is carried by discrete particles. Among the continuum-based methods, one can take advantage of the linearity of Stokes flow and various theorems derived therefrom to determine the forces, torques, stresslets, and velocities of particles and their surfaces without ever solving explicitly for the flow of the solvent. Such methods have limitations, including greater difficulty (or even impossibility) of including inertia, and the effects of non-Newtonian media. Another option is to solve for the flow of the solvent explicitly by discretizing its velocity on a mesh, while dealing with boundaries between particles and fluid in some efficient way. The mesh enclosing the fluid can either move with the particle (a Lagrangian meshing scheme), or allow the particles to move through fixed mesh points (an Eulerian meshing scheme). An organization of many of the major methods along the lines sketched out above is given here: Note the large number of methods above that use a continuum, meshed, solvent. For simplicity, and because the scope of this review does not permit describing each of these methods in detail, we here coin the term "Meshed Continuum Solvent" (MCS) to include all such methods. These include the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method, in which the mesh moves with the particle, and the fixed-mesh methods, including the Distributed Lagrange Multiplier/Fictitious Domain (DLM/FD) method, the Force Coupling Method (FCM), the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM), and the Smoothed Profile Method (SPM). Also, since Stokesian Dynamics (SD), Accelerated Stokesian Dynamics (ASD), and Fast Lubrication Dynamics (FLD) all involve setting up grand mobility or resistance tensors, using additivity of hydrodynamic interactions between particle pairs, we will collectively refer to these methods as "Stokesian particle" (SP) methods. Before describing these and other methods in more detail, we first summarize some of the key factors that can be either essential, or unimportant, for a particular application, and, for each factor, list simulation methods that (in our view) are particularly well suited to capture it. Details and references are given later in the discussion of each method. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Brownian or Langevin Dynamics</head><p>The simplest and fastest method of simulating colloidal dynamics and rheology is simple Brownian dynamics, originating from the work of Ermak and McCammon <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>In the absence of hydrodynamic interactions among the particles, the motion of a particle in a structureless, viscous Newtonian solvent, modeled as a continuum fluid with constant viscosity, is described by a simple stochastic differential equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">_ r i t ð Þ ¼ v r i ð Þ þ D 0 k B T F i t ð Þ þ ξ i t ð Þ,<label>(3.1)</label></formula><p>where r i t ð Þ is the position vector of bead i, F i t ð Þ is the total force on the particle (exerted by other particles and external fields), v r i ð Þ is the solvent velocity at the position of the bead, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ξ i t ð Þ a random force satisfying &lt;X i t ð ÞX i t ð Þ ! 2D 0 δ t ð ÞI</formula><p>, where D 0 is the particle's diffusivity, δ t ð Þ is the Kronecker delta function, and I is the unit tensor. Eq. (3.1) omits hydrodynamic interaction (HI). Note that the inertial term proportional to € r i t ð Þ is missing from Eq. (3.1), implying a noninertial integration. Even when inertia is unimportant, it is sometimes numerically helpful to include the inertial term, in which case the simulation method is sometimes called Langevin dynamics.</p><p>To prevent particle overlap during the simulations the force F i t ð Þ can contain a steep repulsive term, but for hard particles this necessitates using tiny time steps to allow the steeply increasing repulsion to push colliding particles apart before they overlap significantly. Strating <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> avoided this by using the elastic collision method, in which the time and position of particle collisions are updated based on constant velocities between elastic collisions. A closely related method was proposed earlier by Heyes and Melrose <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. This method allows for correct determination of particleparticle pair distribution functions at equilibrium. Under shearing flow, because of its neglect of HI, the prediction of the shear viscosity with this method fails at intermediate and high shear rates, and also fails in the low shear limit at small and moderate volume fractions, as illustrated in Figures 3.2 and 3.3. Note in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.3 that the BD simulations without HI under-predict the data at lower volume fractions but overpredict at higher particle concentrations. The same can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.2, which γa 2 =D 0 where a is the particle radius and D 0 the particle diffusion coefficient of an isolated sphere, for various volume fractions given, from elastic-collision BD simulations of Strating for more than 1,000 particles. Data of Van der Werff and de Kruif <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> for silica particles in cyclohexane are plotted for volume fractions of 0.419 (dashed line) and 0.538 (dash-dotted line). The viscosity drop at high volume fraction and high Pe results from a transition to hexagonally ordered strings in the direction of the flow. Reproduced with permission from Strating, Brownian dynamics simulation of a hard-sphere suspension. Physical Review E 1999;59(2):2175-2187 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> by the American Physical Society, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevE.59.2175 also shows that the simulations exaggerate the shear thinning and show an additional drop in viscosity at high concentrations and high shear rates. This is due to particles lining up into "strings" in the flow direction, a result that is likely sensitive to the finite box size as well as to HI. The Strating model does not show shear thickening (as depicted in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.1) at high rates, due to lack of HI.</p><p>While the Brownian Dynamics method without HI does not adequately describe transport properties of suspensions, especially at high volume fractions, the model is perfectly adequate for equilibrium properties, for which transport rates are irrelevant and only the energetic interparticle interactions matter. In these cases, the speed of the method and ability to equilibrate quickly and for large numbers of particles is attractive, although of course other methods, such as Metropolis sampling, can also deliver thermodynamic properties. Nevertheless, BD methods have been used to determine phase diagrams of colloids with attractive interactions, and to give at least a qualitative picture of nonequilibrium dynamics, such as colloidal gelation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The speed of the BD method has allowed it recently to be used to examine in detail the coarsening dynamics of some 750,000 attractive spheres, albeit without HI <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stokesian Dynamics (SD)</head><p>The key feature missing from the above simulations is hydrodynamic interaction (HI). One of the first, and still most popular, methods for dealing realistically with HI (both near-and far-field), is the "Stokesian Dynamics" method presented first by Durlofsky et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and used frequently since for problems of rheology at low Reynolds number <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, sedimentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>, colloidal aggregation <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, electrophoresis <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, swimming of microparticles <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, and many others. The method combines both near-and far-field hydrodynamics, where the far-field hydrodynamics accounts for many body effects out to high order, and so provides an accurate, though not completely rigorous, method for describing dynamics, rheology, and transport properties of dense suspensions of dense spherical particles at a vanishingly small Reynolds number. The method exploits the multipole expansion in inverse separation (i.e., in powers of 1/r) for force and torque (or linear and rotational velocity) of two spheres in the Stokes-flow limit. The various terms in this expansion had been developed over many years, culminating in the tabulations of the various matrix elements by Jeffrey and Onishi <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and by Kim and Karrila <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>), with some corrections summarized in the appendix of Mohammadi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The multipole expansion fails for particles in near contact (since it is an expansion in 1/r), but near-field lubrication terms were also developed, and Jeffrey and Onishi provided a means of combining both near-and farfield terms to produce an accurate method of describing hydrodynamic interactions between two spheres at any separation.</p><p>In the form presented by Jeffrey and Onishi, however, the method only permitted the description of two-sphere problems. The extension to many spheres is the triumph of the Stokesian dynamics methods, which accomplishes this by adding pairwise the effects on the mobility of a given particle induced by forces on each particle, and then inverting the resulting grand mobility matrix for interactions of all particles to produce a grand resistance matrix to which pairwise lubrication forces are added. The summation of the pairwise mobility matrices itself does not contain multi-body effects; that is, the effects on the hydrodynamic interactions between a pair of spheres by other surrounding spheres is not included in the pairwise summation that yields the grand mobility matrix. Yet, amazingly, once the matrix is inverted into the grand resistance matrix, these many-body effects are captured, at least for the lower third-to-fifth order multipoles in the expansion <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. The Stokesian Dynamics method is summarized briefly by Foss and Brady <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>; in a nutshell, both the diffusivity and random force term in Eq. (3.1) must be replaced by matrix-multiplied terms to account for the hydrodynamic interactions. An early assessment of multipole moment expansion methods and their accuracy and cost is provided by Ladd <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>While Stokesian Dynamics is much more accurate than simpler methods, the required matrix manipulations are expensive; the computational cost scales as the third power (N 3 ) of the number of particles <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, limiting the original method to simulation of only a few hundred particles or so. However, centrosymmetric interparticle forces are readily included, as well as torques that might be generated when noncentrosymmetric forces (such as axisymmetric forces) are present. Brownian motion can be included as well, with added expense. As SD simulations are based on analytical hydrodynamic interaction tensors valid for Stokes flow, flow domain boundaries require either the use of modified interaction tensors that account for the boundaries, or the use of boundary particles to account for momentum transfer to or from walls. The need to add wall particles increases the expense of the method. Periodic geometries can be handled by using a particle mesh Ewald scheme to sum hydrodynamic influences over periodic images. The results are satisfying: Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.8 shows the predicted curve of shear viscosity versus Péclet number, which not only gives a result in agreement with experiments (as exemplified by the schematic in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.1), but shows the origins of the shear thinning and thickening phenomena in the Brownian and hydrodynamic contributions, respectively, to the stress. Note in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.2 the failure of simple Brownian Dynamics (without HI) to capture the shear thickening is obviously a result of the absence of the hydrodynamic interactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accelerated Stokesian Dynamics (ASD)</head><p>The great expense of Stokesian dynamics and its rapid decline in efficiency with increasing numbers of particles (notice the small number of particles used to obtain the data in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.8) motivated the development of accelerated Stokesian dynamics (ASD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. ASD removes the most costly step for large numbers of particles N, which is the computation and inversion of the far-field grand mobility or resistance matrices, which include interactions between every pair of particles in the simulation. ASD avoids this expense by taking advantage of the fact that the far-field hydrodynamic force (and not the elements of the matrix itself ) suffices for the iterative calculation of the particle velocities, rather than using the expensive direct inversion. Hence, using a particle-mesh approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, an Ewald-summed wave-space contribution is calculated as a Fourier transform sum, and the iterative inversion can then be calculated at order O(N ln N) rather than O(N 3 ) as in regular SD. The usual near-field lubrication forces are added again, as in the regular SD technique. For the sedimentation velocity in a model problem of a simple cubic array of spheres, which has an exact solution due to Zick and Homsy <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, the ASD method appears to be just as accurate as SD, although both begin to deviate from the exact solution as particle density becomes high. A related acceleration technique, the Spectral Ewald Accelerated Stokesian Dynamics (SEASD) method was recently proposed by Wang and Brady <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>; it becomes more efficient than regular Stokesian dynamics when the number of particles exceeds around 300, and can be sped up another factor of 10 by using GPU processors. Various versions of it include speeded-up methods for handling Brownian motion using a mean-field approximation.</p><p>An extension of Stokesian dynamics to nonspherical particles is possible through treating nonspherical particles as aggregates of spherical particles <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, at the cost of much greater expense, especially when the nonaccelerated SD is used with its N 3 scaling of simulation time with the number of spherical subparticles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fast Lubrication Dynamics (FLD)</head><p>Ball and Melrose <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> noted that, for dense suspensions, near-field lubrication hydrodynamics becomes more important than far-field hydrodynamics at least in shear flows. Moreover, lubrication hydrodynamics is limited to pairs of neighboring particles, while far-field HI requires summing over all pair interactions between each sphere and every other sphere. Thus, a great savings in cost is achieved if the far-field interactions are neglected, while retaining the near-field lubrication hydrodynamics. This "pair-drag" approximation is able to predict qualitatively the shear-dependent viscosity of spheres in dense suspensions. Kumar and Higdon <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref> suggested an improvement, called Fast Lubrication Dynamics, in which, rather than ignoring completely the far-field hydrodynamics as the "pair-drag" model does, instead replaces them by an isotropic far-field resistance tensor, resembling an "effective viscosity" calculation by Beenakker <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. The resistances in this isotropic tensor to translation, rotation, and to velocity gradients are obtained from short-time diffusion and viscosity coefficients from full Stokesian dynamics simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. The far-field tensor in this method is thus independent of time-dependent or shear-dependent suspension structure. The short-range pair-wise lubrication resistance matrix is retained and carries a strong dependence on suspension structure. An open-source FLD code exists within the LAMMPS software suite. The zero shear viscosity for FLD matches that of full Stokesian Dynamics for particle concentrations less than 40%, and falls below SD results by about 20% when the concentration reaches 50% <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</p><p>Bolintineanu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> carefully compared FLD with both Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) and Multi-Particle Collision (MPC) dynamics simulations for dense suspensions, using LAMMPS codes for each of these methods. They concluded that, when the equations are integrated "inertially", that is with the acceleration term included for the colloids (the solvent is Stokesian of course, and responds instantly to changes in colloidal forces), the FLD method yields late-time diffusion coefficients in excellent agreement with those from the more rigorous Stokesian dynamics method, while significant deficiencies emerge for both DPD and MPC dynamics. It is also much easier to obtain simulation input parameters from physical parameters for the FLD method than for DPD or MPC.</p><p>However, given that the far-field isotropic resistance in FLD was tuned to capture equilibrium suspension properties, the largest deviations in FLD might well occur under strong flows that distort both near-and far-field suspension structure away from equilibrium. A comparison of the predictions of FLD with Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) and Multi-Particle Collision (MPC) dynamics (also known as Stochastic Rotation Dynamics, or SRD), using LAMMPS algorithms, can be found in Schunk et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p><p>Following prescient work by Melrose and Ball <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, it has been increasingly recognized in recent years that in dense suspensions lubrication layers will at moderate stress be squeezed down to thicknesses comparable to particle roughness or even molecular dimensions, leading to "lubrication breakdown", including direct contacts between particle surfaces with frictional contact forces. A "minimal" model that includes such forces is that of Seto and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>, who modified the "pairdrag" model of Melrose and Ball <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> to include static and sliding frictional forces that occur upon attainment of a critical normal force pressing the two particles together. This model, while phenomenological, is able to predict the discontinuous shear thickening that is observed in many dense colloids, but is not predicted by models containing only traditional lubrication forces in the near field; see Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.4. The area is currently of great interest and controversy, and since these contact forces arise as solvent is squeezed to the molecular level, the phenomenon illustrates well the challenge in suspension dynamics of handling length scales spanning literally from atomic to continuum. Simulation methods, or combinations of them, that can realistically encompass such a range are needed, and should inspire much imaginative and exciting work in the coming years, work that is likely to have wide application in many areas outside of suspension rheology, such as tribology, printing, and others.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Boundary Element Analysis</head><p>The Boundary Element Method (BEM) (or Boundary Integral Method) uses the linearity of the Stokes equations (at zero Reynolds number) to determine a Green's function that allows derivation of integral equations from which forces and velocities on surfaces can be obtained, without the need to determine velocities in the bulk fluid (although these can be computed afterward by post-processing boundary data) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Linearity is similarly used in Stokesian Dynamics (SD) to avoid solving explicitly for the flow. However SD also takes advantage of explicit formulas available for hydrodynamic interactions (multipole expansions for the far field and lubrication formulas for the near field) between pairs of spheres. BEM uses only the point-force limit of these formulas, but integrates this point force over particle surfaces that can be of complex and/or flexible shape. Such shapes include capsules <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>, biological cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, and swimming micro-organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. While the BEM can be more efficient than solving the flow field in the bulk fluid, especially for three dimensional flows, it is still computationally demanding, and often limited to just one or two such particles, although Zhao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> simulated around 50 red blood cells in a capillary, but with equal viscosity for fluid inside and outside of the membrane to reduce costs. BEM can be used to obtain pairwise interaction matrices for particles of complex but rigid shape, which are then used to solve many-particle problems in periodic geometries, albeit in semi-dilute conditions where two-body interactions dominate. Such an approach has been used for example for swimming micro-organisms by Ishikawa and Pedley <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Further, Brownian forces were included in a "fluctuating boundary element" method <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, Swan and Wang <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> developed a fast method to compute transport particles of complex shape. It resembles Stokesian Dynamics in that it uses resistance matrices to compute forces and velocities of spherical particles, but resembles the Boundary Element Method in that the resistance matrices are based on the low order Rotne-Prager tensor and the spherical particles are used as points to outline the shape of nonspherical particles. It gains speed and favorable scaling with system size through the use of GPU implementation of Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) summation of long-range interactions. Its intended use includes the hydrodynamics of complex particles such as proteins.</p></div>

This is then applied as a distributed body force on the flow field, gridded on a lattice. It captures the far-field solution accurately and can typically resolve body forces well but does not fully resolve the flow field close to the particle surfaces.

The key step in the method is to assign a velocity to boundary particles that ensures that the no-slip velocity is imposed on the surface of the prescribed boundary; see Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.6. This establishes better control over the boundary condition of a suspended object than is possible with some other particle-based methods. Inclusion of near-field lubrication generally requires explicit inclusion of analytical forms for lubrication forces <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref>, and this has been applied with success to the prediction of the zero shear viscosity of dense hard sphere suspensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref>.</p><p>A review of the method can be found in Harting et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref> along with a comparison to Lattice Boltzmann dynamics and some example problems involving sedimentation. While the original method does not include Brownian motion, in an extension of it called "Smoothed Dissipative Particle Dynamics" (SDPD) the SPH method is modified to allow fluctuating hydrodynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref>, in a manner consistent with the Landau-Lifshitz theory for fluctuating hydrodynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>. The method then bears similarity to Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD), but with a more careful control of the solidliquid boundary, extendible to nonspherical particles without needing to compose them of aggregated spheres. A number of problems involving one or two rotating spheres, and a sphere interacting with a wall or interacting with another sphere hydrodynamically, were solved accurately by SDPD <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref>. The method requires an interaction cut-off radius r c that is 2-4 times longer than required by DPD, with a consequent increase in cost, but with more accurate solution. Recent simulations with this method were able to solve up to 1,000 or so non-Brownian 2D disks at high concentration with the inclusion of short-range repulsive forces between particles, allowing simulation of shear thickening <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref>.</p><p>In addition to Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics, other methods of using non-Brownian particles to replace continuum solvent include the element-free Galerkin method (EFGM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref>, the reproducing kernel particle method (RKPM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99]</ref>, and the finite point method (FPM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.2">Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD)</head><p>Dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[101]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[103]</ref> was developed as a mesoscopic particle simulation method that uses soft conservative repulsive forces to regulate relative interactions among the components and dissipative and random thermal forces to control the friction. The method allows larger time steps than is possible with atomistically realistic interactions. The restriction of conservative forces to purely repulsive forms is workable for condensed liquid phases, where volume changes on mixing are small, and fluid structure is controlled by relative interactions among the species. Thus a relative attraction between two species can be created by making their interaction less repulsive than that of other interactions. The basic equations of the DPD method are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">dr i dt ¼ v i , m i dv i dt ¼ F i ,<label>(3.2)</label></formula><p>where r i , m i , and v i are the position, mass, and velocity of the ith particle; and F i is the total force experienced by the ith particle. The total force acting on the ith particle by all other particles (j) is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">F i ¼ X j6 ¼i F C ij þ F D ij þ F R ij ,<label>(3.3)</label></formula><p>where F C ij , F D ij , and F R ij represent the conservative, dissipative, and random forces, respectively. These pairwise additive forces are given as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">F C ij ¼ a ij w r ij À Á rij (3.4) F D ij ¼ Àγw D r ij À Á rij Áv ij À Á rij (3.5) F R ij ¼ σw R r ij À Á θ ij Δt ð Þ À1=2 rij (3.6)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">r ij ¼ r i À r j , rij ¼ r ij = r ij , v ij ¼ v i À v j ,</formula><p>Δt is the timestep, a ij is the repulsion parameter between beads i and j, γ is the friction coefficient, σ is noise amplitude, w D (r) and w R (r) are dimensionless weight functions for the dissipative and random processes, and θ ij ¼ θ ji is a white-noise Gaussian random variable: 2 and σ 2 ¼ 2γk B T. A common choice for weight function of the conservative force is the soft interaction given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">&lt; θ ij t ð Þ &gt;¼ 0 and &lt; θ ij t ð Þθ kl t 0 ð Þ &gt;¼ δ ik δ jl þ δ il δ jk À Á δ t À t 0 ð Þ.

Since the solvent is composed of particles that exchange momentum through both the conservative and dissipative forces, DPD allows hydrodynamics to be captured for arbitrary spatial distributions of particles and arbitrary boundaries. The soft potentials and dissipative forces make no attempt at molecular realism, but allow mass and momentum transfer to occur with time steps that are much larger than those in molecular dynamics, with a consequent speed-up in simulation. A key aspect of the dissipative force is that it conserves linear momentum, and so preserves hydrodynamic interactions. The dissipative force does not conserve mechanical energy, however, and the energy lost is replaced by the random force, for which momentum is conserved pair-by-pair. Especially given that publically available DPD codes are available, such as in the LAMMPS suite, DPD has become a versatile way of solving many problems in soft-matter thermodynamics and transport, involving polymers, surfactants, colloids, biological materials, and more <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[104]</ref>. The computational cost of DPD scales simply linearly with the number of DPD particles, O(N). Colloidal particles can be simulated in DPD by lumping hundreds of small DPD particles into each larger, rigid, colloid <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[105]</ref>.</p><p>Because the method relies on collisions of DPD particles to transfer momentum, the speed of momentum transfer within the fluid is finite, and hence the Stokes-flow limit cannot be attained, although it can be approached by decreasing the dimensionless velocity, with a consequent increase in cost. The softness of the particle interactions also makes the fluid somewhat compressible. Thus both the Mach number Ma = U/U s , where U s is the speed of sound, and the Reynolds number Re ¼ ρUL=η m are nonzero, and if their values are not made small enough, results of DPD simulations can show spurious effects. The softness of the potential also leads to rather slow momentum transfer relative to mass transfer, leading to values of the Schmidt number Sc ¼ η m =ρD, i.e. the ratio of these two rates, to be artificially low, unless countermeasures are taken <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>. The use of particles with a thermostat regulating their velocities means that DPD particles are Brownian, so that the fluid bead Péclet number (Pe f ) is finite, and fluctuations in stress must be averaged out, making the method less suitable for problems where Brownian forces are negligible. The colloid particle Péclet number Pe in DPD simulations is the DPD fluid particle Péclet number Pe f times the ratio of the diffusivity of the colloidal particle to the diffusivity of the DPD fluid particle <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref>. These sources of possible error can be assessed from the following formulas <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Ma ¼ U ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi k B T=m ð Þþ λa ii nr 4 c =m À Á q ; Re ¼ mnUL η ; Sc ¼ η mnD ; Pe f ¼ UL D ¼ ReÁSc,<label>(3.8)</label></formula><p>where m is the mass of the DPD particle, n is the number of particles per unit volume, λ is a numerical constant typically equal to π=15, r c is the range of the repulsive potential, a ii is a typical bead-bead repulsion parameter, η the fluid viscosity, D the DPD fluid particle diffusivity, and U and L are the characteristic velocity and length scale of the flow. Formulas for η and D can be obtained in Marsh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref>.</p><p>A key challenge in DPD simulations is that one cannot control directly the dimensionless groups above (Ma, Re, Sc, Pe f ), but only indirectly through choice of DPD parameters (m, k B T, n, a ii ). In particular, the final expression in Eq. (3.7) implies that non-Brownian (Pe f )1), noninertial (Re ( 1) flows require very large Schmidt numbers Sc. As mentioned, there are means of achieving high Sc through creating very strong dissipative interactions between DPD beads, but these lead to poor resolution of flows in thin boundary layers <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref>. On the other hand, if high Re is desired, the Mach number Ma rises with it, eventually destroying the accuracy of the flow through artificial compressibility of the fluid. For example, this generally puts turbulent flow with DPD out of reach. The DPD method is thus "mesoscopic" not only in using fluid particles or mesoscopic size, but also in the sense that all dimensionless groups are of intermediate value, often neither vanishingly small nor asymptotically high. This makes it essential to control DPD parameters carefully so that the dimensionless groups one wishes to be asymptotically small or large, be "small or large enough" to give acceptably accurate results. Additionally, integration of the DPD equations must be done carefully to avoid either inaccuracies on the one hand, or excessively small time steps on the other. A brief review of methods can be found in Mai-Duy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>.</p><p>An alternative version of DPD is the Fluid Particle Model (FPM) (not to be confused with Fluid Particle Dynamics (FPD), in which the solvent is a continuum) introduced by Español and Revenga <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref>, and its modification by Pan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[109]</ref>. This method uses a large DPD particle for each colloidal sphere, rather than an aggregate of DPD solvent particles, and includes a noncentrosymmetric dissipative force between colloidal particles or between solvent and colloidal particle as well as including particle torques. The conservative force is made relatively hard for the sphere-sphere interactions. The result is a rather successful prediction of zero shear viscosity versus particle concentration, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[109]</ref>. Since the solvent must carry hydrodynamic information from each colloidal particle, there must be many (around 200 solvent particles per colloid particle), and thus DPD simulations with hundreds of colloid particles require tens of thousands of DPD solvent particles to simulate a dense suspension. Nevertheless, Pan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[109]</ref> estimate that DPD simulations of colloidal suspension are around three orders of magnitude faster than accelerated Stokesian Dynamics (ASD). While regular DPD seems to give viscosities and normal stress differences roughly consistent with SD simulations, precise comparisons of these methods and clear benchmarks to establish the relative accuracy and speed of these methods do not seem to have been developed yet. Also, standard DPD suspension simulations do not seem able to yield the shear thickening regime as they do not resolve thin lubricating layers.</p><p>Whether the colloid particle is simulated as an aggregate of solvent beads or as a separate larger particle, the size of the solvent particles is an appreciable fraction of the size of the colloidal particle. This creates two problems when the colloidal particles approach each other closely. First, the few, or no, solvent particles remaining in the gap between the colloidal particles are unable to properly represent the lubricating hydrodynamic forces between the particles. Second, when there is no room between the colloids for the solvent particles, a depletion force arises that drives the colloids together to free up more room for the excluded solvent particles outside of the gap. These problems are addressed by the "core-modified" DPD method of Whittle and Travis <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref>, which, like the method of Pan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[109]</ref>, uses noncentrosymmetric, dissipative interactions, which occur over a "shell" layer surrounding a particle core that is prevented from overlapping other particle cores through a strong core-core repulsion. Another dissipative force between DPD colloids is used to represent the lubrication force, using analytical theory to provide the form of this force. Issues with including depletion can be offset by including an additional counteracting force that is based on an analytical expression for dilute suspensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref>.</p><p>Jamali et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[111]</ref> and Boromand et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref> have very recently extended the method of Whittle and Travis <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref> by including elastohydrodynamic deformation resulting from compressive forces acting on the particles as they are driven together by flow. Thus, they solved the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">m i dv i dt ¼ X F C ij þ F D ij þ F R ij þ F el ij þ F H ij þ F CoreÀ n;t ð Þ ij , (<label>3.9)</label></formula><p>where the conservative, dissipative, and random force terms (the first three on the right side) are similar to those of conventional DPD, discussed earlier. The fourth term is an electrostatic interaction (if needed). The lubrication (pair-drag) term is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">F H ij ¼ Àμ H ij v ij Áe ij À Á e ij ; μ H ij ¼ 3πη 0 a 3 =2δ, 0 &lt; h ij δ 3πη 0 a 3 =2h ij , h ij &gt; δ &amp; ,<label>(3.10)</label></formula><p>which regularizes the normal lubrication term by limiting the force to a maximum one at a lubrication layer thickness of δ. Here a is the colloidal particle radius. η m is the viscosity of the suspending medium and the gap between particles i and j is h ij . Finally, the "core" force includes both a normal (n) and a tangential (t) force, the latter of which can support both static and sliding stress, is influenced by particle roughness Δ, and is described by Jamali et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[111]</ref> and in most recently modified form by Boromand et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref>. In the simulations of Jamali et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[111]</ref>, δ was set to 10 -6 a, while Δ was set to 10 -3 a, where a is the particle radius. The resulting DPD method gives similar results to those obtained using frictional Stokesian dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.8 shows that the predictions of these "core-modified" DPD simulations are in qualitative agreement with experimental data for ϕ around 0.50. The model shows a transition from negative first normal stress difference N 1 in the lubricated shear thickening regime to positive values in the frictional regime where a percolated pathway of frictional contacts emerges, a normal-stress transition seen in recent experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[113]</ref>. Such features of shear thickening in hard sphere colloidal suspensions are discussed in Chapter 1. These various corrections to DPD, while yielding results similar to those from rigorous Stokesian dynamics, do not yet provide quantitative agreement to date to experimental data for hard sphere dispersions over the complete range of particle concentration and shear rate. In addition, Whittle and Travis <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref> find, for their coremodified method, that the short-time diffusivity increases with increasing particle volume fraction above ϕ = 0.4, rather than decreasing, as it does in experiments and in SD simulations. (They believe this result to be general to DPD simulations, although it was not reported on in the work of Jamali et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[111]</ref> or Boromand et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref>). However, it appears that with recent modifications the DPD method is approaching the accuracy of Stokesian dynamics for both dilute and dense suspensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.1">Multi-Particle Collision (MPC) Dynamics, or Stochastic Rotation Dynamics (SRD)</head><p>A method formerly known as Stochastic Rotation Dynamics (SRD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[119,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">120]</ref>, but now frequently called Multi-Particle Collision (MPC) dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[121]</ref>, is both lattice and particle based, sharing the advantages and disadvantages of both. The method has two basic steps: (1) a simple constant-velocity streaming flow and (2) an en masse "collision" of solvent particles, in which momentum is exchanged among all particles within each of the cubic cells into which the domain is gridded. In the simplest version of MPC dynamics, this momentum exchange is carried out as follows: the center-of-mass velocity of the particles in each lattice cell is subtracted from the velocities of all particles in that cell. The resulting relative velocities are then rotated through a random angle, which preserves linear momentum within the cell since these rotated velocities retain zero mean velocity. The streaming and collisions steps of the method are given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">r i t þ Δt ð Þ¼r i t ð Þþv i t ð ÞΔt (3.11) v i t þ Δt ð Þ¼u t ð Þ þ Ω v i t ð Þ À u t ð Þ ½ ,<label>(3.12)</label></formula><p>where Ω is the rotation matrix and u t ð Þ is mean velocity in the MPC cell. The position and velocity of the solvent particle i are r i and v i . The rotation process exchanges momentum of particles in the cell, permitting momentum diffusion. Because the momentum is exchanged among many particles (5-10) within a single cell in one step, pair-wise addition of momentum exchange is avoided, as are neighbor lists, making the method much faster, for a given number of solvent particles, than DPD in particular <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[122]</ref>. For the solvent flow, MPC simulations have nonzero inertia and fluid compressibility as potential artifacts, if one is attempting to simulate incompressible Stokes flow. The compressibility of an MPC fluid is greater than for typical DPD fluids, since in MPC the solvent particles have no repulsive interactions and therefore have the compressibility of an ideal gas rather than of a liquid. The Mach number can therefore become high enough to induce significant density changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[122]</ref>. The compressibility of the fluid could of course be countered by applying repulsive interactions between the solvent particles, but this would introduce pairwise momentum exchange during "collisions" and the advantageous speed of MPC dynamics would be lost. So the velocity must be kept low, relative to the thermal velocity of the solvent beads, to prevent unacceptable compression of the fluid. The low velocities mean that runs must be longer to average out Brownian noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[122]</ref>. It also means that the Schmidt number of an MPC fluid, measuring the ratio of momentum to mass diffusivities, is near unity, typical of a gas rather than of a liquid. For objects which are large compared to the typical grid spacing, the small Schmidt number need not be a serious problem.</p><p>MPC dynamics has been applied to colloids by introducing repulsive interactions between large colloidal particles and between solvent and particles <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[123]</ref>. The range of the colloid-solvent repulsion sets the range of depletion interactions that induce shortrange attraction between the colloidsa limitation of the method for hard sphere fluids. A similar limitation exists for DPD fluids, which also use solvent particles to carry momentum. This depletion artifact can be limited by shortening the range of the colloid-solvent interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[123]</ref>. Another, related, problem with MPC fluids, similar to that in DPD fluids, is the limit on its ability to capture short-range lubrication interactions, again set by the range of the colloid-solvent repulsive interaction, which sets the gap between colloidal particles below which solvent particles are squeezed out and lubrication fails. Padding and Louis <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[123]</ref> very thoroughly discuss the dimensionless groups controlling the behavior of colloids in MPC simulations, including relationships among Reynolds number, Mach number, Knudsen number, and how they relate to colloid size, grid size, and solvent mean-free path. The time scales of the method are also thoroughly discussed in the same publication. Schunk et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> have compared predictions of colloidal rheology predicted by LAMMPS versions of MPC with that of Dissipative Particle Dynamics and found much better performance with MPC simulations. MPC simulations have been used to study the transition to a nematic phase in a suspension of rod-like particles <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[124]</ref>, as well as sedimentation dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[125]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.2">Lattice Boltzmann Method</head><p>The Lattice Boltzmann (LB) method was born out of earlier work with lattice gas simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[126]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[127]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[128]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[129]</ref> but with a simple empirical collision operator, such as the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook operator, that greatly increases the flexibility of the LB method <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[128,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">129]</ref>. The novelty in LB simulations relative to other methods is the discretization in momentum space as well as in real space and time, wherein fictitious "particles" carry momentum only in a discrete set of directions with discrete values of the momentum. While resolution of ordinary finite differencing or finite elements is limited by time and space discretization, LB goes "whole-hog" by also losing local resolution in momentum space. Since accuracy is seriously limited anyway at the small length and time scales, the additional loss due to discretization in momentum space is not particularly serious, at least not in comparison to the gain in speed, relative to particle-based methods that retain a continuous distribution of particle momentum, such as in the DPD method or MD simulations. In this sense, as explained by Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[130]</ref> in a chart of simulation methods with resolution of velocity on one axis and computational intensity on the other, LB resides between Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of the Navier-Stokes equation and DPD on the other, with MD simulations on the extreme of high resolution/high computational cost. If one wishes to use the cheapest particle-based method, and does not need or want Brownian fluctuations, the LB method becomes a prime candidate to consider. Of course, there are challenges and limitations to the method. Care is required to perform the discretization properly, and there is a substantial literature on this. For high Reynolds number flows, the BGK (single-relaxation-time) operator leads to artificial instabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[131]</ref>, which can be ameliorated by use of a multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) collision operator <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[130]</ref>. The LB method seems to be technically more demanding than some of the other particle-based methods such as DPD and MPC simulations. However, commercial codes for LB simulations exist, and the LB method is now routinely used in simulations of fluid mechanics problems as a substitute for other standard methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[129]</ref>, and is especially good at allowing tortuous boundary conditions, such as that of porous media. Brief reviews of the method are available elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">128,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">130]</ref>.</p><p>To apply the method to suspensions, Brownian motion can be added, which is not native to the original method. Ladd <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">132]</ref> accomplished this by adding a stochastic contribution to the collision operator, to which improvements were added by Dunweg et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[127]</ref> and Adhikari et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[133]</ref> to ensure equipartition of energy on all length scales. In addition, for suspensions, the transport of momentum across a fluid-solid boundary must be managed. This was initially done by modifying the "bounce-back" rule for stationary surfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">87]</ref> to moving surfaces. Later, it was performed by coupling the motion of the colloidal particle to the fluid through a frictional drag <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">135]</ref>, similar to the method used in the Immersed Boundary (IB) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[136,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">137]</ref>. Discretization of a spherically curved surface is carried out by finding the links between lattice nodes that the curved surface cuts; see Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.9. LB fluid "particles" (which are actually momentum packets) moving along these links interact with the solid at the halfway point along the links, thus producing a discretization that, while not smooth locally, represents the particle more accurately as the grid is refined. Even when the particle diameter is only five times the grid spacing, the hydrodynamic interactions are within 1% of the exact result <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[128]</ref>; except when particles come into close proximity; see Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.10 open symbols.</p><p>Typically sized particles used in LB simulations have radii less than five lattice spacings and, for these sizes, hydrodynamics is not properly modeled when particle separations decrease to 10% of the particle radius or less, which occurs commonly in dense suspensions. Small-separation lubrication corrections have, however, been introduced into LB simulations, resulting in the improvement shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.10 (closed symbols) <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[128]</ref>.

Far-field hydrodynamics. Given the great expense of accounting for them, inclusion of far-field HI is avoided if possible. If one is only interested in equilibrium structures, then far-field (or even near-field) hydrodynamics is unimportant; when dynamics and kinetics is of interest, the inclusion of hydrodynamics becomes important, but must be weighed against its high cost and its importance. Methods that handle far-field hydrodynamics well include the meshed continuum solvent (MCS) methods, Stokesian Dynamics (SD), Accelerated Stokesian Dynamics (ASD), the Boundary Element Method (BEM), and the particle-solvent methods (SPH, DPD, MPC, and LB). 3. Near-field hydrodynamics and particle contact. Near-field hydrodynamics, especially lubrication hydrodynamics, can be accounted for by relatively simple pair-wise interactions between near-neighbor particles only, and hence can be much cheaper to implement for some methods than is far-field hydrodynamics. However, near-field hydrodynamics are sensitive to gap and therefore often require very small time steps to calculate their effects accurately, increasing the expense and difficulty of introducing them, especially in dense suspensions, where the inclusion of near-field hydrodynamics is most important. Methods that describe near-field hydrodynamics well include some of the Domain (DLM/FD) method, and the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) method have versions in which lubrication forces are included. An important special case occurs when lubrication layers are squeezed out altogether and particles come into contact and experience contact friction. These contact forces, which are similar to those dominating granular flows,</p></note></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Summary</head><p>Many methods are now available for the simulation of suspensions and these are often publicly available. The most numerous are available for spherical hard particles in low Reynolds number flows in Newtonian solvents. For these problems, the linearity of Stokes flow is exploited to great advantage and thousands of particles can be simulated accurately with full hydrodynamic interactions in a variety of geometries using "Stokesian particle" methods, of which there are now multiple codes, under continuous improvement. These methods avoid the need to either grid the solvent or replace it by discrete fluid particles, which conveys the great advantage of being able to handle very thin lubrication layers without excessive grid refinement, which is incurred when using methods requiring meshing of a continuum solvent, or the use of huge numbers of small solvent particles when using particle-solvent methods. "Particle-solvent" methods, which capture hydrodynamics through tracking of discrete solvent particles rather than continua, can however be exploited for spherical particles in Stokes flow, either at lower colloid density, or by using counter-measures to allow lubrication films, as, for example, in the "Core-Modified" Dissipative Particle Dynamics method, which simulates both lubricated and frictional contacts. In addition, particle-solvent methods can become favorable over Stokesian particle methods when inertia is present, when the suspended phase is a liquid or a deformable solid, the solvent is viscoelastic, the particles are nonspherical, or multiple of these features are present simultaneously. If the fluid is complex, and high accuracy is not required, solvent particle methods, especially Brownian dynamics (BD), Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD), Multi-Particle Collision (MPC) dynamics, and Lattice Boltzmann (LB) dynamics, are versatile, and can quickly be adapted to problems with great complexity, such as mixtures containing polymers, colloids, emulsions, swimmers, etc. Establishing the accuracy of such methods and which method to use for a given problem remain outstanding problems.</p><p>Methods in which the fluid flow between particles is resolved using a meshed continuum have been covered here in less detail. These include the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method, the Distributed Lagrange Multiplier/Fictitious Domain (DLM/FD) method, the Force Coupling Method (FCM), the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM), Fluid Particle Dynamics (FPD), and the Smoothed Profile Method (SPM). It seems unclear at present how to judge the relative strengths and weaknesses of these methods relative to the others covered here in more detail. It would be valuable in the future to establish benchmark problems by which the relative merits and demerits of the various methods can be assessed. </p></div>
