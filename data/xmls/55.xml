<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Pseudo-halide (PH) anion engineering has emerged as a surface passivation strategy of interest for perovskite-based optoelectronics; but until now, PH anions have led to insufficient defect passivation and thus to undesired deep impurity states. The size of the chemical space of PH anions (&gt;10 6 molecules) has so far limited attempts to explore the full family of candidate molecules. We created a machine learning workflow to speed up the discovery process using full-density functional theory calculations for training the model. The physics-informed machine learning model allowed us to pinpoint promising molecules with a head group that prevents lattice distortion and anti-site defect formation, and a tail group optimized for strong attachment to the surface. We identified 15 potential bifunctional PH anions with the ability to passivate both donors and acceptors, and through experimentation, discovered that sodium thioglycolate was the most effective passivant. This strategy resulted in a power-conversion efficiency of 24.56% with a high open-circuit voltage of 1.19 volts (24.04% National Renewable Energy Lab-certified quasi-steady-state) in inverted perovskite solar cells. Encapsulated devices maintained 96% of their initial power-conversion energy during 900 hours of one-sun operation at the maximum power point.</p><p>The optoelectronic properties of metal halide perovskite materials have enabled rapid progress in solar cell efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">1</ref> . Further increases in power-conversion efficiency (PCE) require improved open-circuit voltage (V OC ), as the short circuit current (J SC ) is now close to the Shockley-Queisser limit <ref type="bibr">2</ref> .</p><p>The V OC of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is curtailed by non-radiative recombination arising due to surface and interfacial trap states. In addition, these defects accelerate PSC degradation, facilitating rapid halide-ion migration <ref type="bibr">3</ref> and chemical reactions with water, oxygen and light <ref type="bibr">4</ref> . Generally, perovskite compounds have a chemical formula ABX 3 , where 'A' is a monovalent cation, 'B' is a divalent cation and 'X' is a halide anion. Ammonium ligands (PEA + , BA + , F-PEA + , among others) <ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">6</ref> are now widely employed for passivation (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). However, this A-site passivation technique commonly demands delicate control over the dimensionality of the two-dimensional layer making up the two-dimensional:three-dimensional heterostructure. Furthermore, associated ligand intercalation has been documented to lead to degradation <ref type="bibr">7,</ref><ref type="bibr">8</ref> .</p><p>More recently, the use of pseudo-halide (PH) anions for X-site passivation has gained attention as it avoids the formation of lower-dimensional phases. X-site defects are more deleterious than A-site defects, motivating a focus onto their passivation <ref type="bibr">9</ref> . However, only a few PH anions have been reported to work well in PSCs <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr">[12]</ref> , a trend that we posited could arise from inefficient passivation and the introduction of unwanted deep impurity states induced by PH anions. This led us to hypothesize that a full search of the associated chemical space could Article <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41563-023-01705-y">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41563-023-01705-y</ref> After two rounds of ML training, we identify four primary features that influence the E b classification, including the number of oxygen atoms (num_O), topological polar surface area (TPSA), hydrogen bond acceptor count (HBA) and highest occupied molecular orbital levels (HOMO). Using these four features, we achieve a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under curve (AUC) score of 0.87 and an accuracy score of 0.84 in the random forest model (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>, top panel, and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>). In the logistic regression model, features with positive coefficients are beneficial for the positive label ('higher E b ' class) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref> and Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure">6</ref> and<ref type="figure">7</ref>). We thus provide a set of guidelines for the binding energy determination: PH anions with more num_O, larger TPSA, more HBA and lower HOMO levels tend to exhibit stronger binding strength with the perovskite surface.</p><p>Physically, a higher num_O provides more active sites to interact with Pb 2+ at the perovskite surface via coordination bonding. For example, we found that PH anions with SO 3</p><p>-functional groups at the head-side tend to have higher binding energy than those with CO 2 -functional groups. More HBA, defined as the sum of atoms in the molecule that contain lone electron pairs participating in the hydrogen bonding <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> , indicates increased likelihood to form hydrogen bonds between PH anions and the NH 3 + group of FA + /MA. TPSA is also linked to the hydrogen bonding (both donor and acceptor groups) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> . The HOMO levels are mostly situated on the electron-rich side, as shown by the red electrostatic potential (ESP) regions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>). Lower HOMO levels usually indicate a higher electronegativity <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> , resulting in stronger electrostatic interaction between the PH anion and a positively charged defect (for example, V I ) on the perovskite surface. Thus, when we progress I -, Br -, Cl -, to F -, the increased electronegativity is accompanied by decreased p-orbital energy levels, and stronger E b (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bifunctional defect passivation mechanism</head><p>We also sought to prevent deep impurity states caused by the PH treatment itself, as they increase non-radiative losses. This prompted us to look for safe functional groups: in the higher E b class (E b &gt; 3 eV), we identify 24 potential PH anions (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3d</ref>) that did not produce localized states near the band edges, regardless of the calculation method level used (see detailed electronic structures in Supplementary Figs. 8-10 and Supplementary Note 2).</p><p>The candidate molecules that emerged prompted us to look at the effect of functional groups on the formation of I Pb anti-site defects (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>), known to lead to deep levels within the bandgap in (MA/FA) PbI 3 perovskites <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> . We found that SO 3 -functional groups cause greater surface-structure distortion that inhibits the passivation of negatively charged I Pb anti-site defects, while CO 2 -prevents the formation of I Pb -but, as previously noted, has a lower surface binding strength.</p><p>To overcome this undesirable trade-off, we explored bifunctional ligands: a head group (electron-rich side) with less surface-structure distortion and anti-site defect generation; and a tail (electron-poor side) engineered to increase binding affinity. In this work, we defined 'bifunctional passivation' as the ability to passivate both positively charged and negatively charged defects at perovskite surface. Specifically, the CO 2 -functional group seemed a good choice for the head-side, providing less steric hindrance and reduced distortion; and either chalcogen-or halogen-containing functional groups for the tail to increase binding affinity. To evaluate candidate tail groups, we calculated the integrated crystal orbital Hamilton population (ICOHP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> , a measure of bonding strength. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>, we found that those with the S atom at the tail-side forms a stronger coordination bond with Pb 2+ than do the other candidates (for example, O-Pb, Cl-Pb and F-Pb). A stronger bond suggests it would cost more energy to break the initial bonding to create I Pb defects. Therefore, it appears that bifunctional PH anions can simultaneously fill donor-like defects V I , while also passivating acceptor-like defects (I Pb ). As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>, there are 15 PH anions having defect formation energies ΔE f (I Pb ) &gt; 0, which are considered as bifunctional ligands.</p><p>potentially uncover new and effective passivants, and thus harness the passivation potential of this diverse class of molecules in PSCs.</p><p>We thus embarked on a systematic search for PH anions exhibiting strong binding to the perovskite surface, which we offer as a surrogate for the degree of passivation. To this, a further criterion was added: the anions should not introduce impurity states in the perovskites. Given the large chemical space, it would be impractical to rely on conventional trial-and-error. Instead we sought a route to study structure-propertyperformance relationships in a high throughput manner <ref type="bibr">13,</ref><ref type="bibr">14</ref> , seeking to understand how the PH anion's chemical structure influences its ability to passivate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Workflow for materials screening</head><p>To accomplish this, we used density functional theory (DFT) on a subset of the chemical space and trained thusly a machine learning (ML) model (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>). First we screened the PH space for experimentally reasonable candidates. A multistep screening funnel considered the charge state (tier 1), molecular weight (tier 2), availability of three-dimensional structures (tier 3), molecular radii (tier 4), presence of Na or K salts (tier 5), and salt purchase availability (tier 6). The rationale for specific threshold values used in the materials screening procedure are discussed in Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. Only 168 PH anions remained out of five million molecules derived from the PubChem database.</p><p>We investigated the interaction between PH anions and the perovskite surface (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>) using FA 0.75 MA 0.25 PbI 3 as a model system for investigation. The PH anions can interact with the perovskite surface via substitution, wherein the PH anion replaces an X (I -) atom; or via adsorption through binding with under-coordinated B 2+ (Pb 2+ ) cations. From formation energies (ΔE formation ) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>), we find that substitution is more thermodynamically favourable than adsorption in most I chemical potential (Δμ I ) regions. This is attributed to the formation of more ionic bonds between Pb 2+ and the electron-rich group of PH anions, as well as more hydrogen bonds between NH 3 + group of FA + /MA + and PH anions. The charge density difference reveals charge transfer between PH anions at the surface and the perovskite slab, indicating that PH anions could attract electrons from neighbouring Pb and MA/ FA atoms (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</p><p>In light of this understanding of the PH anion passivation mechanism, we performed DFT calculations to obtain estimates for the binding energies (E b ) (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>) of PH anions with the perovskite surface. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>, several new PH anions have even higher E b than the 16 anions studied in earlier literature. The calculated E b trends in FA 0.75 MA 0.25 PbI 3 appear to extend well to other perovskite compositions, for example, FA 0.75 Cs 0.25 PbI 3 (normal bandgap), FA 0.75 MA 0.25 Pb 0.5 Sn 0.5 I 3 (narrow bandgap) and FA 0.75 Cs 0.25 Pb(I 0.625 Br 0.375 ) 3 (wide bandgap), as seen in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>. Since higher E b indicates stronger binding strength to iodine vacancies, V I , we expect these candidates to offer enhanced passivation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Machine-learning-model training and analysis</head><p>We then sought to develop a physics-informed machine learning (ML) model to investigate how the molecular structure of PH anions regulates their interaction strength with the perovskite surface. Screened PH anions have diverse electron-rich functional groups, including Jeong et al. reported that the PH anion, formate (HCOO -), had a binding energy of 3.1 eV, resulting in record-performing n-i-p (negative-intrinsic-positive) PSCs, while chloride (Cl -) had a binding energy of 2.98 eV (ref. 10). In light of this, we used 3 eV as a basis to classify 267 PH anions, including our 168 screened p-h anions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>), into high/low E b : thus the PH anions are either labelled as higher E b (201 anions) or as lower E b (66 anions), and these are taken as the ML outputs. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>, we initially considered 19 features of the PH anions as ML inputs (see Methods for ML details). We also sought to calculate the anion migration barrier (∆E a ) at the perovskite surface, as halide migration is one cause of current-voltage hysteresis and decomposition of perovskite films 3 . As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">11</ref>, ∆E a for I -(vacancy mediated) is 0.23 eV (averaged), consistent with previous calculation results <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> . We find that Br -, Cl -and F -have an increased ∆E a of 0.27 eV, 0.32 eV and 0.37 eV, linked to enhanced electronegativity and binding strength with the perovskite surface (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>). The optimal bifunctional PH anions (ligand 14) further increase the ∆E a to 0.43 eV, the result of enhanced binding strength and the additional PH anion, FA + /MA + molecular rotation barrier, the latter absent in halide (I -, Br -, Cl -) migration.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">R-SO 3 - , R-SO 2 - , R-CO 2 - , R-COS -, R-S 2 O 2 - , R-CS 2 - , R-BF 3 - , PO 3 - , R-PO 2 - , R-PHO 3 - , R-S -, R-O -.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Photovoltaic performance of PSCs</head><p>Experimentally, we took five bifunctional PH anions with higher E b for further investigation. We dissolved PH anion salts in a solution of isopropanol (IPA), which we spin coated on perovskite films at 0.5 mg ml -1 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">12</ref>) and then annealed at 100 °C (Methods). We then fabricated inverted PSC devices without and with PH anion treatments (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>). We employed Cs 0.05 FA 0.9 MA 0.05 Pb(I 0.95 Br 0.05 ) 3 perovskite with a bandgap of 1.55 eV as the absorber. The PSCs had an inverted device architecture of ITO/NiO x /Me-4PACz/perovskite/C 60 /BCP/Ag, where ITO is indium tin oxide, Me-4PACz is [4-(3,6-dimethyl-9H-carb azol-9-yl)butyl]phosphonic acid, C 60 is fullerene and BCP is bathocuproine. In PSCs with an inverted (p-i-n) device structure, the interface between the perovskite layer and the electron transport layer (ETL) has been proven to be the most crucial to device performance due to substantial interfacial non-radiative recombination <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> . This motivated us to focus on the use of a PH anion passivation layer at the perovskite/ ETL interface.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b</ref> shows the current density-voltage (J-V) curves for control versus five PH anion-treated devices under forward and reverse scanning. It reveals that sodium thioglycolate (ST) performed the best, though all five PH anions showed improved performance over controls. This we attributed to the optimal bifunctional passivation effect of thioglycolate. Both control and PH anion-treated devices exhibit low hysteresis. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4c</ref> shows device performance statistics using five different PH anion treatments (ST (ligand 14); sodium chlorate (SC) (ligand 2); potassium bicarbonate (PB) (ligand 7); sodium hydroxyacetate (SH) (ligand 13); and monosodium methylphosphonate (MMP) (ligand 12)). We found that the V OC and PCE of these five PH anion-treated devices followed the order: ST best, SC worst, and SH, MMP and PB were in between. This sequence is consistent with the order of the calculated ΔE f (I Pb ) of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>: ST &gt; SH &gt; MMP &gt; PB &gt; SC. The role of sodium was discussed in Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">13</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">14</ref>.</p><p>In ST-treated devices, V OC and the fill factor (FF) were the basis of the improvement, with J SC remaining effectively unchanged. V OC improved from 1.14 V in control to 1.19 V in ST-treated devices and FF increased from 81.9% to 83.6% (see detailed photovoltaic (PV) parameters in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b</ref>). The ST-treated devices had a considerably higher stabilized power output of 24.2% compared with 22.5% for the controls (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">15</ref>). External quantum efficiency spectra (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">16</ref>) verified the J SC values obtained from the J-V </p></div>

We fabricated 15 ST-treated PSCs and the narrow PCE distribution indicates good reproducibility (statistics in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4c</ref>). An ST-treated device was certified at an independent institute, National Renewable Energy Lab, and achieved a quasi-steady-state PCE of 24.04% (V OC = 1.16 V, J SC = 25.12 mA cm -2 and FF = 82.48%) (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">17</ref>). This efficiency ranks amongst the best reported in the literature for inverted PSCs (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Next, we sought to characterize the morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite films to reveal the interaction between the perovskite and the PH anion treatments. Top down and cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that the film morphology remains unchanged after the PH anion treatments (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">13</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">20</ref>). The PH anion treatments did not affect overall crystallinity and perovskite phase, with no erroneous peaks, and lack of correlative peak shifting, broadening, or intensity differences, as evidenced by indexed thin-film and simulated X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">18</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">19</ref>). Additionally, ST and MMP treatments are found to reduce excess PbI 2 , an added benefit for stability (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5a</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">18</ref>). The impact of posttreatment recrystallization on the morphology of perovskite thin films was discussed in Supplementary Note 4 and Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">20</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">21</ref>.</p><p>To ascertain whether our top performing PH anion (thioglycolate) was present following posttreatment, we used X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), whose O 1s peak (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5b</ref>) and S 2p peak (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5c</ref>) suggest that PH anions anchor at the perovskite film surface. Upon ST treatment, a binding energy shift of 0.24 eV and 0.34 eV was observed for the Pb 4f 5/2 and Pb 4f 7/2 orbitals, respectively, indicating a strong interaction between the PH anion and the perovskite surface (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5d</ref>). We provide detailed C, S, Pb, O, Na, N, I and Cs XPS spectra for all five PH anions (ST, SH, MMP, PB and SC) in Supplementary Fig. 22. In addition, we performed sputtering XPS (Methods) on control and ST-treated samples to evaluate the penetration depth of the PH treatment (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">23</ref>) and our results indicate that the thioglycolate anion remained within 5 nm of the perovskite surface, as evidenced by the S 2p peak (Supplementary Note 5).</p><p>To investigate if the thioglycolate treatment leads to defect passivation, we compared the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) of control and ST-treated films. For the PL measurements, we used a glass/ perovskite/PH treatment architecture. The PL emission intensity of the ST-treated film was more than three times higher than that of the control sample (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5e</ref>), indicating that the PH anion treatment reduces non-radiative recombination in perovskite films. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), on average, increased from 20% to 44% upon ST treatment (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">24</ref>), while the remaining PH treatments all exhibited a higher average PLQY over the control (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">14</ref>). We anticipated that the average bulk quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) will rise from 1.23 to 1.26 eV after ST treatment (Methods). The V OC increase (from 1.14 V to 1.19 V) in ST-treated devices is consistent with their increased PLQY. Furthermore, applying the ST PH treatment to a different perovskite composition, namely a narrow-bandgap Cs 0.05 FA 0.7 MA 0.25 Pb 0.5 Sn 0.5 I 3 , was found to result in the highest PLQY over the control and other PH anions (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">25</ref>), hinting at wider applicability of bifunctional PH anions.</p><p>We investigated the long-term operational stability of ST-treated PSC devices under 1-sun-equivalent light-emitting diode (LED) illumination after confirming sufficient longevity under AM1.5 G standards (Supplementary Note 6 and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">26</ref>). These encapsulated devices were biased with fixed resistance loads near the maximum power point (MPP). The ST-treated device retains 96% of its initial PCE after a period of 900 hours (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5f</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">27</ref>). The loss in PCE is primarily due to a decrease in current density, whereas the voltage showed little degradation (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">28</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">29</ref>). The MPP tracking findings are consistent with a picture of mitigated ion migration at the perovskite surface (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c</ref>) and the reduction of PbI 2 in thin-film XRD (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5a</ref>).</p><p>The present study suggests that continued progress in combined computational, ML and experimental efforts has further potential for the discovery of molecular strategies to increase performance in optoelectronics, including photovoltaics, as well as in related light-emitting devices.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Machine learning</head><p>We initially considered 19 features of PH anions as ML inputs: (1) electronic parameters calculated by Gaussian such as lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, HOMO, minimum electrostatic potential and maximum electrostatic potential; (2) structural parameters such as ionic radius (R), length (L a ), breadths (L b ), heights (L c ), molecular polarity index (MPI) and number of elemental species (num_O, num_S, num_F, num_P, num_B, num_C); and (3) fundamental parameters obtained from the Pubchem database such as molecular weight, TPSA, HBA and complexity.

On the basis of input features, we trained and evaluated five different classification ML models, including the random forest model, the gradient boosting classifier model, the XGboost model, the logistic regression model and the support-vector classifier model. The motivations behind choosing classification over regression were discussed in Supplementary Note 7 and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">31</ref>. We set aside 15% of the dataset as a test set, with the rest used as the training set. To avoid overfitting, we selected the ML model hyperparameter using StratifiedShuffleSplit with n_splits = 10 for cross-validation. We also considered regularization in the logistic regression model. We used the ROC AUC score and accuracy score as the evaluation metrics. As listed in Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, the difference in ROC AUC and accuracy scores between the training and test tests was small, indicating a low likelihood of overfitting.

The NiO x nanoparticles were synthesized via the hydrolysis reaction of nickel nitrate referring to our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> . Me-4PACz (0.3 mg ml -1 ) in ethanol was spin coated on the NiO x film at 3,000 r.p.m. for 25 s and then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. We opted to construct a NiO x -Me-4PACz hole transport layer due to the well-documented ability of Me-4PACz to improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs 34 , while NiO x acts to improving the wettability of perovskite on the self-assembled monolayer. Perovskite precursor solution (1.5 M, Cs 0.05 FA 0.9 MA 0.05 Pb(I 0.95 Br 0.05 ) 3 ) was prepared by dissolving the PbI 2 , PbBr 2 , MABr, CsI, and FAI in a mixture of solvents DMF and DMSO at a volume ratio of 4:1. For the perovskite film fabrication, the substrate was spun at 2,000 r.p.m. for 35 s with an acceleration of 1,000 r.p.m. per second at first, and then at 7,000 r.p.m. for the 10 s with an acceleration of 7,000 r.p.m. per second. In the second step, 150 μl Anisole was dropped onto the substrate during the last 5 s of the spinning. The substrate was immediately placed on a hotplate and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. For the posttreatment, the ligands were dissolved in IPA solution with concentration of 0.5 mg ml -1 , the surface treatment was finished by depositing 130 μl organic salts solution onto the perovskite film surface at a spin rate of 4,000 r.p.m. for 25 seconds with a 1,000-r.p.m. per second acceleration. The film was then annealed at 100 °C for 5 min to remove any residual IPA. After cooling to room temperature, the substrates were transferred to the evaporation system, 20 nm C 60 , 8 nm BCP and 140 nm Ag were subsequently deposited by thermal evaporation. For PSCs used in MPP tracking, 8 nm of BCP was replaced with 20 nm of atomic-layer-deposited tin(IV) oxide (ALD-SnO 2 ) to limit environmentally induced degradation (Supplementary Note 8). Deposition of the ALD-SnO 2 was carried out using a PICOSUN R-200 Advanced ALD system. Water and tetrakis(dimethylamino)tin(IV) were used as the oxygen and tin precursors, respectively. The precursor and substrate temperature were set to 75 °C and 85 °C, respectively. Nitrogen gas (90 sccm) was used as carrier gas. The pulse and purge times for water were 1 s and 5 s, respectively, while for tetrakis(dimethylamino)tin(IV), they were 1.6 s and 5 s, respectively. The total number of cycles is 134, corresponding to 20 nm of SnO 2 .</p></div>

J-V curves were measured in a nitrogen atmosphere with a scanning rate of 100 mV s -1 (voltage step of 10 mV and delay time of 200 ms). The active area was determined by the aperture shade mask (0.049 cm 2 for small-area devices) placed in front of the solar cell. A spectral mismatch factor of 1 was used for all J-V measurements.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PLQY measurements and QFLS calculation</head><p>The excitation source was an unfocused beam of a 405 nm continuous-wave diode laser. Photoluminescence was collected using an integrating sphere with a precalibrated fibre coupled to a spectrometer (Ocean Optics QE Pro) with an intensity of ~100 mW cm -2 . PLQY values were calculated by PLQY = P S /(P Ex ⨉ A), where A = 1 - P L / P Ex , P S is the integrated photon count of sample emission upon laser excitation; P Ex is the integrated photon count of the excitation laser when the sample is removed from integrating sphere, and P L is the integrated photon count of excitation laser when sample is mounted in the integrating sphere and hit by the beam. A set of neutral density filters were used to vary the excitation density to correspond to 1-sun illumination. QFLS is calculated by the PLQY values at various excitation light intensities, in this instance, just 1-sun excitation intensity was used: QFLS = k B T ⨉ ln(PLQY ⨉ S ⨉ J G / J 0,rad ) where k B is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature, S is sun-equivalent excitation intensity, J G the generated current density at 1 sun (taken from device J sc ) and J 0,rad the radiative recombination current in the dark (taken from the dark current value from Shockley-Queisser limit). The detailed parameters for calculating QFLS from PLQY are provided in Supplementary Note 10.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table of Contents</head><p>Supplementary Figures 1-34…………………………………………………………2  During the materials screening procedure, we set the molecular radii &lt;5.5 Å and Molecular weight &lt; 300 based on the values for fifteen PH anions reported in prior literature (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>); and the intuition that PH anions with too large molecular radius will be hindered in their occupation of the iodine vacancy site at the perovskite surface. This approach also enables us to exclude heavy elements that are expensive and/or regulated.</p><p>The screening tier Exist as Na or K salts was also included because Na and K salts commonly occur as PH anions found in nature. We should note that we do not rule out the possibility of using other PH anions outside our screening threshold in perovskite solar cells.</p><p>Our primary goal is to select the most possible PH anions for this application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary Note 2: Influence of different calculation methods on the electronic structure</head><p>We performed high-throughput surface electronic structure calculations for the PH anion passivated perovskite surfaces. From Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>, we find that in HCOO -, CF3SO3 -, PF6 -and TsO -substituted perovskite surface systems, the PBE-calculated electronic states of introduced anions are located far from the band edges. We posit that delocalizing charges away from the perovskite surface is beneficial to eliminate charge recombination sites. We then identify 24 potential PH anions with the absence of localized states near the band edges regardless of calculation method levels (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>). As shown in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref>, some PH anions contribute to the band edges or localized states within the bandgap in PBE calculation method. By using HSE+SOC method, we find these states tend to move away from the band edges. We thus do not rule out the possibility that these PH anions will be used in perovskite solar cells. For the experimental test in this work, we simply aim to select the most possible PH anion, i.e., these anions with the absence of localized states near the band edges, independent of calculation method levels (PBE and HSE+SOC).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary Note 3: The role of sodium</head><p>To investigate the effect of sodium, we examined the structure and optoelectronic</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary Note 4: Pre-and post-annealed PH treatments</head><p>To ascertain the extent to which heat-treating the perovskite film impacts the bulk and surface structure, we conducted thin-film XRD and SEM of pre-and post-annealed ST treated thin films. Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">20</ref> shows that the bulk phase and crystallinity of ST treated films remained unchanged before vs. after annealing, whereas using IPA without ST treatment increased the presence of PbI2, highlighting the necessity of heat treating the sample to remove residual IPA, the presence of which acts to degrade the perovskite. In Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">21</ref> we examine the perovskite surface using SEM. There are no discernable differences in grain size; while PbI2 is present on the surface of the pre-annealed ST treated film.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary Note 5: Penetration depth of PH treatments</head><p>We performed sputtering XPS on control and ST-treated samples to evaluate the penetration depth of the PH treatment (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">23</ref>). These results indicate that with a perovskite thickness of approximately 680 nm and a sputtering energy of 0.5 keV, roughly 5 nm of material was removed per sputtering cycle. We observed a rapid transition from surface to bulk chemistry, as evident from the decrease in adventitious carbon and adsorbed oxygen in the C 1s, O 1s signals from cycle one to cycle two (t = 0 to t = 10 seconds). The presence and</p><p>(following the 5 nm sputtering), the disappearance of, the S 2p peak, indicates that the thioglycolate anion was confined to ~ 5 nm of the perovskite surface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary Note 6: MPP stability tracking under AM 1.5G illumination</head><p>Under AM 1.5G illumination, after a period of 200 hours, the PCE of the control device decreased to &lt;88% of its initial PCE, while the ST-treated device retained 94% of its initial PCE (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">26</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary Note 7: Motivations behind choosing classification over regression in ML</head><p>We emphasize the binding energy (Eb) of the PH anions with the perovskite surface, for it is known to be a predictive indicator of the degree of passivation. <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr">[11]</ref> At the same time, it is not the only parameter that affects device performance: in our study, when seeking promising candidates, we also include calculated defect formation energies (Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>) and the predicted density of impurity states (Supplementary Figs. 8-10 and Supplementary Note 2). We posit that an increased defect formation energy indicates better defect passivation effect, and the absence of impurity states at the perovskite surface is beneficial to reduce non-radiative recombination losses.</p><p>In experiments, factors that influence the device performance include the concentration and solubility of salts, annealing temperature, selection of solvents, and the treatment method. All these considerations motivate us to focus in on PH anions in the higher Eb classification for ensuing experimental validation. In addition, in preparing the calculated Eb, we selected the configuration with the lowest energy by considering several different orientations of molecules (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">31</ref>); however, we cannot rule out the possibility of the existence of a metastable configuration in experiments, which will affect the Eb values. Considering that the classification model was found to give higher signal-to-noise ratio than did the regression model, we choose classification rather than regression in ML for this study.</p></div>
