<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structu</head><p>Thin-film photovoltaics play an important role in the quest for clean renewable energy. Recently, methylammonium lead halide perovskites were identified as promising absorbers for solar cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> . In the three years since, the performance of perovskite-based solar cells has improved rapidly to reach efficiencies as high as 15% <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> . To date, all high-efficiency perovskite solar cells reported make use of a (mesoscopic) metal oxide, such as Al 2 O 3 , TiO 2 or ZrO 2 , which requires a high-temperature sintering process. Here, we show that methylammonium lead iodide perovskite layers, when sandwiched between two thin organic charge-transporting layers, also lead to solar cells with high power-conversion efficiencies (12%). To ensure a high purity, the perovskite layers were prepared by sublimation in a high-vacuum chamber. This simple planar device structure and the room-temperature deposition processes are suitable for many conducting substrates, including plastic and textiles.</p><p>The hybrid organic-inorganic methylammonium lead halide perovskites, pioneered by Mitzi, are recognized for their excellent semiconducting properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> . Following the pioneering work of Miyasaka and co-workers 1 , the ease with which these organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite materials can be prepared and processed from solution makes them attractive for photovoltaic applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> . In their studies, the methylammonium lead iodide perovskite was used as a sensitizer in liquid dye-sensitized solar cells and an efficiency of 3.8% was obtained. The low efficiency results from the solubility of the perovskite layer in the iodine/iodide redox electrolyte system. High efficiencies have been realized by replacing the liquid electrolyte with a solid hole-transporting material such as 2,2 ′ ,7,7 ′ -tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9 ′ -spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD), as reported by the groups of Snaith and Graetzel <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> . Interestingly, Lee et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> showed that a mixed-halide perovskite on a mesoporous Al 2 O 3 photoanode acts both as a light absorber and an electron conductor. Etgar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> reported that the pure methylammonium lead iodide perovskite also acts as an efficient hole conductor. Recently, Burschka et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> published a high power-conversion efficiency of 15% for a solar cell in which the perovskite was deposited by a novel sequential deposition technique on a mesoporous TiO 2 film. Ball et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> showed that a thick layer (350 nm) of the mixed-halide methylammonium lead perovskite (CH 3 NH 3 PbI 32x Cl x ) leads to efficient solar cells (12%). They argue that the perovskite functions as the absorber and as the electron and hole transporter. Additionally, it was suggested that the excitons dissociate predominantly in the bulk and not at a donor-acceptor interface. The operating mechanism of planar perovskite solar cells, however, is not clear. For example, it was shown that the photoluminescence of a mixed-halide methylammonium lead perovskite was reduced strongly when either a hole-or an electron-transporting layer was deposited on top of it <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> . A similar effect, but less strong, was observed for thin films of the pure iodide methylammonium lead perovskite <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> . Hence, exciton dissociation may occur both in the bulk and at the perovskite interface. Currently, the dominant process is not established and may well depend on the exact nature of the perovskite film. Up to now, the highest efficiency was reported by Liu et al., who used a thin metal oxide layer and a sublimed perovskite layer that leads to solar cells with an efficiency of 15.4% <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> . High material purity is essential for efficient chargecarrier transport and to prevent exciton quenching, as established in organic light-emitting diodes and organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> . Therefore, in these devices vacuum sublimation is employed frequently to achieve high-purity layers. Solutionprocessed perovskites are generated in situ and therefore may contain imperfections and impurities. Purification of the perovskite layer is not possible as it decomposes on dissolving.</p><p>An inverted layout, similar to that employed in small molecular weight and polymeric solar cells, has also been described <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> . In these bilayer planar heterojunction devices, the perovskite layer was used as the electron donor in combination with an electron acceptor, in analogy to a frequently used OPV layout. The holes are extracted via the transparent conductor poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS). The device performances, however, were significantly inferior to those of devices that employ (mesoporous) metal oxides.</p><p>Here, we present an inverted thin-film solar cell based on a sublimed methylammonium lead iodide perovskite layer sandwiched between two very thin electron-and hole-blocking layers that consist of organic molecules. The organic materials were deposited using solution-based processes, whereas the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 perovskite and the metal contact were deposited using thermal evaporation under vacuum. These simple devices, free of metal oxide and prepared using room-temperature processing, reach efficiencies as high as 12% at 100 mW cm <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> , which demonstrate their potential for a wide variety of photovoltaic applications.</p><p>The CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 perovskite thin film was prepared by coevaporation of the two starting compounds, CH 3 NH 3 I and PbI 2 . Details of the experimental conditions are given in the Methods section. These films were characterized using grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD). Initially, excess PbI 2 was present in the film, yet on optimizing the evaporation process, highly oriented pure CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 films were obtained (see Fig <ref type="figure">1a</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The films adopt the typical tetragonal structure for CH 3 NH 3 MX 3 hybrid perovskites (M ¼ Pb, Sn; X ¼ Cl, Br, I) formed by a three-dimensional anionic framework of PbI 6 octahedra with the methylammonium cations in the interstitial space (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> . The roughness of the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 film was evaluated using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and an image of a typical scan is given in Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>, which demonstrates a smooth film with a root mean square roughness of 5 nm. Figure <ref type="figure">1c</ref> is a photograph of a 20-nm-thick film.</p><p>As the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 layer is prepared via vacuum sublimation, it can be implemented easily in different device architectures. To demonstrate that the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 is capable of performing most of the roles required to obtain an efficient solar cell and to minimize the use of costly organic semiconductors, a simple device structure was chosen. In this structure, which is typical for both organic photovoltaic and light-emitting devices, a semitransparent organic conductor was used as the positive charge-collecting contact. The structure of the device is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>, and consists of a 70 nm PEDOT:PSS layer and a thin layer (,10 nm) of poly(N,N ′ -bis(4-butylphenyl)-N,N ′ -bis(phenyl)benzidine) (polyTPD) (Fig. <ref type="figure">2c</ref>) as the electron-blocking layer. On top of this, the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 was evaporated thermally to a thickness of 285 nm followed by a thin layer (,10 nm) of (6,6)-phenyl C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the hole-blocking layer (Fig. <ref type="figure">2d</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> . The device was completed by the evaporation of an Au top electrode (100 nm). Both the polyTPD and the PCBM layers were deposited using a meniscus-coating process to ensure high-quality films <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> . The thickness of the layers was established using absorbance measurements.</p><p>The relevant energy levels of the materials used to prepare the solar cell are depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>. The valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) of the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 perovskite are 25.4 and 23.9 eV, versus vacuum, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> . On illuminating the device, excitons are generated in the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 perovskite layer. It was reported that excitons in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 perovskites are of the Wannier-Mott type, which implies that they may dissociate in the bulk of the perovskite layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> . Owing to the use of indium-tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS as the hole-collecting contact and Au as the electron-collecting electrode, the built-in voltage of this device is small. Hence, to direct the flow of electrons and holes, thin hole-blocking and electron-blocking layers are incorporated adjacent to the perovskite layer. PolyTPD and PCBM were selected for this role as their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels, respectively, match well with the VB and CB of the perovskite, which allows for a good transport of holes towards the polyTPD and of electrons to the PCBM layer (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>). As the LUMO of polyTPD is significantly closer to vacuum compared with that of the perovskite CB, polyTPD efficiently blocks the flow of electrons. The opposite process, the blocking of holes, occurs at the perovskite-PCBM interface because of the lower HOMO of PCBM compared with that of the perovskite VB. As mentioned above, exciton dissociation may also occur at the perovskite-polyTPD and perovskite-PCBM interfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref> shows the current-voltage (J-V) characteristics of a typical small-area (0.09 cm 2 ) perovskite solar cell measured in the dark and under light intensities of 100, 50 and 10 mW cm <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> . The reproducibility from device to device was excellent, with less than 10% deviation. The short-circuit current density (J SC ), opencircuit voltage (V OC ) and fill factor (FF), respectively, are 16.12 mA cm 22 , 1.05 V and 0.67, which lead to a power-conversion efficiency of 12.04% measured at 100 mW cm <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> . At 50 and 10 mW cm 22 the device exhibited very similar efficiencies, 12.04% and 12.00%, respectively. The high open-circuit potential indicates that there are negligible surface and sub-bandgap states in the perovskite film. The device performance under 100 mW cm <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> is remarkable in view of the very thin perovskite film of 285 nm. A device with cells of larger area (0.98 cm 2 ) was also prepared and evaluated at 100 mW cm 22 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). The J SC and V OC are very similar to the data obtained for the small-area cell (14.76 mA cm 22 and 1.05 V, respectively). The FF, however, significantly lower (0.52), which is the main reason for the lower power-conversion efficiency (8.27%) for these larger cells.</p><p>The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra exhibit 74% (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>) where the generation of photocurrent started at 790 nm, in agreement with the bandgap of the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 . It is interesting that the IPCE spectra show a very steep onset, contrary to the IPCE spectra reported for TiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 mesoscopic-based perovskite cells. A very similar IPCE spectrum as observed for our solar cells was reported for a solar cell based on a perovskite layer sandwiched between a C 60 -modified TiO 2 layer and a layer of poly(3-hexylthiophene) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> . As such, the steep onset may be related to the specific interaction of the perovskite with the fullerene molecules. The IPCE spectrum is almost flat, except for a dip at 630 nm that could result from the oxidized polyTPD acting as a filter or from reduced absorption of the perovskite. Integrating the overlap of the IPCE spectrum with the AM1.5G solar photon flux yields a current density of 16.40 mA cm <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> , which is in excellent agreement with the measured photocurrent density of  16.12 mA cm 22 at the standard solar AM1.5G intensity of 100 mW cm <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> , which confirms that the mismatch between the simulated sunlight and the AM1.5G standard is negligible. The absorbance of the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 film is similar to those reported previously for this material and increases with increasing layer thickness (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>). The absorption extends over the complete visible spectrum up to 800 nm, with a local maximum around 500 nm (the scale of the graph in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref> is optical density).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>An efficient solid-state, thin-film solar cell was obtained by sandwiching a sublimated CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 perovskite layer between two thin organic charge-transporting layers that function as hole and electron blockers, respectively, and contacting it via an indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS as the hole-extraction and an Au electronextraction contact. The simple device architecture, which is an ntype oxide and scaffold free, coupled with easy room-temperature fabrication using economically favourable materials, high efficiency and high reproducibility rivals strongly the established thin-film photovoltaic technologies. The device power-conversion efficiency of 12% at 100 mW cm <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> is remarkable in view of the very thin (285 nm) perovskite film. The high J sc of 16.12 mA cm <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> and the open-circuit potential of 1.05 V reveal that very few electrons and holes recombine, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the hole-and electron-blocking layers. We believe that this new class of perovskite solar cell using organic semiconductors to collect the charges will find widespread applications to rival photovoltaic solar cells based on thin films.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Materials. Photolithographically patterned ITO-covered glass substrates were purchased from NaranjoSubstrates. Aqueous dispersions of PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP Al 4083) were obtained from Heraeus Holding and used as received. Poly-TPD was purchased from ADS Dyesource. PbI 2 was purchased from Aldrich and used as is. CH 3 NH 3 I was prepared similarly to a previously published method <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> ; in brief, CH 3 NH 3 I was synthesized by reacting 21.6 ml methylamine (40 wt% in water; Aldrich) and 30 ml hydroiodic acid (57 wt% in water; Aldrich) in a 250 ml roundbottomed flask at 0 8C for 2 h with stirring. The white precipitate was recovered by evaporation at 50 8C for 1 h. The product, CH 3 NH 3 I, was dissolved in ethanol, filtered, recrystallized from diethyl ether and dried at 60 8C in a vacuum oven for 24 h.</p><p>Device preparation. Devices were prepared on cleaned ITO substrates by spin coating a thin layer of PEDOT:PSS from the commercial aqueous dispersion (1,200 revolutions per minute for 30 s (Chemmat, 3 cm diameter), which resulted in a thickness of 70 nm). On top of this layer a thin film of polyTPD was deposited from a chlorobenzene solution (10 mg ml 21 ) using a meniscus coater and a coating speed of 2.5 mm s 21 . Then the substrates were transferred to a vacuum chamber integrated into an inert glovebox (,0.1 ppm O 2 and ,0.1 ppm H 2 O; MBraun) and evacuated to a pressure of 1 × 10 26 mbar. Two ceramic crucibles were filled with CH 3 NH 3 I (freshly prepared) and PbI 2 , which were heated to 70 8C and 250 8C, respectively. The film thickness was controlled by the PbI 2 evaporation at a rate of evaporation of 0.5 Å s 21 (see Supplementary Information for more details concerning the perovskite evaporation process). The PCBM layer was deposited using a chlorobenzene solution (10 mg ml 21 ) in ambient conditions with a meniscus coater and a coating speed of 10 mm s 21 . The device was completed by the thermal evaporation of the top metal electrode under a base pressure of 2 × 10 26 mbar to a thickness of 100 nm. The solar cells (active area of 0.09 and 0.98 cm 2 ) were then encapsulated with a glass cover using an ultraviolet-curable epoxy sealant (Ossila E131 Encapsulation Epoxy), with an ultraviolet exposure of 5 min.</p><p>Characterization. GIXRD data were collected at room temperature in the 2u range 5-508 on an Empyrean PANalytical powder diffractometer using Cu Ka 1 radiation. Typically, four repeated measurements were collected and merged into a single diffractogram. Pawley refinements <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> were performed using the TOPAS computer program <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> and revealed an excellent fit to a one-phase model with a tetragonal cell (a ¼ 8.80(2), c ¼ 12.57(2) Å) and space group I4/mcm. Additional peaks that correspond to the ITO substrate were also observed. The observed and calculated diffraction patterns for the refined crystal structures are shown in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. Simulation of the crystal structure of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 perovskite was performed using, as a starting model, the isostructural Sn analogue (CCDC ref. code: ZZZBWS02), and modifying the cell parameters to those obtained in the Pawley refinement <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</p><p>Absorption spectra were taken using a fibre-optics based Aventes Avaspec2048 spectrometer.</p><p>Current-voltage characteristics were recorded by applying an external potential bias to the cell and recording the generated photocurrent with a digital source meter (Keithley Model 2400). The light source was a 450 W xenon lamp (Oriel) equipped with a Schott K113 Tempax sunlight filter (Praezisions Glas &amp; Optik) to match the emission spectrum of the lamp to the AM1.5G standard. A black mask was used in the photovoltaic studies to limit the active area of the device. Before each measurement, the exact light intensity was determined using a calibrated Si reference diode equipped with an infrared cut-off filter (KG-3, Schott). IPCE measurements were determined using a 300 W xenon light source (ILC Technology). A Gemini-180 double monochromator (Jobin Yvon) was used to select and increment the wavelength of the radiation that impinged on the cells. The monochromatic incident light was passed through a chopper run at 1 Hz frequency, and the on/off ratio was measured by an operational amplifier. IPCE spectra were recorded as functions of wavelength under a constant white-light bias of approximately 5 mW cm <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> supplied by an array of diodes that emitted white light. The excitation beam from a 300 W xenon lamp (ILC Technology) was focused through a Gemini-180 double monochromator (Jobin Yvon) and chopped at approximately 2 Hz. The signal was recorded using a Model SR830 DSP Lock-In Amplifier (Stanford Research Systems).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure</head><label></label><figDesc>Figure S ovskite,</figDesc></figure>
