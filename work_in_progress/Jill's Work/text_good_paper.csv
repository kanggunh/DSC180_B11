Abstract In recent years, the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells has increased to reach over 20%. Finding an effective means of defect passivation is thought to be a promising route for bringing further increases in the power conversion efficiency and the open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of perovskite solar cells. Here, we report the use of an organic halide salt phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) on HC(NH 2 ) 2 –CH 3 NH 3
mixed perovskite films for surface defect passivation. We find that PEAI can form on the perovskite surface and results in higher-efficiency cells by reducing the defects and suppressing non-radiative recombination. As a result, planar perovskite solar cells with a certificated efficiency of 23.32% (quasi-steady state) are obtained. In addition, a
V OC
as high as 1.18 V is achieved at the absorption threshold of 1.53 eV, which is 94.4% of the Shockley–Queisser limit
V OC
(1.25 V).

Main The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) swiftly increased from 3.8% to more than 20% in 10 years due to composition engineering, perovskite film growth control and perovskite/transport layer interface engineering 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 . To further increase the PCE of PSCs, improvement of the open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) and fill factor (FF) could be more feasible than the short-circuit current ( J SC ), considering that the
J SC
is almost close to its limit (~26 mA cm −2 ) for a bandgap of around 1.55 eV. It is known that the
V OC
of solar cells is strongly related to the recombination of defects in the bulk or on the surface of the absorber layer 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 . Solution-processed perovskite films are usually polycrystalline, which means they contain substantial structural disorder, such as grain boundary defects and crystallographic defects 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 . Although it has been theoretically predicted that most of the defects formed in the perovskite layer are shallow defects 18 , several experimental results have shown that the suppression of defects in solution-processed perovskite films is critical for further enhancing the performance of PSCs towards their thermodynamic limits 9 , 19 , 20 . The surface is the place where defects are most easily formed, and passivation of the surface defects is always the most important task in any type of solar cells 11 , 15 , 21 . In PSCs, several efficient surface passivation methods have been adopted. For example, excess PbI 2
in the perovskite layer, on the surface or at the grain boundary can suppress charge recombination by formation of I-type band alignment 22 , 23 , 24 . Wide bandgap perovskites such as FAPbI 3− x Br x
(ref.
25 ), two-dimensional (2D) perovskite materials, for example, PEA 2 PbI 4
and BA 2 PbI 4
(refs.
26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 ), and super-thin insulated materials such as polystyrene 15
have been utilized. More recently, several halide compounds such as quaternary ammonium halides 11 , diammonium iodide 20 , potassium halide 32
and iodopentafluorobenzene 33
have been employed to passivate dangling bonds in the perovskite layer by exploiting the associated intermolecular interaction. Here, we develop an organic halide salt, phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI), for post-treatment of mixed perovskites FA 1− x MA x PbI 3
(FA: HC(NH 2 ) 2 ; MA: CH 3 NH 3 ) to suppress the surface defects of perovskite polycrystalline films for efficient solar cells. Surprisingly, the organic halide salt PEAI, rather than the 2D layered PEA 2 PbI 4
perovskite proposed in many recent studiess 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , serves as a much more effective passivation additive for a 3D perovskite. We carefully control the conversion process of PEAI to PEA 2 PbI 4
in the actual devices using direct X-ray diffraction (XRD) evidence and show that the existence of PEAI instead of PEA 2 PbI 4
in the perovskite thin-film devices is the key to increasing the
V OC
to as high as 1.18 V, which is 94.4% of the Shockley–Queisser limit
V OC
(1.25 V). As a result, a 23.32% certificated PSC has been achieved. Design and fabrication of the perovskite films The perovskite layer FA 1− x MA x PbI 3
was deposited using a two-step spin-coating method 8 , 24 , 34 , 35 , and the mixed organic salts FAI and MAI were diffused into the PbI 2
bottom layer via annealing. Comparing with previous reports and ours 5 , 8 , 24 , we replaced the methylammonium bromide (MABr) in the traditional high-performance perovskite material (FAPbI 3 ) 1− x (MAPbBr 3 ) x
with methylammonium iodine (MAI) to form FA 1− x MA x PbI 3
perovskites, which is expected to further lower the absorption threshold of the perovskites to absorb more sunlight (Supplementary Fig.
1 ). We found that a small amount of MAI incorporation (8% in precursor) can stabilize the α-phase of FAPbI 3
(Fig.
1c ), which is consistent with the tolerance factor empirical rule 36 , 37 . To introduce a passivation layer, a PEAI salt solution was spin-coated onto the perovskite surface. It is noted that no additional process was carried out for PEAI layer. The device structure of the perovskite solar cells we adopted in this study is shown in Fig.
1a . We infer that the PEAI coating on the perovskite layer fills the iodine vacancies on the surface (Fig.
1b ), and at the grain boundary (Supplementary Fig.
2 ), resulting in passivation of the surface defects and enhancement of the device performance 20 . Fig. 1: Device structure, possible passivation mechanism and states of PEAI on the perovskite surface. a , The device structure adopted in this study. PEAI is used for post-treatment of the perovskite surface.
b , Possible passivation mechanism of the PEAI layer for the perovskite film.
c , GIXRD patterns of perovskite films before and after PEAI treatment. The diffraction patterns of the PEAI powder and of the PEA 2 PbI 4
film are also shown.
d , XPS spectra of the perovskite before and after PEAI treatment, and of the pure PEAI film. The C 1 s
core-level energy spectra are shown for comparison. Full size image Characterization of the perovskite films We carried out grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) for the perovskite films with and without a PEAI layer (Fig.
1c ) to clearly show the states of PEAI on the surface. We found that the diffraction peaks for the perovskite with PEAI treatment are almost the same as for the control film without PEAI. However, a new diffraction peak appeared at 4.7°, which is consistent with the diffraction pattern for PEAI powder, and there is no obvious diffraction peak at 5.4° corresponding to the 2D perovskite PEA 2 PbI 4
(Fig.
1c
and Supplementary Fig.
3 ). It can be concluded that the dominant form of PEAI salt on the perovskite surface is the PEAI crystal itself, which is in contrast to previous reports on the formation of a 2D perovskite on a 3D perovskite surface 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 . We will show that PEAI itself has a much better passivation effect than a 2D PEA 2 PbI 4
thin layer. From scanning electron microscopy results (Supplementary Fig.
2a,b ), we found that the perovskite surface was covered by a PEAI layer. In addition, the roughness of the perovskite layer was reduced from 32 to 24 nm according to atomic force microscopy results (Supplementary Fig.
2c,d ), indicating that the PEAI salt is more easily deposited at the grain boundary (usually, the grain boundary is the deepest place on the surface, Supplementary Fig.
7 ). Therefore, this reduces the height difference between the grain surface and the grain boundary. We conducted X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements to confirm the existence of PEAI on perovskite (Fig.
1d ). For the perovskite with PEAI treatment, in addition to C–C and C–N peaks located at 284.6 eV and 286.1 eV, respectively, we also found that a peak emerges at a binding energy of 292.0 eV, consistent with π−π bonding in the phenyl functional group of the PEA +
cations 26 . We also noticed that the C=O peak (288.1 eV) seen for the control film associated with oxygen/moisture is significantly suppressed after PEAI modification, indicating that the PEAI coating can slow the degradation of the perovskite layer. Furthermore, according to the Pb 4 f
and I 3 d
core-level energy spectra (Supplementary Fig.
4 ), it can be estimated that the Pb:I ratio for the control perovskite film is 1:1.55, which indicates that the surface is seriously iodine deficit, which could lead to obvious point defects (Fig.
1b ). After PEAI modification, the Pb:I ratio dramatically increased to 1:2.34, indicating the presence of abundant iodide on the perovskite surface and that the iodine vacancy is likely to be filled (Fig.
1b ). We monitored the steady photoluminescence (PL) of the perovskite films with PEAI treatment under different conditions (Fig.
2a ). We found that the PL intensities are obviously increased after PEAI treatment without additional thermal annealing, indicating that recombination in the perovskite layer has been largely suppressed 38 , 39 . We also mapped the PL intensities of perovskite films with 470 nm excitation (Supplementary Fig.
5 ), and found that the PL from the perovskite films with PEAI treatment becomes much more intense and uniform compared with the control film. Owing to the strong absorption of perovskite at short wavelengths, we anticipate that only the perovskite surface (<100 nm) is excited when using 470 nm excitation. Therefore, strong PL enhancement indicates that PEAI treatment suppresses the surface non-radiative recombination defects. According to the time-resolved PL results (Fig.
2b , Supplementary Fig.
6
and Supplementary Table
1 ), the carrier lifetime of the perovskite is significantly increased from 0.3 μs to more than 2 μs, and the recombination rate has been reduced by fivefold after PEAI treatment. Fig. 2: Surface passivation of perovskite layer by PEAI. a , Steady PL of the perovskite films with PEAI treatment under different conditions.
b , Time-resolved PL of the perovskite films with PEAI treatment under different conditions.
c , XRD of perovskite films with PEAI treatment under different conditions. Full size image It is interesting that we found that the PL intensity and lifetime of the perovskite films become slightly weaker and shorter when the the PEAI layer is annealed above 50 °C (Fig.
2a,b ). This phenomenon becomes more obvious for thermal annealing of the perovskite/PEAI film at 100 °C (Fig.
2a,b ), and the PEAI-treated perovskite film shows almost the same emission properties as the control film, indicating that the passivation effect has almost disappeared. From the XRD results (Fig.
2c ), we found that the PEAI is gradually converted into the PEA 2 PbI 4
phase during the thermal annealing process, and when the perovskite/PEAI layer is annealed at at 100 °C for 5 min, the PEAI crystal diffraction totally disappears (Fig.
2c ). According to the PL and XRD results (Fig.
2 ), it can be concluded that the PEAI itself shows a much better passivation effect than the 2D perovskite of PEA 2 PbI 4 . Therefore, in this study, we utilized the PEAI layer, not the conventional 2D perovskite 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , to passivate the defects in the perovskite layer. Device fabrication and characterization Keeping in mind that PEAI can efficiently passivate the surface defects in the perovskite layer, we fabricated devices with the structure ITO/SnO 2 /perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au 8 , 24
(ITO: indium tin oxide; spiro-OMeTAD: 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis( N , N -dip-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene). The thicknesses of the electron transport layer SnO 2 , the perovskite layer and the hole transport layer spiro-OMeTAD were about 40 nm, 800 nm and 250 nm, respectively (Supplementary Fig.
7 ). The dependence of the device performance on the PEAI concentration (Fig.
3a , Supplementary Fig.
8
and Supplementary Table
2 ) shows that the PCE jumped significantly when the perovskite films were treated with a low concentration of PEAI solution, and the PCE reached a maximum at 20 mM of PEAI. For this best condition, the mass thickness of the PEAI is about 16 nm when deposited on a smooth silicon substrate (Supplementary Fig.
9 ). It is noted that several tens of nanometres of PEAI films deposited on a very rough perovskite surface (roughness = 32 nm, Supplementary Fig.
2 ) via a solution process cannot be conformal, and the resulting PEAI film should be discontinuous or thin enough for charge transport (Supplementary Fig.
10 ). While the device performance began to drop at high PEAI loading even the recombination rate was low (Supplementary Fig.
6 ), which could be due to the highly insulating properties of PEAI. The typical
J – V
curve of the device with PEAI (20 mM) and without PEAI treatment is shown in Fig.
3b . It can be seen that the
J SC
remains almost the same, while
V OC
substantially increases compared with the control device. We also observed that the hysteresis can be eliminated when the perovskite surface is treated with PEAI. Both the improvement of device performance and elimination of hysteresis could be related to the reduction of the surface defects, which can result in suppression of charge recombination and also charge accumulation 20 . Fig. 3: Device performance. a , The dependence of device performance on concentration of PEAI solution. Reverse scan (1.2 V to 0 V) and forward scan (0 V to 1.2 V) were both collected, and the average of the reverse and forward scans is included.

c , The best device we achieved in our laboratory by optimizing the PEAI condition (20 mM). A 23.56% PCE is achieved with a
V OC
of 1.16 V,
J SC
of 24.9 mA cm −2
and FF of 81.4%.
d , EQE of the best device. The integrated
J SC
from the EQE is 24.5 mA cm −2 . Full size image We tested the device performance when the the PEAI layer was processed at different temperatures and found that the device performance degraded while thermal annealing the PEAI layer (Supplementary Fig.
11
and Supplementary Table
3 ). This is consistent with the PL results (Fig.
2a,b ), confirming that the PEAI itself has a better passivation effect for perovskite layer. We also screened several organic iodine salts for perovskite surface treatment and found that the device performance either showed no significant enhancement or inferior performance compared with the control device (Supplementary Fig.
12
and Supplementary Table
4 ). After optimization of the PEAI-treated device, we obtained the best device with an efficiency of 23.56%, a
V OC
as high as 1.16 V, a
J SC
of 24.9 mA cm −2
and a fill factor (FF) of 81.4% (Fig.
3c ), and there is almost no hysteresis for the device (Supplementary Fig.
13
and Supplementary Table
5 ). The steady output for the best device shows a quasi-steady output of 23.2%, while for the device without PEAI, the output is 21.3% (Supplementary Fig.
14 ). The integrated current density from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) is 24.5 mA cm −2
(Fig.
3d ), which is almost in agreement with the measurement from the solar simulator in this study. In addition, according to the EQE decrease to half the peak value and the differential of the EQE 40 , it can be estimated that the absorption threshold is 1.53 eV. This value is consistent with the result from the differential of absorption (Supplementary Fig.
15 ). The statistics of the PCE distribution confirm the reproducibility of our results and that the PEAI treatment can undoubtedly improve the performance of PSCs (Supplementary Fig.
16 ). We sent the best device to an accredited laboratory (Newport, USA) for certification. The devices showed 23.32% certificated efficiency with a
V OC
of 1.18 V,
J SC
of 25.2 mA cm −2
and FF of 78.4% (Supplementary Figs.
17
and
18 ). Furthermore, it is noted that the certificated efficiency obtained here is the quasi-steady-state efficiency 41 . In this new measurement standard, the
J – V
parameters were measured under a 13-point IV sweep configuration wherein the bias voltage (current for
V OC
determination) is held constant until the measured current (voltage for
V OC ) is determined to be unchanging at the 0.03% level. This is intended to represent the quasi-steady-state performance of the device. We tested the device response under different light intensities (Supplementary Fig.
19 ). We found that both the control and PEAI-treated devices show a linear
J SC
versus light intensity relationship (Supplementary Fig.
19c ). This indicates that carriers can transport smoothly in the device and that there is no obvious charge barrier induced at the interface even though insulating PEAI was introduced. The relationship between
V OC
and light intensity is also plotted (Fig.
4a ). It can be seen that the control device shows a slope of 1.88 k B T / q , while PEAI-treated devices show a much smaller slope (1.27 k B T /q), where
k B
is the Boltzmann constant,
T
is temperature and
q
is the electric charge. It is known that deviation of the slope from
k B T / q
reflects defect-assisted recombination in the devices 42 . These results further confirmed that the recombination has largely been suppressed in the perovskite layer. Fig. 4: Characterization of the devices. a ,

c , EL spectra of the devices with PEAI under different voltage bias operating as LEDs. Inset: EL image of the devices under different voltage bias.
d , EQE of EL of the devices while operating as LEDs. Full size image We derived the charge recombination and transport time constants ( τ r
and
τ t , respectively) from the transient photovoltage and photocurrent decays measured at open and short circuit, respectively 43 . The
τ r
of the PEAI-treated device is as high as 138.2 μs (Fig.
4b ), which is even longer than that of MAPbI 3
perovskite single-crystal devices under one-sun conditions 44 . Furthermore, this value is substantially longer than that of the control device (versus 8.8 μs, Fig.
4b ), which could be attributed to slower surface charge recombination. We also found that the
τ t
slightly decreases from 3 μs to 2.3 μs after PEAI treatment (Supplementary Fig.
20 ). The insertion of insulting PEAI cannot enhance the hole extraction from perovskite to spiro-OMeTAD and decrease
τ t.
Therefore, the slight reduction of
τ t
could also be due to the reduction of charge recombination on introduction of PEAI. A
V OC
as high as 1.18 V is obtained (Supplementary Figs.
17
and
18 ), which is 94.4% of the Shockley–Queisser limit
V OC
(1.25 V) for the absorption threshold of 1.53 eV (ref.
45 ). In addition, there is only 0.35 V of
V OC
loss ( E ab s / q –
V OC ) at the absorption threshold ( E abs ) 1.53 eV, which is even less than that of crystal silicon solar cells (0.38 V) and comparable to GaAs solar cells (0.30 V) 13 . It has been shown that the EQE of the EL of the solar cells under bias voltage (operating as a light-emitting diode (LED)) can be used to estimate the recombination in the devices 45 . Higher radiative recombination emission efficiency could deliver high
V OC
based on the equation: $$V_{{\mathrm{OC}}} = \frac{{k_{\mathrm{B}}T}}{q}{\mathrm{In}}\left( {{\mathrm{EQE}}_{{\mathrm{EL}}}\frac{{J_{{\mathrm{ph}}}}}{{J_{{\mathrm{em}},0}}} + 1} \right)$$
(1)
where EQE EL
is quantum efficiency when the injection current in the dark is equal to the photocurrent ( J ph ) of the device under light illumination and
J em,0
is the current of re-emitted photons at room temperature 45 . We tested the solar cell device operating as a LED in the dark and under a voltage bias. We found that PEAI-treated devices showed obvious EL and an emission peak located at 805 nm (Fig.
4c ). Furthermore, the device can even emit under lower applied voltage (1.2 V), which is lower than the absorption threshold of perovskite (1.53 eV)—the apparent violation of energy conservation could come from heat extracted from the diode 46 . It is encouraging that the device showed close to 7% EL efficiency under an injection current of 25.2 mA cm −2
(equal to short-circuit current
J SC  =  J ph ) (Fig.
4d
and Supplementary Fig.
21 ). For comparison, the control device only shows 0.8% EL efficiency under same injection current (Fig.
4d
and Supplementary Fig.
21 ). Based on equation (1), it can be estimated that the
V OC
improvement (Δ V OC ) after PEAI treatment is: Δ V OC  =  k B T / q In(EQE PEAI /EQE without PEAI ) = 0.056 V. This result is almost consistent with the
J – V
results, while the control and PEAI-treated devices showed
V OC
around 1.12 V and 1.18 V, respectively. We also calculated the internal quantum efficiency of the devices, which were 9.7% and 50.4% for the control and PEAI-treated devices, respectively, according to the relationship between external and internal emission 47 , 48 . This result shows that the non-radiative losses in the perovskite layer have been significantly suppressed by PEAI passivation. We could increase the
V OC
close to its limit (1.25 V) if we could fully suppress the non-radiative recombination in the perovskite layer, on the surface or at the interface, and then the PCE of PSCs could be improved beyond 25%. Stability of the devices We tested the device stability at 85 °C for more than 500 h (Fig.
5 ). A more thermally stable hole transport layer poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) was used to replace spiro-OMeTAD for thermal stablility testing 49 , 50 . The initial PCE of the PEAI-treated devices with a PTAA hole transport layer was 19.1% (Supplementary Fig.
22
and Supplementary Table
6 ), which is lower than the best device performance using spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transport layer. This is a common issue and could be addressed in future studies. We found that the PCE of the PEAI-treated device decreased at the start of several hours of annealing at 85 °C, and then the performance remained almost constant up to 500 h of heating. Time-resolved PL for the perovskite films/hole transport layer showed that the lifetime of the perovskite layer was significantly shortened in minutes after heating at 85 °C (Supplementary Fig.
23 ). This is fully consistent with the results shown in Fig.
2b . Then there is no obvious change when the heating time is extended to hours (Supplementary Fig.
23 ). The shortening of lifetime during heating could be ascribed to the disappearance of the passivation effect by converting PEAI into PEA 2 PbI 4
according to Fig.
2 , which results in device performance degradation during heating. These results showed that the thermal stability of PEAI-based devices is not good enough, and that other passivation materials with good thermal stability should be screened. We also preliminarily tested the device stability under continuous light soaking at the maximum power point (25 °C, 100 mW cm −2 ) and found that there is no obvious decrease in device performance over 40 h (Supplementary Fig.
24 ). Fig. 5: Thermal stability of the devices. The thermal stability (85 °C) of the devices with and without PEAI layers. Up to 500 h stability was tested. PTAA was used to replace spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transport layer for thermal testing. The device performance without PEAI has been divided by the initial device performance of PEAI-based devices, and the initial performance of the devices with PEAI has been normalized. The starting efficiency of the cells is 19.1% and 17.2% for the devices with and without a PEAI layer, respectively (Supplementary Fig.
22
and Supplementary Table
6 ). For each type of device, ten devices were utilized for the thermal stability test, 5% of error bars has been adopted. Full size image In summary, we have provided an efficient and simple method for passivation of the perovskite surface through which the defects are significantly reduced and the recombination is suppressed. As a result, a 23.32% certificated efficiency was obtained by adopting a low-temperature solution-processed planar structure. This method could be helpful for obtaining low-cost, efficient and highly flexible solar cells. Methods Materials SnO 2
colloid precursor (tin ( iv ) oxide, 15% in H 2 O colloidal dispersion) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and lead iodine (PbI 2 ) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Formamidinium iodide (FAI), methylammonium bromide (MABr), methylammonium iodide (MAI), methylammonium chloride (MACl) and phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) were all purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology in China. Solar cell fabrication ITO glass was cleaned by sequentially washing with detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol (IPA). Before use, the ITO was cleaned with ultraviolet ozone for 10 min. Then the substrate was spin-coated with a thin layer of SnO 2
nanoparticle film (2.67%, diluted by water) at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s, and annealed in ambient air at 150 °C for 30 min. It is better to clean the substrate with ultraviolet ozone for 10 min to improve the surface wetting. After that, 1.5 M of PbI 2
in DMF:DMSO (9:1) solvent was spin-coated onto SnO 2
at 1,500 r.p.m. for 30 s, then annealed at 70 °C for 1 min, and then cooled to room temperature. For FAMAPbI 3
perovskite film deposition, a solution of FAI:MAI:MACl (90 mg:6.39 mg:9 mg in 1 ml IPA) was spin-coated onto the PbI 2
at spin rate of 2,000 r.p.m. for 30 s, followed by thermal annealing at 150 °C for 15 min in ambient air conditions (30–40% humidity). For comparison, a (FAPbI 3 ) 1− x (MAPbBr 3 ) x
mixed perovskite were also synthesized. A solution of FAI:MABr:MACl (90 mg:9 mg:9 mg in 1 ml IPA) was spin-coated onto the PbI 2
at spin rate of 2,000 r.p.m. for 30 s, followed by thermal annealing at 150 °C for 15 min in ambient air conditions (30–40% humidity). After perovskite formation, the samples were transferred to a nitrogen-filled glove box for further processing. For PEAI treatment, the PEAI solution was dissolved in IPA with different concentrations ranging from 0 mM to 60 mM and spin-coated onto the perovskite surface at a spin rate of 5,000 r.p.m. without any further processing. Then the hole transporting layer was deposited on top of the perovskite layer at a spin rate of 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s using spiro-OMeTAD solution, which consisted of 72.3 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 35 μl bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI) stock solution (260 mg LiTFSI in 1 ml acetonitrile), 30 μl 4-tertbutylpyridine and 1 ml chlorobenzene. For the device thermal stability test, PTAA doped with poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (TPFB) was used to replace spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transport layer. The concentration of PTAA was 30 mg ml −1
and the weight ratio of PTAA/TPFB was 10:1 (ref.
50 ). The PTAA was deposited on top of the perovskite layer at a spin rate of 2,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. Finally, 80 nm of Au film was thermally evaporated as a counter electrode using a shadow mask. The device size areas were 0.108 cm 2 . When measuring, a 0.0739 cm 2
non-reflective mask was used to define the accurate active cell area. Material and device characterization The scanning electron microscopy images was acquired using a field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FEI NanoSEM650), which uses an electron beam accelerated at 500 V to 30 kV, enabling operation at a variety of currents. Atomic force microscopy measurements were carried out using a Solver P47 PRO. The XRD patterns of the perovskite thin films were obtained on a Rigaku D/MAX-2500 system using Cu Kα radiation ( λ  = 1.5405 Å) as the X-ray source. Scans were taken with a 0.5-mm-wide source and detector slits, with X-ray generator settings at 40 kV and 30 mA. For conventional XRD, a
θ −2 θ
model was used. For the GIXRD measurement, the incident angle was 0.5°. Absorption spectra were obtained using an ultraviolet–visible spectrometer (Cary 5000). Steady-state PL was measured by a FLS980 spectrometer. Time-resolved PL spectra were obtained using a F900 spectrometer. XPS was performed on a Thermo Scientific ESCALab 250Xi using 200 W monochromated Al Kα (1486.6 eV) radiation. A 500 μm X-ray spot was used for XPS analysis. The base pressure in the analysis chamber was about 3 × 10 −10  mbar. For the PL mapping, a laser scanning confocal microscope (Enlitech, SPCM-1000) equipped with a 470 pulse laser and galvo-based scanner was used. The objective was ×50 with numerical aperture of 0.8; for this objective, the confocal pinhole was set to 50 μm size. The detector was a photo-multiplier tube (Hamamatsu) with a photon-counting module. The laser source was set to 1 μW range on the sample for measurement. Transient photocurrent and photovoltage measurements were measured on a home-made system similar to that previously reported 8 . For the device operating as a LED, the device was mounted in an integrating sphere and the power output measured for calculation of the EQE (Enlitech, LQE-50-PL). The
J – V
characteristics of the photovoltaic cells were obtained using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter under simulated one-sun AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm −2 ) with a solar simulator (Enlitech, SS-F5-3A) and the light intensity was calibrated by means of a KG-5 Si diode. The
J – V
measurements were carried out in ambient air. The devices were measured both in reverse scan (1.2 V → 0 V, step 0.02 V) and forward scan (0 V → 1.2 V, step 0.02 V). The EQE was measured using an Enlitech EQE measurement system (QE-R3018). We sent the best devices to an accredited laboratory (Newport, USA) for certification. The device thermal stability tests were carried out in a nitrogen glove box, and the devices were put on a hotplate with a temperature of 85 °C.

Abstract The solution process has been employed to obtain Ruddlesden–Popper two-dimensional/three-dimensional (2D/3D) halide perovskite bilayers in perovskite solar cells for improving the efficiency and chemical stability; however, the solution process has limitations in achieving thermal stability and designing a proper local electric field for efficient carrier collection due to the formation of a metastable quasi-2D perovskite. Here we grow a stable and highly crystalline 2D (C 4 H 9 NH 3 ) 2 PbI 4
film on top of a 3D film using a solvent-free solid-phase in-plane growth, which could result in an intact 2D/3D heterojunction. An enhanced built-in potential is achieved at the 2D/3D heterojunction with a thick 2D film, resulting in high photovoltage in the device. The intact 2D/3D heterojunction endow the devices with an open-circuit voltage of 1.185 V and a certified steady-state efficiency of 24.35%. The encapsulated device retained 94% of its initial efficiency after 1,056 h under the damp heat test (85 °C/85% relative humidity) and 98% after 1,620 h under full-sun illumination.

Main Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a strong candidate for future photovoltaic technology owing to their remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE), which exceeds 25%, and easy fabrication at low temperatures 1 , 2 . However, achieving higher performance with long-term stability for commercial use is still a challenge. The strategy of forming Ruddlesden–Popper 2D perovskite layers on the surface of a 3D light-absorbing perovskite layer has recently drawn attention 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 . This strategy has the advantages of reducing surface defects by surface passivation 3 , 4
and forming a 2D/3D heterojunction 5 , 6 , 7 . However, the formation of unidentified phases and an unintended quasi-2D phase hinders the design of an adequate electric field distribution at the junction 8 , 9 . The 2D/3D junction should be carefully designed on the basis of photoelectrical properties such as the bandgap and work function 10 . It is also necessary to develop fabrication processes that can ensure an effective and stable junction, considering the competitive long-term stability and production cost of solar cell devices 11 , 12 . The general chemical formula of Ruddlesden–Popper 2D and 3D metal iodide perovskites is (A*) 2 A n – 1 Pb n I 3 n +1
and APbI 3 , respectively, where A* is a large organic cation with a long carbon chain and A is a small organic cation such as CH 3 NH 3 +
or HC(NH 2 ) 2 +
(refs.
13 , 14 ). The symbol
n
indicates the number of [PbI 6 ] 4 −
octahedral monolayers between the organic spacer A* layers and hereby the phase can be classified into three cases: a 2D perovskite ( n  = 1, (A*) 2 PbI 4 ); a quasi-2D perovskite (1 <  n  <  ∞ , (A*) 2 A n – 1 Pb n I 3 n +1 ); and a 3D perovskite ( n  =  ∞ , APbI 3 ) 15 . The 2D phase with
n  = 1 is known to be the most stable as the organic spacers are repeated most often 16 . There have been many attempts to fabricate PSCs with high PCE and stability using 2D perovskites, including mixing a 2D precursor with a 3D precursor solution 17 , 18 , 19
or forming a 2D/3D bilayer via the reaction of a 2D precursor solution on the surface of a 3D layer 3 , 5 , 6 . However, these solution processes thus far inevitably form an unintended quasi-2D phase that negatively affects the PCE and stability 16 . In this study we devised a solid-state in-plane growth (SIG) method for growing a 2D layer on a 3D layer by applying pressure and heat to ensure the intact properties of both layers in the complete device. Although pressure-assisted crystallizations of perovskite layers have also been reported before, they have been carried out in a system that includes a liquid-state precursor 20 , 21 , 22 . The SIG process successfully avoids the formation of unintended phases and can adjust the thickness of the 2D layer. The controllability of the thickness of the intact 2D layer facilitates device optimization for increasing the built-in potential at the junction. The stable 2D layer entirely formed on a 3D surface can maximize the stability enhancement effect. SIG process Figure
1a
shows a schematic of the procedure of the SIG process. A solid-state 2D film is stacked on top of a 3D film so that their surfaces are in contact. Heat and pressure are then applied perpendicular to the joint surface to induce a supply of the 2D perovskite from the stacked solid 2D precursor film to the top of the 3D film. Two-dimensional seeds are formed at the initial stage and gradually grow on the 3D film in the in-plane direction, becoming a new 2D film. After a specific process time passes, the original 2D solid precursor is detached and then an intact 2D/3D bilayer is finally formed. The characteristics of the SIG are compared to the conventional solution process in Supplementary Table

at each condition. Scale bars in

represent 1 µm and 400 nm, respectively. Source data Full size image For the SIG process, 2D (BA) 2 PbI 4
and 3D (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05
(where FA is formamidinium and MA is methylammonium) films were prepared on substrates. All of the SIG processes were performed at 60 MPa, except for the experiment examining the influence of pressure. The temperature condition is marked after SIG (for example, SIG30 denotes the SIG process at 30 °C and 60 MPa). Figure
1b–f
displays scanning electron microscopy (SEM) plan-view images of the SIG60-processed films as a function of the processing time. The SEM image of a SIG60 2 min case (Fig.
1c ) provides a glimpse of the initial state, with tiny seed-like products appearing on the 3D surface. The seeds subsequently became enlarged and gradually filled the 3D surface (Fig.
1c–e ). The substance completely covered the 3D surface after 10 min (Fig.
1f ). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results for the same SIG films in Supplementary Fig.
1
support that the planar material observed in the SEM images is (BA) 2 PbI 4 . Only one new peak appears at 6.4° from 2 min to 10 min, which gradually grows over time. This peak corresponds to the (002) plane of (BA) 2 PbI 4
(ref.
23 ) and corresponds with the peak of the original precursor 2D film, revealing that the new 2D film is sourced from the original solid precursor 2D film. Moreover, in Supplementary Fig.
2 , the cross-sectional high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image for the SIG60 10 min film also shows that a crystalline 2D film is successfully formed on top of the 3D film without interfacial interaction. As seed formation and growth are generally governed by thermodynamic and kinetic factors, we monitored variations in the (BA) 2 PbI 4
film formation on the 3D layer with processing pressure, temperature and time to understand the SIG procedure. The pressure aided intimate contact between the two films and allowed the formation of the initial seeds, which moved from the original 2D film. We observed no occurrence of 2D perovskite accretion on the 3D surface in the absence of pressure (Supplementary Fig.
3 ). The pressure also promotes the in-plane growth of the 2D layer. Figure
1g–i
shows plan-view SEM images for the SIG60 films after 10 min under different pressures. The 2D crystal was still in the process of formation at 20 MPa, whereas it was almost wholly planarized at 60 MPa. The temperature also strongly influences crystal formation and growth. Figure
1j
shows the thicknesses of the 2D films for SIG30 and SIG60 over time. It is notable that thickness increment in the out-of-plane direction hardly occurs over time, even when the processing time is extended to 720 min. This suggests that the seeds grow in the in-plane direction while the height of the initial seeds is maintained over time, probably due to 2D material characteristics. Comparing SIG30 and SIG60, the processing temperature determines the final thickness of the SIG-2D film as the initial height of the seeds is highly dependent on the temperature and their growth has a strong preference for the in-plane direction. As a result, a thicker 2D layer was created at a higher temperature, as shown in Supplementary Fig.
4 . According to classical nucleation theory, the nucleation and growth of a crystal from the initial precursors can be explained by the differences in the Gibbs free energy due to the volume and surface area changes of the newly formed crystal 24 . In the SIG process, however, a new crystal is not created as a 2D crystal already exists in the stacked original 2D precursor film. We therefore surmise that there would be no free energy changes caused by volume changes, but a surface area change can still occur when the original crystals surrounded by the 2D precursor film change into 2D seeds on the 3D surface. The newly formed surface area of seeds is determined by the balance between the increased free energy and the supplied thermal energy. As a result, the temperature can determine the initial seed height and final thickness of the SIG-2D film (Fig.
1h
and Supplementary Fig.
4 ). We also observed that the seeds did not manage to grow into a 2D film at 20 °C, whereas at 30 °C they succeeded (Supplementary Fig.
5 ), indicating that sufficient thermal energy is required for the in-plane growth. The anisotropic surface energy of the 2D materials also probably affects the in-plane growth without a thickness increase 25 . Formation of an intact 2D/3D multilayer Figure
2a
displays the XRD results for the control 3D film, the original 2D (BA) 2 PbI 4
film and the SIG-2D/3D bilayer films formed at different temperatures. All of the SIG films show the (002) peak typical of (BA) 2 PbI 4
(at approximately 6.4°) without other peaks for an unknown or quasi-2D phase. The (002) peak grows with the increase in the 2D film thickness, which is determined by the processing temperature. The original 2D film has a very narrow full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 0.105° for the (002) peak, and the SIG-2D films on top of the 3D surfaces also show a small value of ~0.167°, including an estimated instrumental broadening of 0.061° at 6.4° (2 θ ) (Supplementary Table
2 ). It is notable that the FWHM values for SIG-2D films are considerably smaller than the reported FWHM values of above 0.50° for the (002) peak of the 2D layers obtained by conventional solution processes 5 , 17 , 26 , 27 . The SIG process enabled the formation of a several-tens-of-nanometres-thick upper layer containing a highly crystalline pure 2D phase on top of a 3D layer. The absence of secondary phases and a clear 2D/3D interface in the HRTEM image (Supplementary Fig.
2 ) reveal that the SIG process can produce an intact 2D/3D multilayer. We also showed that the SIG process could be valid for pure FAPbI 3
and MAPbI 3
perovskites, thus showing its wide applicability (Supplementary Fig.
6 ). Fig. 2: Properties of the 2D/3D films fabricated by the SIG method. a , X-ray diffraction patterns of the control film (3D perovskite only), 2D/3D films developed by the SIG process under different temperature conditions, and a pure 2D perovskite film ( n  = 1, (BA) 2 PbI 4 ).

The colour-scale bars indicate average carrier lifetime whereas the greyscale bars indicate event counts. Source data Full size image Reduction of surface recombination via SIG Figure
2b
shows the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay curves of the control 3D and SIG films. The first-order decay related to trap-assisted non-radiative recombination can be identified by fitting the exponential decay within the photoluminescent tail region 28 , 29 . The detail fitting process and results are presented in Supplementary Note
1
and Supplementary Fig.
7 , respectively. The obtained recombination constants and lifetimes are summarized in Supplementary Table
3 . The SIG process enhances the lifetime of the first-order recombination up to approximately 1.1 μs (from the 0.2 μs control) regardless of the processing temperature. This means that the SIG process reduces trap-assisted non-radiative recombination and that the processing temperature does not influence the carrier lifetime. The reduction of surface defects seems to be independent of the SIG-2D film thickness as the contact area between the 2D and 3D materials is constant. The change in the average carrier lifetime with processing time is also represented by lifetime mapping in Fig.
2c–e . The blue region with a short lifetime gradually transitions to a green region with a longer lifetime. The partial green region indicates the area that was partially covered by the 2D seeds after 2 min; after 10 min the 2D film had covered all of the area via in-plane growth. The TRPL results reveal that the 2D film successfully passivated the surface of the 3D film via the SIG process. Details on the device performance will be discussed later, but the point to note in the TRPL results is that the improved lifetime of 1.1 μs is insufficient to achieve a high open-circuit voltage ( V OC  ≈ 1.185 V) for the SIG devices in this study according to a previous study on
V OC
(ref.
30 ; Supplementary Note
2 ). Furthermore, the fact that
V OC
increases as the SIG-2D thickness increases (despite the similar lifetimes of 1.1 μs) has us consider the contributions from other factors to the improvement of
V OC . Design of the local electric field at the 2D/3D junction In addition to surface passivation, the electric field generated by the intact 2D/3D junction can improve the performance of PSCs. The electric field can be designed by controlling the semiconducting properties and thickness of the 2D layer; however, the existing solution process has difficulty forming a clear 2D/3D junction for shaping the optimal electric field 7 . This is because the solution process is based on the reaction between the 2D precursor (A*I) dissolved in a solvent and the 3D (APbI 3 ) upper part. The reaction has the problem of producing quasi-2D phases (A*) 2 A n – 1 Pb n I 3 n +1
(1 <  n  <  ∞ ) 8 , 31
and not producing a pure 2D (A*) 2 PbI 4
phase, as the PbI 2
required for reaction with (A*I) must be supplied by the 3D layer, leaving (AI) according to equation ( 1 ). Existing solution process: $$2\left( {{\mathrm{A}}^\ast {\mathrm{I}}} \right) + n\left( {{\mathrm{APbI}}_3} \right) \to \left( {{\mathrm{A}}^\ast } \right)_2{\mathrm{A}}_{{{n}} - 1}{\mathrm{Pb}}_{{n}}{\mathrm{I}}_{3{{n}} + 1}(1 \le n < \infty ) + \left( {{\mathrm{AI}}} \right)$$
(1)
SIG process: $$\left( {{\mathrm{A}}^\ast } \right)_2{\mathrm{PbI}}_4 + \left( {{\mathrm{APbI}}_3} \right) \to \left( {{\mathrm{A}}^\ast } \right)_2{\mathrm{PbI}}_4/\left({{\mathrm{APbI}}_3} \right)$$
(2)
On the other hand, the SIG process produces a definite and highly crystalline 2D ( n  = 1) perovskite on the 3D perovskite without any reaction with the 3D surface according to equation ( 2 ), which is also confirmed by the above-mentioned XRD and HRTEM studies. The SIG process can not only form an intact 2D/3D junction, but also control the thickness of the 2D layer through the processing temperature or an iteration process; the electric field thus becomes designable. We conducted the SIG and solution processes twice (iteration process) to assess the potential for electric field design by ensuring an adequate 2D thickness. Figure
3a–c
shows the grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) images of the control 3D film, the solution-processed (twice) 2D/3D film, and the SIG60-processed (twice) 2D/3D film. As expected, the solution-processed film shows broad peaks, indicating the generation of a quasi-2D with an undefined phase (Fig.
3b ). By contrast, our SIG-processed film consistently shows only one sharp peak that corresponds to pure (BA) 2 PbI 4
(Fig.
3c ). This implies that the target 2D material can be grown on the 3D surface in any desired thickness using repetition of the SIG process. We also observed a uniform and intact 2D/3D bilayer over the entire surface of the SIG film from a slightly tilted cross-sectional SEM image (Fig.
3d ). Fig. 3: Intact 2D/3D heterojunction formation and its role. a – c , GIWAXS patterns of the 3D perovskite film (control) ( a ) and 2D/3D perovskites made by two cycles of the solution ( b ) and SIG ( c ) processes.

Full size image The electric field distribution at the intact 2D/3D junction is determined by the semiconducting properties (such as the carrier concentration and work function) of the 2D and 3D films. Figure
3e
presents the position of each band and work function for 2D and 3D films that were estimated via ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy data and the Tauc plot from the ultraviolet–visible absorption spectrum (Supplementary Figs.
8
and
9 ). Most FAPbI 3 -based perovskites have been reported to be p-type materials 32 , 33 , and the 3D perovskite we used exhibited p-type properties in the previous report on Hall measurements 6 , 34 . The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy result also shows that the Fermi level (4.81 eV) of the used 3D perovskite is slightly lower than the midpoint between the CBM (conduction band minimum) of 4.01 eV and VBM (valence band maximum) of 5.56 eV. (BA) 2 PbI 4
has also been reported to be a p-type material according to finely controlled scanning Kelvin probe microscopy measurements 35 . (BA) 2 PbI 4
has a wider bandgap of 2.38 eV and a higher work function of 4.92 eV than the corresponding values (1.55 eV and 4.81 eV, respectively) for (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 . The 2D/3D junction can therefore be interpreted as a p–p isotype heterojunction and its band bending is represented in Fig.
3f
according to the explanation in Supplementary Fig.
10
and Supplementary Note
3 . Formation of a p–p isotype heterojunction is a typical way of inducing a back-surface field at the junction between a wide-bandgap p-type field-induced layer and a narrow-bandgap p-type light-absorbing layer 36 , 37 . In the 2D/3D heterojunction, (BA) 2 PbI 4
and (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05
correspond to the wide-bandgap p-type field-induced material and narrow-bandgap p-type light-absorbing material, respectively. Here the junction must be designed such that sufficient thickness of the field-induced layer is ensured, as when the p–p heterojunction is formed, the intrinsic hole movement from the field-induced layer to the light-absorbing layer must be sufficient to form a satisfactory back-surface field. The back-surface field can be represented by the built-in potential ( V bi ) in the depletion region of the wide-bandgap p-type layer. When the wide-bandgap p-type layer is thin enough to be fully depleted,
V bi
is dependent on the thickness of the wide-bandgap p-type layer, as described in Supplementary Note
3 . We estimated the 2D thickness for forming a sufficient depletion region and
V bi
using Supplementary equation ( 5 ) for different carrier concentrations of the 2D layer, and the result is presented in Supplementary Fig.
11 . The depletion region depends on the carrier concentration of the 2D layer; however, an increase in the thickness of the 2D layer could augment the additional
V bi
by further ensuring the depletion region in the 2D layer. A thicker intact 2D layer was therefore expected to provide a higher photovoltaic performance for the PSCs obtained through the SIG process. Performance and stability of PSCs Figure

shows the current density–voltage ( J – V ) curves and a summary of the cell parameters, such as the short-circuit current density ( J SC ),

and fill factor for both the control and SIG60 devices with a FTO/SnO 2 /perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au structure (where spiro-OmeTAD is 2,2ʹ,7,7ʹ-tetrakis( N , N -di-4-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9ʹ-spirobifluorene and FTO is fluorine-doped tin( iv ) oxide). The SIG60 device shows considerably improved
V OC
compared with the control device, thus yielding an improvement in the PCE from 22.39% to 24.59%. It also shows negligible
J – V
hysteresis and a stabilized power output at the maximum power point (Fig.
4a
and Supplementary Fig.
12 ) and a certified efficiency in terms of the
J – V
PCE (24.59%;
J SC , 24.70 mA cm – 2 ;
V OC,
1.185 V; fill factor, 83.90%) and quasi-steady-state PCE (24.35%;
J SC , 24.83 mA cm – 2 ;
V OC , 1.173 V; fill factor, 83.59%) without any encapsulation by Newport (Supplementary Fig.
13 ). As the 2D perovskite layer thickness increased from 0 nm (control) to 40 nm (SIG30) and 80 nm (SIG60), the
V OC
increased from 1.098 V to 1.117 V and 1.185 V, and the PCE increased gradually (Supplementary Table
4 ). The
J SC
values were similar—regardless of the thickness of the SIG-2D film—and were in accordance with the integrated
J SC
values from the external quantum efficiency spectra (Supplementary Fig.
14 ). The fill-factor value slightly improved from 82.95% to 83.90% despite an increase in the series resistance from 5.39 to 6.60 Ω cm −2
(Supplementary Fig.
15 ). This implies that the positive effect of the surface passivation and the back-surface field of the 2D layer was superior to the negative effect of the series resistance for the fill factor. The statistical data in Supplementary Fig.
16
also show that the improvement of
V OC
is reproducible and critical for the high PCE of the SIG60 device.

2b
indicate that in addition to the reduction of surface recombination, other factors are involved in the
V OC
improvement. The band bending at the 2D/3D heterojunction in Fig.
3f
can have a positive effect on the
V OC , similar to the back-surface field of GaAs solar cells. We executed Mott–Schottky plot analysis to confirm the
V bi
alteration in the SIG device 38 . The details of the procedure for selecting the parameters are described in Supplementary Fig.
17
and Supplementary Note
4 . Reliable Mott–Schottky plots were obtained for control and SIG devices in Supplementary Fig.
18 . In Fig.
4b , the Mott–Schottky plots for the control and SIG60 devices show that the introduction of the 2D/3D junction enhances
V bi
through the SIG process compared with the control device and the
V bi
increases from 1.087 V to 1.194 V as the thickness of the 2D layer increases. Comparing the measured
V bi
with the
V OC
for SIG devices in Supplementary Table
5 , the increase in
V OC
has a similar trend to the increase in
V bi
with increasing 2D thickness despite the similar photoluminescence carrier lifetimes. This result reveals that the
V bi
obtained by employing the 2D layer was designable by the 2D layer thickness and was critical for
V OC
enhancement. This result is notable because controllability of the 2D layer thickness on top of the 3D layer has not been demonstrated before. We observed that the calculated
V bi
values—with a carrier concentration of the 2D layer of 1.67 × 10 16  cm –3 —are significantly similar to the differences in the measured
V bi
and
V OC
between the control and SIG devices in Supplementary Table
5 . This result clearly indicates that the increase in
V OC
with the thickness of the 2D layer is associated with increasing
V bi
in that a thicker 2D layer forms a thicker depletion region (Supplementary Fig.
19 ). Consequently, the SIG-(BA) 2 PbI 4
layer could exhibit a thickness of several tens of nanometres while maintaining its inherent properties such that it enabled an improvement in the device performance. We also confirmed that the
V bi
provided by the SIG-2D layer worked well for other hole-transporting systems, such as poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) (Supplementary Table
6 , and Supplementary Figs.
20
and
21 ). The SIG device was expected to enhance the resistance against the external environment. The reason is that organic spacers that prevent the penetration of moisture 39
and suppress the leak of volatile cations and halides from 3D perovskite film are arranged in the surface direction 40 , and the pure ( n  = 1) state has a superior heat resistance to the quasi-2D phases that are usually produced by the solution process. The reactivity with moisture for the control (FTO/SnO 2 /3D) and SIG-grown (FTO/SnO 2 /3D:SIG-2D) films was estimated by measuring the ultraviolet–visible absorbance before and after exposure to 85% relative humidity and room temperature. Supplementary Fig.
22
shows that the SIG film maintained its absorbance even after 1,000 h, in contrast to the control film. The humidity stability test of the device was also conducted by placing the fabricated devices with undoped P3HT as the HTL in a chamber at 85% relative humidity and room temperature (Fig.
4c ). Here, undoped P3HT was used to avoid the effect of hygroscopic additives in spiro-OMeTAD, and the initial device performance is shown in Supplementary Fig.
20 . The unencapsulated SIG device (FTO/SnO 2 /3D:SIG-2D/P3HT/Au) showed only 2.7% (average) degradation compared with the initial PCE after 1,083 h, whereas the unencapsulated control device (FTO/SnO 2 /3D/P3HT/Au) showed 41.4% degradation only after 400 h. We also observed that the unencapsulated SIG device (FTO/SnO 2 /3D:SiG-2D/spiro-OMeTAD/Au) stored under an air atmosphere at room temperature in the dark maintained its initial PCE even after 7,000 h. Figure
4d
presents the results from the damp heat test of the SIG device with encapsulation under 85 °C/85% relative humidity. PTAA was used for the damp heat test, and device performance is shown in Supplementary Fig.
21 . The most stable encapsulated SIG device (FTO/SnO 2 /3D:SIG-2D/PTAA/Au) maintained 95% (on average 93%) of its initial PCE of 21.34% after 1,056 h. The pure 2D phase grown by the SIG process enabled thermal stability that could not be otherwise achieved with the solution process 41 . The encapsulated SIG device was tested near the maximum power point under full-sun illumination to explore its long-term operational stability at room temperature (Supplementary Fig.
23 ). The SIG device maintained >98% of its maximum efficiency (24.06%) for 1,620 h. The intact 2D/3D heterojunction leads to excellent operational stability. Conclusion We have developed an SIG strategy that enables the formation of an intact 2D/3D halide junction showing remarkable performance enhancement of PSCs in terms of efficiency and stability. The SIG process allows thickness-controllable deposition of a highly crystalline 2D (BA) 2 PbI 4
( n  = 1) layer on top of a 3D layer without any quasi-2D phases ( n  > 1). The formed intact 2D/3D halide junction increases the carrier lifetime and enables the design of the local electric field distribution at the junction, yielding a significant improvement to
V OC
in PSCs. The PSCs with the intact 2D/3D junction show a remarkably improved PCE of 24.59% (a certified quasi-steady-state PCE of 24.35%). The intact 2D ( n  = 1) layer not only improves the humidity and thermal stability, but also allows excellent operational stability for PSCs under the 1 sun condition. We anticipate that the SIG strategy will open new avenues for designing halide–halide junctions to improve both the PCE and stability of PSCs. Methods Materials Lead iodide (PbI 2 ) and lead bromide (PbBr 2 ) were purchased from the Tokyo Chemical Industry. Methylammonium bromide (MABr), methylammonium chloride (MACl) and formamidinium iodide (FAI) were purchased from Dyesol. Lead( ii ) oxide (PbO), butylamine (CH 3 (CH 2 ) 3 NH 2 ), hydriodic acid (HI, 57 wt% in H 2 O), hypophosphorous acid solution (H 3 PO 2 , 50 wt% in H 2 O), anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF), anhydrous dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), chlorobenzene and acetonitrile were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Spiro-OMeTAD was purchased from Lumtec, P3HT was purchased from 1-Material and PTAA was purchased from Mott–Schottky solution. Synthesis of (BA) 2 PbI 4
crystal powder A mixed solution of HI solution (16 ml) and H 3 PO 2
solution (2 ml) was prepared in a 200 ml glass volumetric flask. PbO powder (2,232 mg, 10 mmol) was dissolved by heating to boiling under stirring, and it formed a bright yellow solution; 993 μl (10 mmol) of butylamine was then added to this solution and stirring was discontinued. The temperature was lowered to 80 °C over 30 min. The solution was left at room temperature until orange crystals began to form. The crystals were isolated by suction filtration and thoroughly dried in a vacuum chamber. (BA) 2 PbI 4
perovskite film fabrication Tin-doped indium oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates of 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm were cleaned with deionized water, acetone, ethanol and isopropyl alcohol for 15 min each. For better wetting of the 2D perovskite precursor solution, the substrates were treated with ultraviolet-ozone for 15 min; (BA) 2 PbI 4
precursor solution was then prepared by dissolving 0.172 g ml –1
(BA) 2 PbI 4
crystal powder in DMF/DMSO (8:1 v/v) mixed solvent. The precursor solution was then spin-coated on the substrate at 5,000 r.p.m. for 20 s; 1 ml of diethyl ether was quickly poured onto the substrate at 10 s. The yellow film was quickly transferred to a hot plate and heat-treated at 100 °C for 5 min. 3D perovskite film fabrication FTO (Pilkington, TEC8) substrates of 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm were cleaned with deionized water, acetone, ethanol and isopropyl alcohol for 15 min each. The substrates were cleaned with ultraviolet-ozone for 15 min and a SnO 2
layer was subsequently grown as the electron transport layer according to a previous report 42 . The substrates were then heat-treated at 150 °C for 1 h. For better wetting of the precursor solution of the 3D perovskite, the FTO/SnO 2
substrates were treated with ultraviolet-ozone for a further 15 min. The 3D perovskite precursor solution was then prepared by mixing 0.869 g ml –1
FAPbI 3 , 0.035 g ml –1
MAPbBr 3
and 0.028 g ml –1
MACl in DMF/DMSO (8:1 v/v) mixed solvent. The precursor solution was then coated onto the FTO/SnO 2
substrates by two consecutive spin-coating steps at 1,000 r.p.m. and 5,000 r.p.m. for 5 s and 30 s, respectively; 1 ml of diethyl ether was quickly poured onto the substrate at 10 s after reaching 5,000 r.p.m. The yellow film was quickly transferred to a hot plate and heat-treated at 150 °C for 10 min. SIG process A hot-press method was used to fabricate the 3D/SIG-2D film. The previously fabricated (BA) 2 PbI 4
thin film was placed on the 3D thin film and pressed at 60 MPa for 10 min at the desired temperature (30 °C, 45 °C or 60 °C). For the purpose of analysing the growth of the SIG-processed 2D film under different pressures, 3D/SIG-2D thin films was made by changing the pressure (20 MPa, 40 MPa or 60 MPa) at 60 °C. Hole transport layer and counter electrode fabrication Spiro-OMeTAD solution (1.1 mg ml –1
in chlorobenzene) with the addition of 23 μl of bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) (540 mg ml –1
in acetonitrile), 10 μl of cobalt-TFSI (375 mg ml –1
in acetonitrile) and 39 µl of 4-tertbutylpyridine was spin-coated on the substrate coated with FTO/SnO 2 /3D/(SIG-2D) at 2,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. Undoped P3HT solution (10 mg ml –1
in the mixed solvent chlorobenzene:diphenyl ether = 97:3 v/v) was used for the humidity stability test, whereas PTAA solution (12 mg ml –1
in toluene) with the addition of 6 μl of Li-TFSI (340 mg ml –1
in acetonitrile) and 6 μl of 4-tertbutylpyridine was used for the damped heat test. Finally, a gold counter electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation; the active area of the counter electrode was fixed at 0.16 cm 2 . Material and film characterization X-ray diffraction spectra were measured using a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer with an X-ray tube (copper Kα,
λ  = 1.54 Å, 200 mA, 45 kV, 9 kW). All of the XRD patterns were measured under a scan rate of 1° per min with a step of 0.02° at the National Center for Inter-university Research Facilities at Seoul National University. Plan-view and cross-sectional SEM images were obtained by using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (MERLIN, Carl Zeiss). A cross-section view near the 2D/3D heterojunction was observed using a transmission 200 kV field-emission electron microscope (JEOL, JEM-2100F). A TRPL study was performed using an inverted-type scanning confocal microscope (MicroTime-200, Picoquant) with a ×40 (air) objective. Lifetime measurements were performed at the Korea Basic Science Institute, Daegu Center. A single-mode pulsed diode laser (32.7 μJ cm – 2 ; 470 nm with a pulse width of ~30 ps, a laser power of ~0.1 μW, a repetition rate of 0.5 MHz and an effective confocal area of 6.11 × 10 – 9  cm 2 ; ref.
43 ) was used as an excitation source. A dichroic mirror (490 DCXR, AHF), a 75 μm pinhole and a single-photon avalanche diode (PDM series, MPD) were used to collect emission from the samples. The time-correlated single-photon counting technique was used to count emission photons. Time-resolved photoluminescence images consisting of 200 × 200 pixels were recorded using the time-tagged time-resolved data acquisition method and the exponential fitting of the obtained photoluminescent decays was performed using Symphotime-64 software (version 2.2), according to the method used in ref.
43 . GIWAXS patterns were obtained from the Wide Angle X-ray Scattering Spectrometer (XEUSS2.0, Xenocs at National Instrumentation Center for Environmental Management at Seoul National University. The X-ray wavelength was 1.54 Å and the incidence angle of the X-ray was set to 0.1°. Two-dimensional GIWAXS data were recorded with a DECTRIS hybrid pixel photon counting detector. Device characterization To estimate the solar cell performance, photovoltaic cells were measured using a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel ClassAAA, 94043 A) with a source meter (Keithley 2420) of 100 mA cm −2
under AM 1.5 G illumination and a calibrated silicon reference cell certificated by NREL;
J – V
curves were obtained in the forward and reverse directions from –0.2 V to 1.2 V and measured at 100 mV s –1
and 10 mV step intervals. The photovoltaic performance measurements were performed at room temperature under air. The devices were covered with a metal mask to set the active area to 0.094 cm 2 . The external quantum efficiency was measured from 320 nm to 900 nm at an interval of 5 nm (QuantX-300, Newport). For Mott–Schottky analysis, capacitance–voltage measurements were carried out at a fixed frequency (10 kHz) (IviumStat, IVIUM TECHNOLOGIES). A Mott–Schottky plot was obtained in the forward direction from –0.2 V to 1.2 V. The active area of the counter electrode was calibrated to 0.16 cm 2 . Device stability testing For continuous humidity stability tests, an unencapsulated device was stored in a thermo hygrostat chamber (TH-PE, JEIO TECH) with 85% relative humidity at 25 °C. The photovoltaic performance of the aged devices was measured under ambient conditions. Encapsulation was performed to measure the stability under 85% relative humidity at 85 °C. The SIG device and glass cover were attached using ultraviolet induced resin in a N 2
glove box. The stability test under 85% relative humidity at 85 °C was then carried out in the chamber. The long-term operational stability test was performed with a current and voltage monitor (INA219, Adafruit) under an AM 1.5 G simulated white LED (LSH-7320, Newport). The long-term operation test system was operated by a self-customized program. Reporting Summary Further information on research design is available in the

Abstract Many of the best-performing perovskite photovoltaic devices make use of 2D/3D interfaces, which improve efficiency and stability – but it remains unclear how the conversion of 3D-to-2D perovskite occurs and how these interfaces are assembled. Here, we use in situ Grazing-Incidence Wide-Angle X-Ray Scattering to resolve 2D/3D interface formation during spin-coating. We observe progressive dimensional reduction from 3D to
n  = 3 → 2 → 1 when we expose (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95
perovskites to vinylbenzylammonium ligand cations. Density functional theory simulations suggest ligands incorporate sequentially into the 3D lattice, driven by phenyl ring stacking, progressively bisecting the 3D perovskite into lower-dimensional fragments to form stable interfaces. Slowing the 2D/3D transformation with higher concentrations of antisolvent yields thinner 2D layers formed conformally onto 3D grains, improving carrier extraction and device efficiency (20% 3D-only, 22% 2D/3D). Controlling this progressive dimensional reduction has potential to further improve the performance of 2D/3D perovskite photovoltaics.

Introduction 2D/3D metal halide perovskite solar cells make use of active layers comprised of 3D perovskites capped by a thin layer of 2D or quasi-2D perovskites—also known as reduced-dimensional perovskites (RDPs). Devices based on these materials have been shown to have superior stability imparted by the RDP capping layer 1 , 2 , 3 : RDPs exhibit improved stability relative to 3D analogs due to higher formation energies and favorable intermolecular bonding between ligand molecules 4 , their ability to suppress ion migration 5 , 6 , and hydrophobic ligands that can repel water 7 . 2D/3D interfaces can also improve fill factor and open-circuit voltage by passivating trap states, improving carrier extraction, and altering band alignment 8 , 9 , 10 . 2D/3D interface formation is predominantly achieved through solution-processing (vacuum-processing has also been demonstrated 11 ), in which a 3D perovskite layer is first deposited and annealed, and the surface is then exposed to a solution containing a low concentration of large ammonium cations (also referred to as ligand molecules) which transform part of the surface into RDPs (Fig.  1a ). The thickness of these RDPs is designated by the number of layers ( n ) of perovskite octahedra that are enclosed by the ligand cations in the crystal structure. Purely 2D ( n  = 1) RDPs are almost ubiquitously formed in 2D/3D structures, with smaller proportions of
n  = 2 often observed as well 1 , 2 , 12 . The crystallinity and quality of the interface is also greatly affected by solvent: mixtures of isopropanol (needed to dissolve the ligand) and nonpolar solvents like chlorobenzene or chloroform are often used, although the isopropanol component can cause some redissolution of the 3D perovskite interface that is deleterious to performance 13 .

n
value. Full size image Despite the widespread use of 2D/3D interfaces to augment perovskite device performance, their formation mechanism remains unclear. The perovskite lattice components are known to be highly labile 14 , 15 , and cation exchange and insertion reactions can occur at room temperature 16 , including full conversion of pure PbI 2
into
n  = 1 or
n  = 2 by exposure to ligand solutions 17 , suggesting a similarly low activation barrier for 2D/3D interface formation—but how the 3D perovskite is fragmented into low- n
RDPs, and whether this proceeds through intermediate states, is unknown. We sought to gain insight into the formation mechanism of 2D/3D interfaces using in situ grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), which can inform on the orientation and
d -spacing of any diffractive species that form during the spin-coating of the ligand solution. In situ GIWAXS has been used previously to study the formation of 2D or 3D perovskites directly from precursors in solution, tracking the formation of intermediate states and precursor complexes that eventually transform into perovskite 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 . Here we instead use this technique to probe the transformation of the already fully-formed 3D perovskite surface into RDPs, by collecting diffraction patterns before, during, and after exposure of the 3D perovskite to a solution containing 2D ligand cations. Results and discussion XRD and in situ GIWAXS We used the ligand cation 4-vinylbenzylammonium bromide (VBABr, Fig.  1b ), which we have shown forms 2D/3D interfaces with RDPs that exhibit strong diffraction, and greatly improves the efficiency and stability of photovoltaic devices 10 , 12 . To obtain
q
values for the diffraction peaks of low- n
RDPs, we first spin-coated thin films of
\(\left\langle n\right\rangle\)  = 1, 2, and 3 directly from RDP precursor solutions using the composition (VBABr) 2 (FA 0.95 MA 0.05 ) n−1 Pb n (I 0.95 Br 0.05 ) 3 n +1 , which has the same cation and anion composition as the 2D/3D films used throughout this work. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for these films are shown in Fig.  1c . The (001) diffraction peaks of
n  = 1 and 2 were found to have
q  = 0.37 Å −1
and 0.29/0.30 Å −1 , respectively, while an (001)
n  = 3 peak could not be observed for these samples. The
n  = 2 peak experiences a small shift in the
\(\left\langle n\right\rangle\)  = 3 film, possibly due to strain. These
q
values are similar for analogous films using the MA- and iodine-only composition (VBABr) 2 MA n−1 Pb n I 3 n +1
(Supplementary Fig.  1 ), indicating that the RDPs with multication and multianion composition have minimal shifting of their characteristic (001) diffraction peaks. The diffraction peak positions we observe for
n  = 1 and 2 are also very similar to those we have previously measured and simulated for RDPs using the ligand phenethylammonium, PEA (owing to the structural similarity of PEA and VBA) 21 , where we found
n  = 3 PEA RDPs to diffract at
q  = 0.22 Å. We assume a similar peak for the
n  = 3 VBA RDPs here. We next used in situ GIWAXS in order to gain insight into the formation of the 2D/3D interface. Measurements were performed at the Brockhouse Beamline 22
at the Canadian Light Source using a custom homebuilt spinning platform (see Supporting Information for details of the experimental setup and execution). In situ GIWAXS patterns for films of MAPbI 3
treated with a solution of 5 mg/mL VBABr in isopropanol (IPA) are shown in Fig.  2a . Time zero is taken to be the frame where spinning was engaged and the ligand solution is removed from the surface. In the initial frame ( t  = −6 s), we observe the expected isotropic diffraction from the (110) plane of 3D MAPbI 3
at
q  ≈ 1.0 Å −1 , and also a smaller amplitude peak at
q z  ≈ 0.9 Å −1 , which corresponds to PbI 2 . After soaking the surface with the ligand solution for ~6 s, the spinning is turned on at a speed of 1000 r.p.m. At
t  = 1.05 s after spinning is initiated, a peak at
q z  ≈ 0.50 Å −1
is observed, which then ( t  = 2.10 s) decays simultaneously with growth of a peak at
q z  ≈ 0.37 Å −1 . This diffraction peak—which corresponds to the (100) plane of
n  = 1—then remains constant through to the end of the experiment, which can be seen from a contour map of azimuthally integrated GIWAXS patterns (Fig.  2b ). The diffraction peaks for both the transient intermediate peak and the
n  = 1 peak are strongly centered along
q xy  = 0, indicating that the species are oriented parallel with the substrate, which is often observed for low- n
RDPs 3 , 10 , 21 , 23 . Fig. 2: In situ GIWAXS patterns for (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95

treated with a solution of 1 mM VBABr in 3:97 IPA:CF. Patterns were collected with an incident angle of 0.1˚. Full size image These experiments indicate that
n  = 1 is not directly formed from the MAPbI 3
but rather transitions through an intermediate state. The peak at
q z  ≈ 0.50 Å corresponds to a
d -spacing of 12.6 Å, which is too large to be attributed to PbI 2
and too small to be attributed to an RDP ( n  = 1 has the smallest
d
of ~17 Å, and higher
n
RDPs have progressively larger
d
as the thickness increases). Kim et al. observed a highly similar peak with
q  ≈ 0.55 Å −1
that was also oriented along
q z , during thermal degradation of MAPbI 3
into PbI 2
and other decomposition products 24 . This peak is attributed to 2D PbI 2
sheets that are intercalated by MAI or solvent molecules. We therefore posit that either IPA from the ligand solution or MAI that is being displaced from the perovskite lattice are the species that intercalate into PbI 2
sheets. This is supported by additional experiments using ligand solutions containing chlorobenzene (CB) with IPA:CB solvent ratios of 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3. When CB is included in the solvent, we do not observe the intermediate species, indicating that IPA intercalates with PbI 2
to form the intermediate species during 2D/3D interface formation. This suggests that these PbI 2
sheets template the subsequent formation of
n  = 1 RDPs, consistent with the fact the diffraction peaks for the intercalated PbI 2
and
n  = 1 are identical in shape and therefore orientation. Control experiments using only IPA as the exposure solution confirmed that this peak only appears when ligands are included (Supplementary Fig.  2 ), meaning cation displacement by the ligand molecules is also required to form this intermediate intercalated PbI 2 . We observe a very different 2D/3D transformation from in situ GIWAXS experiments on multication and multianion perovskites of composition (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 . Compared to MAPbI 3 , multication and -anion compositions achieve higher PCEs in photovoltaic devices 3 , 13 , 25 . Accordingly, in order to best simulate the 2D/3D interfaces used in our devices 10 , we used a solution of 1 mM VBABr (~214.11 µg/mL) in 3:97 IPA:chloroform (CF). A lower proportion of IPA reduces perovskite dissolution and surface trap state density 13 , and a lower concentration of ligands results in thinner RDP layers, which is favorable for carrier extraction and fill factor 11 , 12 . To compare fairly with our results from MAPbI 3 , we also performed experiments with (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95
using 5 mg/mL VBABr in IPA, and observed no intermediate state before the formation of
n  = 1 (Supplementary Fig.  3 ). A contour map of azimuthally integrated in situ GIWAXS patterns and four of the full patterns are shown in Fig.  2c and d . In contrast to MAPbI 3 , rather than observing an intermediate at higher
q , we instead observe a small but discernible peak that is overlapped with the specular reflection near
q z  ≈ 0.22 Å ( d  ≈ 28.6 Å). This peak is only visible for a single frame before disappearing simultaneously with the appearance of another peak at
q z  ≈ 0.30 Å ( d  ≈ 20.9 Å), which remains for ~1 s before transforming into a peak at
q z  ≈ 0.37 Å ( d  ≈ 12.6 Å). The three peaks are similar in shape and all oriented along
q xy  = 0. These
d -spacings correspond to (001) diffraction planes of
n  = 3, 2, and 1 RDPs. In order to more clearly observe these transitions, we took the average of the first three frames of the experiment—which contained diffraction from the 3D perovskite, PbI 2 , and the specular reflection—and subtracted them from all subsequent frames. A contour map of azimuthally integrated GIWAXS patterns and traces near time zero are shown in Fig.  3 . We can see that the subtraction cleanly removes the specular reflection at low
q
values, evidenced by first pattern in Fig.  3b
which corresponds to the frame before the solvent exposure. Examining the patterns between
q z  = 0.15–0.45 Å reveals the distinct peak at
q z  ≈ 0.22 Å in the earliest frames after spinning is initiated, and clearly shows the evolution of
n  = 3 → 2 → 1 in the first few seconds of spinning. The
n  = 3 → 2 → 1 transition is most apparent when using the 1 mM VBABr 3:97 IPA:CF solution, but a clear
n  = 2 → 1 transition is also observed when using 5 mg/mL VBABr in a mixture 1:3 IPA:CB (Supplementary Fig.  4 ). Fig. 3: Background subtraction revealing
n  = 3. a

b
Patterns taken from within the dashed box indicated in panel
a . The first pattern labelled with an asterisk is taken directly before the solvent exposure, confirming the effectiveness of subtracting the average of the first three frames. Full size image Our experiments thus suggest that for (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95
films, the transformation from 3D perovskites into RDPs occurs through a progressive reduction of dimensionality, rather than the immediate formation of
n  = 1. It is possible that even higher
n
RDPs are formed initially, but the (001) diffraction peaks for these species would be at too low
q
to be observed in our experiment. Moreover, in such a sequence of reducing dimensionality, we would expect diffraction of larger RDPs to be weaker, since there would initially be few instances of adjacent and periodic high- n
RDPs, but once they split into lower- n
RDPs, these structures would be immediately adjacent to each other, thus promoting diffraction 21 . Considering the small percentage of bromine in the (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95
films, we posit that the difference in the 2D/3D transformation pathways arises due to the greater stability of FAPbI 3
compared to MAPbI 3 , where the latter is known to exhibit poorer thermal stability due to loss of volatile species under thermal stress and is more easily converted to PbI 2 26 , 27 . DFT simulations of interface formation and stabilization In the multication films, we hypothesize that ligand molecules are able to infiltrate into and bisect a part of the 3D surface into high- n
domains, which undergo further bisection into lower- n
RDPs. We illustrate such a process in Fig.  4a . Further studies would be required to probe and confirm more microscopic picture of ligand infiltration and sequential bisection of the 3D lattice, where the terminating cations along the surface are replaced by the ligand molecule.

binding energies at 2D/3D interfaces formed by a VBA-terminated
n  = 1 fragment sandwiched between 3D fragments terminated by MA (blue), PbI 2
(green), and VBA (red). Full size image This idea is, however, supported by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, where we calculated the binding energy of two perovskite fragments at their interfaces while their surfaces are converted from MAI-terminated to VBA-terminated (see Supporting Information for computational methods). These structures are shown in Fig.  4b , and a plot of the binding energy versus number of incorporated VBA molecules is shown in Fig.  4c . The binding energy increases, approximately linearly, with each VBA ligand substituted into the interface, from −0.10 eV for 1 VBA and up to −3.14 eV for 16 VBAs. If we gauge the reaction energies per VBA molecule insertion, the values are in −0.10, −0.11, −0.12, −0.14, and −0.20 eV for the systems with 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 VBA molecules, respectively, showing that the thermodynamics become increasingly favorable due to the π–π stacking of the VBA molecules. We also examined binding energies at the interfaces between a fragment of
n  = 1 terminated by VBA and a 3D fragment terminated by MA, PbI 2 , and VBA (Fig.  4d ), which we found to be −1.85, −1.84, and −3.06 eV, respectively, again demonstrating the favorable thermodynamics of VBA-VBA compared to other surface terminations of the 3D perovskite. This binding energy likely results from phenyl ring stacking: such interface stabilization via ligand interactions has been noted previously for RDPs using PEA ligands, and was invoked to explain the improved stability of low- n
RDPs compared to higher- n
and quasi-3D structures 4 . We additionally calculate binding energies considering more commonly used cations butylammonium (BTA) and PEA (Supplementary Fig.  5 ). The binding energies with 16 BTA and PEA molecules are −2.43 and −2.70 eV, respectively. The reaction energies per BTA and PEA insertion are −0.15 and −0.17 eV, respectively, compared to −0.20 eV for VBA. This supports our assertion that extended π–π stacking at the interface makes the interface growth more thermodynamically favorable. Here, we posit that the same ligand interactions are what cause the ligand molecules to bisect the 3D lattice and form an interface between two fragments, and thus drives 2D/3D interface formation. Influence of 2D/3D formation on photovoltaic efficiency Lastly, we examined the influence of the different ligand solutions on photovoltaic device performance. Devices were fabricated in an
n-i-p
architecture comprised of ITO/SnO 2 /3D perovskite/RDPs/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au, following refs.

J–V
curves for devices with 2D/3D active layers fabricated with different solvent conditions are shown in Fig.  5 . Compared to control (3D-only) devices, the films exposed to 1 mM VBABr that undergo progressive dimensional reduction have higher fill factors (FF), open-circuit voltages ( V OC ), and overall higher PCEs. These improvements imparted by the 2D/3D interface, relative to 3D-only films, have been attributed to passivation by the RDPs and more favorable band alignment 3 , 9 , 10 , 12 . The 1 mM VBABr device also outperforms a series of devices exposed to 5 mg/mL VBABr in mixtures of IPA and CB (Fig.  5b ). From this series, we see that decreasing the proportion of IPA leads to increased
V OC
and
J SC , whereas FF remains fairly constant throughout (besides for the pure IPA solution). Fig. 5: Photovoltaic devices for different 2D/3D formation conditions. a

for forward and reverse scan
J–V
curves. Full size image The increasing
J SC
with decreasing IPA proportion can partially be attributed to lessened dissolution of the underlying 3D layer when exposed to lower concentrations of IPA, which decreases the amount of 3D perovskite that is lost during the ligand exposure and preserves thicker, more absorptive active layers. This could also contribute to the trend in
V OC . However, we posit that the improved photovoltaic metrics are also sensitive to the assembly mechanism of the 2D/3D interface, which we have shown varies with different solvent combinations: when only IPA is used, we observed no intermediate peaks during in situ GIWAXS experiments, and
n  = 1 RDPs appear to form directly (Supplementary Fig.  3 )—but when CB is included in the ligand solvent, we do observe the
n  = 2 → 1 transition (Supplementary Fig.  4 ). IPA is the solvent which dissolves both VBABr and the perovskite, whereas the CB or CF antisolvent is included to help prevent dissolution of the perovskite surface. As the transient
n  = 3 and
n  = 2 peaks are only observed when CB or CF are included in the ligand solution, this suggests that the CB and CF antisolvent serves the additional function of slowing down the cation substitution reactions—which would require IPA to solvate MA, FA, and VBABr—that are involved with the overall 2D/3D transformation. This would be consistent with the
n  = 3 → 2 → 1 transition only being observed using a solution containing 1 mM VBABr and 3:97 IPA:CF as the solvent, meaning the 2D/3D transformation proceeds slowest under these conditions, whereas films exposed to 5 mg/mL VBABr in 1:3 IPA:CB undergo faster cation substitution reactions, explaining why only the
n  = 2 → 1 transition is observed. The combined observations from our in situ GIWAXS experiments and our devices suggest that slower 2D/3D transformations are correlated with improved device performance, since the 1 mM VBABr photovoltaic has the highest
V OC , FF, and PCE. This would also be consistent with the trend of increasing
V OC
and PCE with decreasing amounts of IPA for the solvent series. If we consider the 3D-to-2D transformation as analogous to crystal growth, then slower rates of transformation or crystallization could lead to higher quality RDPs and thinner 2D layers. This may improve the optoelectronic and morphological properties of the RDPs, as has been demonstrated generally for bulk perovskite and RDP thin films used in photovoltaics and LEDs 28 , 29 , 30 . 2D/3D interface surface morphology and carrier extraction We collected atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images to examine the influence of the different solvent conditions and corresponding 2D/3D transformations on the film surface morphology (Fig.  6a, b ). For films exposed to ligands dissolved in pure IPA, we observe large (micron-sized) unoriented flakes on the surface that are not conformal with the underlying 3D grains. Decreasing the concentration of the IPA reduces the amount of large unoriented crystallites and the morphology begins to resemble that of the 3D control film. For the lowest concentration of IPA using the 3:97 IPA:CF solution, the surface is highly similar to the 3D control (with slightly lower roughness), indicating that the RDPs are formed conformally on the surface. The 1:3 IPA:CB sample has the lowest surface roughness of the solvent series using 5 mg/mL VBABr solutions, and was also the only film in this series where we could observe an
n  = 2 → 1 transition; whereas the 1 mM VBABr has an even lower surface roughness and was the only film to exhibit the
n  = 3 → 2 → 1 transitions. These observations are consistent with our hypothesis that lowering the concentration of IPA can slow down the growth of RDPs during 2D/3D interface formation: high concentrations of IPA causes rapid growth of large RDP grains that are unoriented relative to the 3D surface, whereas high concentrations of antisolvent instead facilitate conformal growth of the RDPs on the 3D grains. The slowest reaction rates may therefore yield higher quality RDPs through improved passivation and better surface conformity, which would explain the improved device performance.

PL lifetimes and fits for the same films with ( \({T}_{q}\) , quenched) and without ( \(T\) , unquenched) a Spiro-OMeTAD layer spin-coated on top of the 2D/3D interfaces. The films were photoexcited (532 nm), and emission collected, on the substrate side of the film (glass/3D perovskite interface). AFM and SEM images at different ranges and magnifications are shown in Supplementary Figs.  8
and
9 , and fitted PL lifetime parameters are shown in Supplementary Table  2 . Full size image We performed Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) to estimate the thickness of the RDP layers using depth profiles of the ligand-derived fragment C 9 H 12 N +
(Supplementary Fig.  10 ). We roughly estimate RDP layer thicknesses of 55, 40, 30, and 35 nm for IPA:CB ratios of 1:0, 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3, respectively, and 4 nm for the 1 mM solution. This is indicative of the faster RDP growth rates forming thicker layers, which is known to hinder charge extraction from 2D/3D interfaces 12 . To understand how the different 2D/3D interfaces affect charge extraction in photovoltaic devices, we performed photoluminescence (PL) lifetime quenching experiments by comparing lifetimes with and without a Spiro-OMeTAD quencher layer atop the 2D/3D interface (Fig.  6c ) 31 , 32 , 33 . Aside from the 3D film, biexponential fits were required to fit the PL lifetimes. The values shown correspond to the longer of the two fitted lifetimes, which is most relevant for evaluating the extent of diffusion to and extraction at the quencher layer. The 3D film shows the strongest quenching, and the 1 mM VBABr film is also significantly quenched (and has the longest unquenched lifetime). For the remaining films, we observe that 2D/3D interfaces formed with higher concentrations of IPA have lifetimes that are even longer in the presence of the quencher, indicative of poor extraction of holes by Spiro-OMeTAD. This is consistent with our results from photovoltaic devices, where higher IPA concentrations lead to lower fill factors. We have demonstrated using in situ GIWAXS that the formation of 2D/3D interfaces proceeds via intermediate states that differ depending on perovskite composition. For MAPbI 3 , exposure to the ligand solution induces the formation of a 2D layer of PbI 2
intercalated by solvent molecules, which is subsequently converted into
n  = 1 RDPs. For (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95
films, there is a progressive dimensional reduction from 3D fragments into
n  = 3 → 2 → 1. DFT calculations find that the binding energy at the interface between two perovskite fragments increases upon substitution with VBA molecules, owing to the ring stacking interactions afforded by these ligand cations. We use these observations to hypothesize that the ligands infiltrate and bisect the 3D perovskite to form lower-dimensional fragments that continuously split into lower- n
RDPs before becoming
n  = 1, in accordance with our observations from in situ GIWAXS experiments. By comparing photovoltaic devices with 2D/3D interfaces fabricated using different ligand solutions, we posit that lowering the concentration of IPA in the ligand solution slows the interface formation, which leads to improved photovoltaic device performance. This is supported by AFM, SEM, and ToF-SIMS measurements that reveal thicker and more disordered RDP layers are formed with higher concentrations of IPA, which leads to poorer carrier extraction from 2D/3D interfaces as determined using PL lifetime quenching. Our work highlights how a fundamental understanding of 2D/3D interface formation can inform on the design of superior devices. Future studies will be required to definitively prove these microscopic mechanisms we propose based on our experimental and computational observations. Methods Synthesis of 4-vinylbenzylammonium bromide One gram of 4-vinylbenzylamine (VBA, 0.98 mL, 7.36 mmol, stored in a freezer prior to use) was added to 15–30 mL of cold isopropanol (cooled in an ice bath). 0.65 mL of a solution of 48% HBr (6.62 mmol) was added dropwise to the cooled VBA/isopropanol mixture. This mixture was left to react for 2 h, slowly warming up to room temperature. The solvent was then evaporated under reduced pressure and the remaining white solid was left to dry for an additional 30 min under mild heating and vacuum (temperature was maintained at a maximum of 70 °C). The solid was then stirred in ~20 mL diethyl ether for 10–15 min before being filtered and washed five times with diethyl ether. This washed solid white powder was then recrystallized by dissolving in boiling isopropanol and subsequently re-precipitated with diethyl ether. The recrystallized solid was isolated via vacuum filtration, washed an additional three times with diethyl ether, and then held under vacuum for 16 h before being brought into a nitrogen glovebox for storage and use. We performed
1 H NMR on the washed and recrystallized products to ensure that the vinyl groups remained unreacted after exposure to heat when drying and recrystallizing the solid. Formation of 2D/3D perovskites on top surface For 5 mg/mL ligand solutions, 5 mg of VBABr was dissolved in 1 mL of mixtures of isopropanol and chlorobenzene. For 1 mM (~214.11 µg/mL) films, we first prepare a 10 mM stock solution in a 1:10 mixture of isopropanol and chloroform, before diluting with chloroform to achieve a VBABr concentration of 1 mM. Following the addition of chloroform, the solution will appear cloudy; adding a few drops (~20 µL) of isopropanol and vigorous shaking clarifies the solution. In all cases, the ligand solution is passed through a 0.22 µm PTFE filter before use. For devices, 200–300 µL of ligand solution is spin-coated onto annealed 3D films at a spin speed of 4000 r.p.m. for 20 s. The films are then transferred onto a hot plate to anneal at 150 °C for 30 s. This procedure follows refs.

An energy of 17.998 keV ( λ  = 0.6888 Å) was selected using a Si(111) monochromator. Patterns were collected on a SX165 CCD camera (Rayonix) placed at a distance of 157 mm from the sample. A lead beamstop was used to block the direct beam. Images were calibrated using LaB6 and processed via the Nika software package (ref.
34 ) and the GIXSGUI MATLAB plug-in (ref.
35 ). We built a sample holder with a motorized pole capable of rotating at 500–5000 r.p.m. and integrated the unit into the fully translatable and rotatable GIWAXS sample stage. This enabled us to alter the incident angle of the X-rays and the height of the spinning sample. After mounting a 3D perovskite sample, 100–200 µl of the ligand solution was drawn into tubing directly above the sample. We then began collecting GIWAXS patterns every 0.35 s (limited by detector readout time). A few frames are collected for the bare 3D perovskite before the solvent is released. After waiting ~5–7 s for the solvent to soak the surface, the motor is turned on and the sample begins to spin at 500–2000 r.p.m. (the limit of the motor). Patterns were collected for up to 30–60 s, depending on the experiment. We found that slower spin speeds were required to observe transient species discussed herein, which otherwise were not captured with our time resolution of 0.35 s. Comparing ex situ GIWAXS experiments performed over a range of 500–2000 r.p.m., we found that slower spin speeds resulted in stronger diffraction from the 2D perovskites, but otherwise qualitatively similar patterns (see Supporting Information, Supplementary Fig.  11 ). Computational details First-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) are carried out as implemented in the PWSCF Quantum-Espresso package 36 . Geometry optimization, including dispersion correction 37 , is performed using GGA-PBE 38
level of theory and the electrons-ions interactions are described by ultrasoft pseudo-potentials 39
with electrons from I 5s, 5p; Br 4s, 4p; N, C 2s, 2p; H 1s; Pb, 6s, 6p, 5d; shells explicitly included in calculations. Plane-wave basis set cutoffs for the smooth part of the wave functions and the augmented density were 40 and 320 Ry, respectively. Geometry optimizations are done with Gamma kpoint sampling for 2 × 2 supercell slabs using the experimental cell parameters of tetragonal MAPbI 3
along the periodic direction of the slabs, whereas a vacuum of more than 10 Å is introduced along the surface truncation direction. The binding energies in Fig.  4b
are calculated using the following formula: $${\rm{Binding}}\,{\rm{energy}}=[{{\rm{E}}}_{{\rm{total}}}\mbox{-}{{\rm{E}}}_{{\rm{fragment}}1}\mbox{-}{{\rm{E}}}_{{\rm{fragment}}2}]$$ where E total
represents the relaxed energy of the entire systems, whereas E fragment1
and E fragment2
represent the single-point energy of the fragments cut from the optimized models. The binding energies for Fig.  4d
are calculated using the following formula: $${\rm{Binding}}\,{\rm{energy}}=[{{\rm{E}}}_{2{\rm{D}}/3{\rm{D}}}\mbox{-}{{\rm{E}}}_{3{\rm{D}}-{\rm{fragment}}1}\mbox{-}{{\rm{E}}}_{3{\rm{D}}-{\rm{fragment}}2}\mbox{-}{{\rm{E}}}_{2{\rm{D}}-{\rm{fragment}}}]/2$$ where E 2D/3D
represents the relaxed energy of the 2D/3D systems, whereas E 3D-fragment1 , E 3D-fragment2 , and E 2D-fragment
represent the single-point energy of the fragments cut from the optimized 2D/3D slabs. Device fabrication Devices were fabricated following identical procedures as in ref.
2 . ITO glass was cleaned by sequentially washing with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol (IPA). ITO was then cleaned with ultraviolet ozone for 15 min. The substrate was then spin-coated with a thin layer of SnO 2
nanoparticle solution (1:3:3, SnO 2
(15% in water):IPA:water) at 3000 r.p.m. for 20 s, and annealed in ambient air at 150 °C for 1 h. To fabricate perovskite solar cells based on (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 , the perovskite solution was prepared by dissolving 889 mg ml −1
of FAPbI 3 , 33 mg ml −1
of MAPbBr 3 , and 33 mg ml −1
of MACl in DMF/DMSO (8:1 v/v) mixed solvent. Then, the solution was coated onto the ITO/SnO 2
substrate by two consecutive spin-coating steps, at 1000 and 2500 r.p.m. for 5 and 20 s, respectively. During the second spin-coating (2500 r.p.m.) step, 1 ml of diethyl ether was poured onto the substrate after 15 s. The intermediate phase substrate was then put on a hot plate at 150 °C for 10 min. After the fabrication of the 3D perovskite film, the 2D layer was fabricated by depositing a solution of 4-vinylbenzylammonium bromide in mixed solvent (5 mg/mL in 1:0, 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3 IPA:CB or 1 mM in 3:97 IPA:CF) onto the perovskite film, for 3–5 s, and then spinning the substrate at 4000 r.p.m. for 10 s. Then, the substrate was heat-treated at 150 °C for 30 s. For deposition of the hole-transport material, a spiro-OMeTAD solution in chlorobenzene (CB) (90.9 mg ml −1 ) was prepared, and 23 μl of lithium-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI) solution in acetonitrile (ACN) (540 mg ml −1 ) and 39 μl of pure 4- tert -butylpyridine ( t BP) were added in 1.1 ml of the solution. The spiro-OMeTAD solution including additives was spin-coated onto the perovskite surface at 1750 r.p.m. for 30 s. Finally, a gold electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation. Device testing The current density-voltage ( J–V ) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under illumination from a solar simulator (Newport, Class A) with a light intensity of 100 mW cm −2
(checked with a calibrated reference solar cell from Newport). Unless otherwise stated, the
J–V
curves were all measured in a nitrogen atmosphere with a scanning rate of 100 mV s −1
(voltage step of 20 mV and delay time of 200 ms). The active area of 0.049 cm 2
was defined by the aperture shade mask placed in front of the solar cell. A spectral mismatch factor of 1 was used for all
J–V
measurements. The chamber containing the cells for testing was purged with and maintained under nitrogen flow during the measurements. Atomic force microscopy AFM images were collected using a Cypher in tapping mode with a fast-scanning silicon tip (calibrated spring constant
k  = 10.6 N/m,
f  = 1393.303 kHz, tip model: FS-1500AuD from Asylum Research). Scanning electron microscopy imaging SEM imaging was done using a Hitachi SU 5000, Schottky Field Emission, scanning electron microscope, at 1.0 kV beam energy. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) The samples were examined using an ION-TOF (GmbH) TOF-SIMS IV equipped with a Bi cluster liquid metal ion source. A pulsed 25 keV Bi 3 +
cluster primary ion beam was used to bombard the sample surface to generate secondary ions. The negative secondary ions were extracted from the sample surface, mass separated, and detected via a reflectron-type of time-of-flight analyzer, allowing parallel detection of ion fragments having a mass/charge ratio ( m / z ) up to ~900 within each cycle (100 μs). A pulsed, low energy electron flood was used to neutralize sample charging. This technique is extremely surface sensitive, probing only the top 1–3 nm of the sample. The detection limits are believed to be in the range of ppb–ppm, depending upon the ion yield of different elements or species. Note that ToF-SIMS is not a quantitative analytical technique because ion yields for different elements are very different and dependent on the chemical environment in which the elements exist (matrix effect). In order to depth profile the five samples, a 10 keV C 60 +
ion beam was used to sputter the surface in an area of 200 µm × 200 µm, and positive ion mass spectra were collected at 128 × 128 pixels over a smaller area (128 µm × 128 µm) within the sputtered area. The depth profile data were obtained by sputtering the surface with the C 60 +
beam for 2 s followed by a 0.5-s pause before Bi 3 +
was used to analyse the newly-generated surface. The depth of the crater generated as a result of the depth profiling was measured using a mechanical stylus profilometer (KLA-Tencor P-17), which allows the calibration of depth. Photoluminescence lifetime quenching Perovskite films were deposited onto cleaned glass slides, followed by a Spiro-OMeTAD layer (both layers were coated under the same conditions as used for devices, see above). PL lifetime measurements were performed using a Horiba Fluorolog Time Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) system with photomultiplier tube detectors. A pulsed laser diode (504 nm, 110–140 ps pulse width) was used as the excitation source with a 400–1600 ns period (0.28 nJ per pulse) was used to capture accurate lifetimes carrier lifetimes. Excitation and emission collection were performed on the bottom (glass) side of the film.

Abstract Optoelectronic devices consist of heterointerfaces formed between dissimilar semiconducting materials. The relative energy-level alignment between contacting semiconductors determinately affects the heterointerface charge injection and extraction dynamics. For perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the heterointerface between the top perovskite surface and a charge-transporting material is often treated for defect passivation 1 , 2 , 3 , 4
to improve the PSC stability and performance. However, such surface treatments can also affect the heterointerface energetics 1 . Here we show that surface treatments may induce a negative work function shift (that is, more n-type), which activates halide migration to aggravate PSC instability. Therefore, despite the beneficial effects of surface passivation, this detrimental side effect limits the maximum stability improvement attainable for PSCs treated in this way. This trade-off between the beneficial and detrimental effects should guide further work on improving PSC stability via surface treatments.

Main Progress in compositional and crystal-growth engineering has made possible the fabrication of halide perovskite thin films with minimized bulk trap density, such that defects are predominantly located at the surface 5 , 6 . This has motivated the development of defect passivation treatments applied onto the top perovskite surface 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . However, such treatments can also change the heterointerface energetics and thus the charge-carrier dynamics between the perovskite and the top charge-transporting material 1 . Here we study the consequences of the altered heterointerface energetics on carrier extraction, trap passivation, charge accumulation and ion migration. We show that a negative work function change (Δ W ) accumulates charges in a potential well, which lowers the halide migration activation energy to limit the perovskite solar cell (PSC) stability. A negative Δ W
is equivalently described as a negative vacuum-level change (Δ E vac ) at a heterointerface, and hereafter, Δ W
and Δ E vac
are used interchangeably. Perovskite surface and heterointerface dynamics The genesis of this study began with our investigations on the surface energetics of perovskite films, based on a (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05
composition (where FA is formamidinium and MA is methylammonium). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements showed that ubiquitously used ammonium-iodide-based surface treatments generally result in a negative Δ W
(Fig.
1a , Supplementary Fig.
1  and Supplementary Table
1 ), which successively increases in magnitude with longer alkylammonium chain length. Given that a negative Δ W
is associated with a relatively more electron-enriched surface, we speculated initially that the negative Δ W
can be modulated by increasing the electron-withdrawing ability of the counteranion. Further UPS measurements (Fig.
1b ) showed that substitution of iodide [I] −
with bromide [Br] − , tetrafluoroborate [BF 4 ] −
or trifluoroacetate [TFA] −
progressively negated the negative Δ W
of octylammonium iodide (OAI) treatment towards that of the reference film, but only substitution with tosylate [TsO] −
fully neutralized the negative Δ W . In particular, among the counteranions, [TsO] −
has the strongest electron-withdrawing character 7 , which also justifies its ubiquitous use as the leaving group in synthetic heterolytic fission chemistry. The interaction of [TsO] −
with the surface was further verified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (Supplementary Fig.

8 , 28 ). Full size image Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurements were performed to verify the work function distributions (Fig.
1c–f ). The mean work function of the OAI-treated film decreased to 4.49 ± 0.09 eV, from 4.67 ± 0.08 eV for the reference film, and in contrast to the 4.77 ± 0.11 eV for the OATsO-treated film. From the topographical atomic force microscopy (AFM) maps, the surface morphology and root-mean-square roughness of the treated films were negligibly different (Fig.
1g ), which was expected given the dilute (but common) solution concentration used for surface treatment. Further comparisons of the height–depth distributions and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images also suggested that the surface uniformity is relatively similar for the treated films (Extended Data Figs.
1 ,
2 ). Consequences for charge-carrier dynamics Band alignments constructed from the UPS results predict that a negative Δ E vac
may create a potential well to trap charges at the heterointerface (Extended Data Fig.
3  and Supplementary Note  1 ). Cross-sectional KPFM measurements under illumination in the open-circuit (OC) condition were followed to investigate the real-time charge-carrier distributions in complete devices of planar-architecture indium tin oxide (ITO)/tin oxide (SnO 2 )/perovskite/2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[ N , N -di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD)/gold (Au) (Extended Data Fig.
4 , Supplementary Note  2  and Supplementary Figs.
3 ,
4 ). The measured device Δ E vac
values at the perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD heterointerface are consistent with those obtained from the films (Supplementary Fig.
5 ). Charge carriers are unextractable in the OC condition (split quasi Fermi level), and might accumulate at a contacting selective heterointerface of the opposite polarity 8 , 9 . This is observed as an accumulation of holes for both devices at the perovskite/SnO 2
heterointerface (Fig.
1h, i ). In contrast, a pronounced electron accumulation exists at the perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD heterointerface for only the OAI-treated device. The electron accumulation is noted to be significantly more severe than the counterpart hole accumulation. In principle, the ideal photovoltaic device would have a homogeneous electric-field distribution with no charge accumulation across its heterojunctions 10 , which is seen for the OATsO-treated device at its perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD heterointerface. Both devices were relatively field-free (that is, flat potential) along the active layer, indicative of a high-quality perovskite bulk, suggesting that the different behaviours were a consequence of the surface treatments. The results are consistent with those predicted based on the band diagrams (Extended Data Fig.
3 ), where the non-negative Δ E vac
of the OATsO-treated device avoided the potential well and charge accumulation. Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy indicated an effective suppression of charge-trapping defect states in the surface-treated films, as evidenced by their enhanced PL intensities and carrier lifetimes with a glass/perovskite architecture (Fig.
2a, b ). The defect passivation efficacies of the surface-treated films are noted to be relatively comparable. Comparing their PL intensity distributions indicates again that the surface uniformity is similar between the films (Supplementary Fig.
6 ). Despite the beneficial passivation effects, charge extraction into spiro-MeOTAD is sacrificially impeded in all surface-treated films (Fig.
2c, d  and Supplementary Table
2 ), but to different extents, with the trend correlated with the magnitude of Δ E vac . Compared with the reference/spiro-MeOTAD film, the average carrier lifetime ( τ ave ) more than doubled to 8.1 ns (from 3.0 ns) for the OAI-treated film and the steady-state PL intensity was 223% higher. In contrast, OATsO treatment simultaneously suppressed the trap states whereas charge extraction was barely impeded, avoiding the trade-off seen for the OABF 4
and the OAI treatments. Further phototransient measurements on complete devices complement the film PL results (Supplementary Fig.
7 ). We postulate that the charge obstruction and accumulation cannot be explained by the surface two-dimensional phase, as the insulating large organic cation (OA + ) is kept unchanged (Supplementary Note  3  and Supplementary Fig.
8 ). Fig. 2: Charge-carrier dynamics, performance and photostability. a ,

Full size image Device performance and hysteresis behaviour For the surface-treated devices, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) shows the trend OATsO-treated devices > OABF 4 -treated devices > OAI-treated devices, owing primarily to an increasing fill factor (FF) (Fig.
2e  and Extended Data Fig.
5 ). The device open-circuit voltages ( V OC ) are marginally different, reflective of the comparable PL results of the glass/perovskite films. The best OATsO-treated device reached a PCE of 24.41% (Extended Data Fig.
6 ). We further verified the performance of encapsulated devices at an independent third-party laboratory, noting that the performance slightly decreased after the encapsulation procedure (Extended Data Fig.
7 ). Contrasting the surface-treated devices, the PCE trend can be explained as follows (further discussion in Supplementary Note  4 ). First, a more negative Δ E vac
deepened the valence band offset with spiro-MeOTAD, which increased the hole extraction resistance to sacrifice the FF. In addition, the heterointerface barrier observed from the KPFM profiling may also contribute to impede charge extraction 9 , 11 . Regardless, a negative Δ E vac
remains the cause that gave rise to both effects. Separate investigations of a FAPbI 3
composition further verified our observations (Extended Data Fig.
8  and Supplementary Table 3). Comparing the surface-treated devices, the hysteresis behaviour generally improved as the negative Δ E vac
decreased in magnitude (Supplementary Fig.
9 ). This provided the first hint at a correlation between Δ E vac
and ion migration, given that ion migration is responsible for PSC hysteresis 12 , 13 . In contrast, the reference devices showed the lowest performance and worst hysteresis, owing to the abundant, unpassivated heterointerface traps. Overall, the device performance results provide evidence for the sacrificial trade-off of a negative Δ E vac
to limit PSC performance. Device stability under continuous illumination We assessed the photostability of encapsulated devices under continuous illumination without an ultraviolet filter. All devices were aged in an ambient atmosphere at about 40 °C. We preserved the original device architecture with spiro-MeOTAD as the hole-transporting material, without applying further modifications (for example, copper phthalocyanine (CuPC) or poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) were not used). Under maximum power point (MPP) testing (Fig.
2f ), the OATsO-treated device sustained its performance with negligible degradation after about 800 h. The OABF 4 -treated device was also relatively stable, retaining 91.5% of its performance after about 500 h. Among the surface-treated devices, the OAI-treated device degraded the most rapidly to 84.8% of its performance after about 500 h. Contrasting the device degradation under MPP testing versus OC condition testing, all devices were generally less stable under OC condition testing (Fig.
2g , Extended Data Fig.
9  and Supplementary Note  5 ). However, the device degradation trends are identical, and correlated with the magnitude of Δ E vac . In particular, the OABF 4 -treated devices with an intermediate negative Δ E vac
showed stability between that of the OAI-treated and the OATsO-treated devices. Near the approximate halfway point of 1,014 h, the devices retained 94.3% (OATsO treated), 86.2% (OABF 4
treated) and 74.8% (OAI treated) of their average PCEs. Ending after 2,092 h, the OATsO-treated devices retained 87.0% of their initial PCE on average. In contrast, the average PCE (65.1% of initial) of the OAI-treated devices decreased dramatically over the 2,092-h aging duration. The most stable OATsO-treated device (Fig.
2h ) retained 94.9% and 88.5% of its initial PCE after 1,014 h and 2,092 h, respectively. Analysing the degradation trends, we postulated that the potential well and charge accumulation may have accelerated ion migration, considering that the KPFM profiling was also performed under illumination in the OC condition. In particular, the more rapid ‘burn-in’ decay of the OAI-treated and the OABF 4 -treated devices, observed in both the MPP (Supplementary Table
4 ) and the OC tests, strongly hints that ion migration has been aggravated by a negative Δ E vac , given that transient ion migration underlies the ‘burn-in’ regime 12 , 14 , 15 . The altered ion migration energetics was also hinted by the device hysteresis behaviour. Moreover, the two-dimensional interlayer of the conventional OAI treatment probably contributed to impeding ion migration 16 , yet the OABF 4 -treated and the OATsO-treated devices still had superior photostability, indicating that the ion migration energetics have been dominantly affected. Analyses of the degraded devices To directly investigate the extent of ion migration, on completion of the OC stability testing, the original OAI-treated and OATsO-treated devices (after 2,092 h illumination) were sent for scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analysis. The encapsulation cover glasses were detached immediately before focused ion beam (FIB) milling to extract sample cross-sections. STEM bright-field images of the planar device stacks revealed that the micrometre-scale grain sizes were still visibly intact even after the extended aging (Fig.
3a, b  and Supplementary Fig.
10 ). The first notable difference between the two samples can be seen at the perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD heterointerface. The OAI-treated device had a rougher heterointerface morphology, which is in contrast to the negligibly different topography for the fresh films observed by AFM and SEM. This suggests that the roughening is inherent to the ageing process, possibly associated with heterointerface degradation by ion-migration-induced compositional loss. The elemental distributions were compared by X-ray energy-dispersive (EDX) mapping in STEM (Fig.
3c–f  and Supplementary Fig.
11 ). On close inspection, large accumulations of both bromine (green arrows) and iodine (yellow arrows) can be seen for the OAI-treated device along the top Au/platinum (Pt) region. This is verified by quantitative analysis of the elemental distributions (Fig.
3g–j ). In consideration of the nominal stoichiometry of the perovskite, both bromine and iodine accumulation were approximately similar in order magnitude (Supplementary Fig.
12 ). We note that despite progress to completely remove the need for bromine in FAPbI 3 -based compositions 17 , 18 , it has been shown that bromine might remain necessary to stabilize the α-FAPbI 3
phase in state-of-the-art devices 19 . The bulk devices that underwent FIB milling were further recovered and characterized by Bragg–Brentano XRD (Supplementary Fig.
13 ). The δ-FAPbI 3
peak supposedly at about 11.8° was not detected for both devices, and the α-FAPbI 3
phase remained dominant, ruling out possible aggravation of the perovskite phase metastability by iodine interstitial generation 20 . Fig. 3: STEM and EDX analyses of the aged devices. a ,

Full size image Aggravated ion migration and device instability We further simulated the ion migration pathways using the first-principles nudged-elastic-band methodology (Supplementary Note  6 ) 12 . To model the charge accumulation at the perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD heterointerface, we calculated the activation energy for halide migration in either a neutral uncharged or a negatively charged environment. Two independent pathways were explored: migration within a unit cell of a supercell (intra-lattice) and migration escaping a supercell (extra-lattice) (Extended Data Fig.
10  and Supplementary Table
5 ). The intra-lattice migration (vacancy mediated) investigates possible Coulombic screening effects by a charged environment to alter the bonding affinities and thus migration energetics 21 , 22 , whereas the extra-lattice migration is defect independent. For intra-lattice migration (Fig.
4a ), the energy barriers for both iodine (−38.7%) and bromine (−29.4%) decreased substantially in the negatively charged environment. Similarly observed for the extra-lattice scenario (Fig.
4b ), the activation energy for iodine migration (−13.3%) and bromine migration (−17.8%) were both lower in the charged environment. Per the Arrhenius relationship, the rate constant has exponential dependence on the activation energy barrier. Fig. 4: Physical origins of the experimental observations. a ,

Full size image Ion penetration can result in irreversible chemical reactions with spiro-MeOTAD to degrade its hole-transporting functionality 23 , and also chemical corrosion of the top electrode layer 24 , which potentially contributed to the
V OC
and FF decays of the devices. The robust encapsulation procedure ruled out environmental degradation factors, indicating that intrinsic mechanisms (that is, ion migration) were responsible, and also excluded trapped charges catalysing extrinsic degradation pathways by moisture and oxygen 25 . This is evidenced by the short-circuit current retention for the devices, demonstrating the excellent phase stability of the active layers. By excluding ion migration, half-device tests further indicate that the photostability of the surface-treated films are negligibly different (Supplementary Note  7  and Supplementary Fig.
14 ). Tying together all results, we propose that the potential well and charge accumulation created by a negative Δ E vac
aggravated device instability, by detrimentally accelerating halide migration at the spiro-MeOTAD/perovskite heterointerface. More generally, the beneficial improvements of surface treatments are sacrificially limited by a negative Δ E vac , but modulating the counteranion presents a simple method to further improve PSC stability and performance. Backtracking, we also preliminarily explored the possible mechanistic origins of Δ E vac
using first principles (full discussion in Supplementary Note  8 ), summarized as follows. Ligand-induced Δ W
originates from two independent contributions 26 , 27 : the ligand intrinsic dipole moment ( \({\mu }_{{\rm{dipole}}}\) ), and a charge-density displacement by ligand–surface interactions and bond formation ( \({\mu }_{{\rm{charge}}}\) ). The dipole moments of [OA] +
and [TsO] −
were +20.3 D and −10.5 D, respectively (Supplementary Figs.
15 ,
16 ). On the other hand, [TsO] −
induces a striking negative surface charge displacement,
\(\bar{q}\) , of −0.022 e , which is threefold larger in magnitude than the positive
\(\bar{q}\)
of [OA] +
(+0.006 e ) (Fig.
4c–e  and Supplementary Table
6 ) .
The negative
\(\bar{q}\)
sign of [TsO] −
indicates a depletion of electrons from the surface, and is equivalent to a positive Δ W . This trend is reproducible even with defect states on the surface, or different surface concentrations and species (Supplementary Figs.
17 ,
18  and Supplementary Table
7 ). Therefore, we speculate that simultaneous contributions from both
\({\mu }_{{\rm{charge}}}\)
and
\({\mu }_{{\rm{dipole}}}\)
for [TsO] −
synergistically counterbalanced [OA] + , to result in a net positive Δ E vac
for the OATsO treatment. More broadly, this proposes design principles for the ideal perovskite/charge-transporting material heterointerface. We preliminarily tested pairing [TsO] −
with alkylammoniums with different chain lengths, but OATsO treatment yielded the best performance (Supplementary Fig.
19  and Supplementary Note  9 ). Methods Perovskite film fabrication All materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, unless otherwise stated. For the (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05

MAPbBr 3
(MABr, 1-Material; PbBr 2 , Alfa Aesar Chemicals) and 33 mg ml −1
MACl (GreatCell Solar) were dissolved in a dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)/dimethylformamide (DMF) mixed solvent (1:8 v/v). The films were deposited at 4,000 rpm for 20 s. After 10 s, 0.2 ml diethyl ether was dropped on the film. The film was then annealed for 10 min at 150 °C. For the FAPbI 3
composition, 1,266 mg FAPbI 3
and 34 mg MACl were dissolved in 192.8 μl
N -methylpyrrolidone (NMP) and 1 ml DMF. The films were deposited at 4,000 rpm for 20 s. After 10 s, 0.2 ml diethyl ether was dropped on the film. The film was then annealed for 5 min at 100 °C, and subsequently 10 min at 150 °C. Subsequently, for post-fabrication surface treatment, 10 mM of the respective ammonium salts were dissolved in isopropyl alcohol, followed by deposition at 5,000 rpm for 30 s. Only OABr was dissolved in chloroform. All treatments, except with phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI), were annealed at 100 °C for 5 min. No annealing was done for PEAI. The reference films without post-treatment were washed with pure isopropyl alcohol at 5,000 rpm, followed by 100 °C annealing for 5 min. Device fabrication Substrates of ITO on glass were cleaned by successive ultrasonication in detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol, for 20 min each. Cleaned substrates were treated by ultraviolet ozone for 20 min. For the electron-transporting material, SnO 2  colloidal solution (Alfa Aesar Chemicals) was diluted in water in a 1:5 ratio. The solution was spun at 3,000 rpm for 30 s, and the film was subsequently annealed for 35 min at 165 °C. Ten-millimolar potassium hydroxide or potassium chloride in water was spun at 3,000 rpm for 30 s, and subsequently annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. We note that potassium chloride treatment was slightly improved over potassium hydroxide. The perovskite film fabrication and post-treatment procedures were performed as described above. Subsequently, 60.0 mg spiro-MeOTAD (p-OLED), 25.5 μl 4-tert-butylpyridine, 15.5 μl bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (520 mg ml −1
in acetonitrile) and 12.5 μl of FK209 (p-OLED; 375 mg ml −1
in acetonitrile) were dissolved in 0.7 ml chlorobenzene. The solution was spun at 3,000 rpm for 30 s. For the top electrode, 100-nm gold was thermally deposited at an evaporation rate of 0.5 A s −1 . The device active area is determined by a shadow mask to be 0.13 cm 2 . For the anti-reflection coating, 150-nm magnesium fluoride (MgF 2 ) was thermally deposited at an evaporation rate of 1 A s −1 . MgF 2
was deposited on all devices, unless otherwise stated. AFM and KPFM To obtain the spatial variation of the work function for each perovskite sample, we performed KPFM, which is an AFM-based technique to acquire work function information of the sample surface via measuring the contact potential difference for every pixel. For cross-sectional KPFM, the devices were cleaved simply to expose their cross-sections. A map of contact potential difference, or the relative surface potential of a sample to that of a biased AFM tip, is simultaneously obtained with a topographic image of the sample surface. The work function of the AFM tip is calibrated before and after every measurement with highly ordered pyrolytic graphite, whose work function is well known to be 4.6 eV. The real work function value of each perovskite sample is calculated from the measured surface potential of each sample, with respect to the tip work function. The temperature and humidity near the AFM were recorded before every measurement. The AFM tips used for the KPFM measurement are Au-coated NSC36/chromium–Au tips (MikroMasch) as the measurement of electric properties requires at least one conductive component. Also, each KPFM measurement involved the electrically grounded perovskite samples with conductive sample holders, through which the surface potential of any sample may have the same zero point. All AFM-based measurements were conducted with a commercial AFM NX-10 (Park Systems). STEM and EDX The STEM images and EDX maps were taken using a JEOL 2800 S/TEM equipped with dual 100-mm 2
silicon drift detectors at 200 kV with a probe size of 1 nm. To perform the STEM analyses on the devices, the device cross-section was lifted out and mounted on a copper (Cu) grid using a Tescan GAIA3 SEM/FIB microscope. The sample was protected by a 2-μm-thick Pt layer to prevent gallium implantation during the milling procedure. The sample was successively polished, first using 30 kV and 600 pA, then subsequently at 15 kV and 150 pA, and finally at 3 kV and 90 pA, until reaching electron-transparent thickness. First-principles density functional theory computation All bulk and slab first-principles calculations were performed using density functional theory (DFT) in the plane-wave/pseudopotential approach implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation (VASP) package 29 . A revised Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (PBEsol) was used for the exchange-correlation functional 30 . We included dispersion corrections to the total energy using Grimme’s DFT-D3 scheme 31 . Projector-augmented-wave (PAW) pseudopotentials were used to describe valence–core interactions 32 . Plane-wave expansions with kinetic energies up to 300 eV were chosen. Both ionic positions and supercell dimensions were allowed to relax using conjugate gradient algorithm until all residual forces were smaller than 0.02 eV–Å −1 . Bulk 4 × 4 × 4 and slab 4 × 4 × 1 Γ-centre
k -point meshes were adopted for Brillouin-zone sampling. For bulk calculations, 2 × 2 × 2 supercells were used. For surface-energy calculations, the 2 × 2 ×  L
surfaces( L
is the number of perovskite layers in the slab) were formed along (001) by periodic slabs including 9 to 11 atomic layers for a surface separated by 10–15 Å of vacuum. For the electrostatic potential maps, all structures were pre-optimized with the very tight GFN2-xTB method using the xTB program (version 6.2) 33 , 34
before conformational search. Conformational analysis of each structure was performed in water using metadynamic sampling in the extended tight binding Conformer–Rotamer Ensemble Sampling Tool (xtb CREST) program package (version 6.2) 35 . The iMTD-GC workflow was used for the conformational search algorithm with 6 kcal mol −1
energy and 0.5-Å root mean square deviation thresholds at 298.15 K. All further DFT calculations of the lowest conformers were performed using Gaussian16. Geometry optimization and frequency calculations were completed at the ωB97X-D/6-311++G(d,p) level in the gas phase. Optimized structures were verified by frequency calculations as minima (zero imaginary frequencies). Electrostatic potential charges and maps were computed with the B3LYP method, the GD3BJ 36
empirical dispersion and the LANL2DZ basis set for iodide, and the aug-cc-pvtz basis set for all other atoms based on the Hirshfeld population analysis 37 . Dipoles were calculated with the ωB97X-D/6-31+G(d) method and basis set. Electrostatic potential maps were generated using GaussView 6.0.16. Preparation of ammonium salts p-Toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate was first dehydrated to remove the water of crystallization. Using 100 ml toluene dissolves 1 g p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate in a 250-ml two-neck round-bottom flask. Vacuum distillation of toluene (about 20 mm Hg is a sufficient vacuum to lower the boiling point of toluene to a reasonable value) was followed to obtain solid p-toluenesulfonic acid using a vacuum oven at 100 °C for 1 week. For the anion substitution of alkylammonium salts, alkylamine (for example, octylamine) was added stoichiometrically to the acid (for example, p-toluenesulfonic acid) in an isopropyl alcohol mixed solvent, followed by stirring at 50 °C overnight. The chemical structure and purity of the salt was further verified by
1 H NMR (Supplementary Note  10 , Supplementary Fig.
20 ). Typically, a concentrated stock solution (>500 mM) is first prepared, followed by solution dilution to reach the final 10-mM concentration. Trifluoroacetic acid (>99.5%) was obtained from EMD Millipore. Octylammonium iodide and octylammonium bromide were purchased commercially from GreatCell Solar. Device encapsulation and stability testing Device encapsulation was carried out inside a nitrogen-filled glovebox (<0.6 ppm of O 2 /H 2 O) by using an ultraviolet-curable adhesive (Nagase America) applied to a custom-designed cover glass (AMG Korea). The glovebox was completely absent of any chemical solvents to ensure a pristine atmosphere. The devices were kept in the glovebox for at least 2 h before and after encapsulation. The cover glass was superimposed on the active layer and fixed in position with the adhesive. This was then exposed to ultraviolet illumination for 2 min to cure the adhesive and seal the cover glass to the device. Care was taken to block the device active-layer area from the ultraviolet illumination by superimposing black electrical tape on the cover glass area that corresponded to the device active-layer area. We note that in our experience, it was important to pay attention to the expiry date of the ultraviolet-curable adhesive, with fresh adhesives preferred. For the MPP stability testing, encapsulated devices were exposed to continuous illumination by a simulated air mass 1.5G spectrum illumination from a solar simulator. The devices were biased with a voltage corresponding to their MPP. The aging atmosphere was open ambient air (relative humidity (RH) 40 ± 10%). For the OC stability testing, encapsulated devices were exposed to continuous illumination by a metal halogen lamp source (90 ± 10 mW cm −2 ). The devices were placed in an in-house-built aging chamber under the OC condition. The chamber atmosphere was open ambient air (RH 40 ± 10 %). Periodically, the devices were transferred to a simulated AM 1.5G spectrum illumination from a solar simulator, also in ambient air (RH 40 ± 10 %), to measure their performance. The devices were immediately returned to the aging chamber upon measurement completion. Material and device characterization SEM was carried out using an FEI Nova NanoLab 600 DualBeam (FIB/SEM) instrument in secondary electron mode. The films were coated with an approximately 1-nm-thick Au layer by sputtering to prevent charging during the measurement. XPS measurements were carried out on an XPS AXIS Ultra DLD (Kratos Analytical). An Al Kα (1,486.6 eV) X-ray was used as the excitation source. UPS measurements were carried out using a helium discharge lamp, emitting ultraviolet energy at 21.2 eV. All UPS measurements were performed using standard procedures with a −9-V bias applied between the samples and the detectors. PL spectroscopy was performed with a Horiba Jobin Yvon system, with a 532-nm xenon lamp or a 640-nm monochromatic laser excitation source. Time-resolved PL spectra were measured using a Picoharp 300 with time-correlated single-photon counting capabilities (PLD 800B, PicoQuant) with a repetition frequency of 100 kHz. The confocal PL maps were measured using a Leica Confocal SP8-STED/FLIM/FCS confocal laser scanning microscope, using an HC PL APO oil objective (40×/1.40) and a 514-nm argon pulsed diode laser. XRD was performed by an X-ray PANalytical diffractometer at a scan rate of 4° min −1
with a Cu Kα radiation source. The simulated AM 1.5G 1-sun spectrum illumination (100 mW cm −2 ) was from an Oriel Sol3A class AAA solar simulator (Newport). The light intensity was first calibrated with an National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)-certified silicon photodiode with a KG-5 filter. A Keithley 2401 source meter was used to perform the current density–voltage device measurements. A 0.100-cm 2 -sized metal aperture was used to precisely define the device active area during measurement. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured with a custom-designed Enlitech system under a.c. mode (frequency 133 Hz) without light bias with a lock-in amplifier with a current preamplifier under a short-circuit condition. The phototransient measurements were done with a pulsed red dye laser (Rhodamine 6G, 590 nm) pumped by a nitrogen laser (LSI VSL-337ND-S) as the perturbation source. The pulse width was 4 ns at a repetition frequency of 10 Hz. The laser pulse intensity was monitored to maintain the amplitude of transient  V OC  below 5 mV. Then, the voltage under the OC condition and the current under the short-circuit condition were measured over a 1-MΩ resistor and a 50-Ω resistor, and recorded on a digital S4 oscilloscope (Tektronix DPO 4104B).

a , reference;
b , OAI-treated;
c , OATsO-treated;
d , OATFA-treated;
e , OABr-treated; and
f , OABF 4 -treated perovskite films measured by SEM. All scale bars represent 2 μm. No obvious difference can be seen between the reference and treated perovskite films. Extended Data Fig. 2 Topography of the passivated perovskite films. Representative 3D topography of the:

OATsO-treated perovskite films. Insets include the fitted statistical parameters. SD, standard deviation. Extended Data Fig. 3 Heterointerface energy band diagrams. Schematic interpretation of the heterointerface band alignments of the
a , OAI-treated and
b , OATsO-treated devices under illumination in open-circuit condition. The band alignments are constructed based on the UPS and KPFM results. CBM, conduction band minimum; VBM, valence band maximum;
\({E}_{{fn}}\) , electron quasi-fermi level;
\({E}_{{fp}}\) , hole quasi-fermi level. The dashed gray lines in
b
indicate
\({E}_{{fn}}\)
and
\({E}_{{fp}}\) of the OAI-treated device from
a . The diagrams are not drawn to scale. Both surface treatments create a type I energy alignment at the heterointerface, but the vacuum level upshift of the OATsO-treated device minimized the potential well to mitigate the electron accumulation. Extended Data Fig. 4 Device cross-sectional KPFM profiling. a , CPD profile;
b , KPFM spatial mapping;
c , corresponding AFM spatial mapping; and
d , electric field distribution of the OAI-treated device.
e , CPD profile;
f , KPFM spatial mapping;
g , corresponding AFM spatial mapping; and
h , electric field distribution of the OATsO-treated device. Measurements were performed under illumination in open-circuit condition. All scale bars represent 300 nm. The CPD offsets were adjusted such that the CPD value of the buffer layer becomes zero. Note that this does not affect the electric field and charge displacement profiles, which calculate the derivatives of the CPD profiles. Although we do not expect the rough morphology seen in
c
to affect the KPFM signal, we cannot completely rule this out at this stage. Therefore, we have repeated the KPFM measurement on another separate OAI-treated device. As shown in Supplementary Fig.
4 , we were able to reproduce the potential drop at the perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD heterointerface. Extended Data Fig. 5 Device photovoltaic parameters. Box plots showing the distribution of the:

Abstract Interface engineering through passivating agents, in the form of organic molecules, is a powerful strategy to enhance the performance of perovskite solar cells. Despite its pivotal function in the development of a rational device optimization, the actual role played by the incorporation of interfacial modifications and the interface physics therein remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the interface and device physics, quantifying charge recombination and charge losses in state-of-the-art inverted solar cells with power conversion efficiency beyond 23% - among the highest reported so far - by using multidimensional photoluminescence imaging. By doing that we extract physical parameters such as quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) and Urbach energy enabling us to assess that the main passivation mechanism affects the perovskite/PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester) interface rather than surface defects. In this work, by linking optical, electrical measurements and modelling we highlight the benefits of organic passivation, made in this case by phenylethylammonium (PEAI) based cations, in maximising all the photovoltaic figures of merit.

Introduction Inverted perovskite solar cells following a
p-i-n
structure have recently attracted enormous interest due to their enhanced stability and reduced hysteresis compared to the traditional
n-i-p
architecture 1 , 2 . However,
n-i-p
devices, where the perovskite absorber is deposited onto an electron transport layer, still result in higher power conversion efficiencies (PCE) reaching values up to 25.6% 3
mainly due to a better carrier extraction. One of the most common strategies employed to limit non-radiative losses and therefore improve perovskite solar cells (PSC)s efficiency relies on the use of interface passivation agents such as low dimensional halide perovskites 2 , 4 , 5 , organic cations 6 , 7
or self-assembled monolayers (SAM) 8 , 9 . In our recent work, we have developed an innovative strategy for the optimisation of
p-i-n
state-of-the-art inverted solar cells 10 , consisting of a dual passivation method at both the top and bottom interfaces of the perovskite active layer by introducing large organic cations at these interfaces. This resulted in improved performances with PCE beyond 23%, among the highest reported so far 10 . Specifically, two large organic A- site cations, i.e. 4-chloro-phenylethylammonium iodide (Cl-PEAI) and 4-fluoro-phenylethylammonium iodide (F-PEAI), were introduced at the interfaces of the perovskite absorber with both hole transport layer (HTL) and electron transport layer (ETL). Despite the clear improvement, questions regarding the physics behind the modified interfaces are still open 11 . Issues regarding the completeness of the coverage of the passivating layer 12 , whether a 2D perovskite is formed or not 13 , 14 , and the possible effects on carrier extraction remain not fully understood. In a more general way, several studies focused on the recombination dynamics at the perovskite/selective interfaces by tracking the photoluminescence signal and its intensity 15 , 16 , 17 . For instance, the contributions of bulk and interfacial recombination currents were decoupled through the measurements of the quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) of the individual layer by all-optical techniques 18 . Stolterfoht and co-workers used transient and absolute photoluminescence (PL) imaging to visualise non-radiative recombination pathways at modified perovskite/C 60 19
electron transport layer. Here, we combine steady-state and time-resolved multidimensional photoluminescence imaging techniques to probe the main optoelectronic and transport properties of the optimised
p-i-n
devices. First, our results demonstrate that the Cl-PEAI and F-PEAI cations deposition result in a homogenous coverage of the perovskite surface. Second, we verify that no layered perovskite is formed. Moreover, we identify that interfacial passivation is the main mechanism driving the improvement of the device open circuit voltage (V oc ), as the boost of QFLS and the reduction of surface recombination rate are observed only after PCBM (ETL) deposition. Instead, the introduction of the cations at the perovskite bottom interface (HTL/perovskite) helps in the perovskite crystallisation process but does not significantly reduce the losses at that specific device interface, as demonstrated by the quantitative analysis of the QFLS. Results Dual interfacial modified devices The devices under investigation follow a
p-i-n
structure, as shown in Fig.  1a, d . The full stack includes: glass/Indium Tin Oxide (ITO)/Poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine (PTAA)/A-cation/perovskite/A-cation/[6,6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/Bathocuproine (BCP)/silver. Ionic salts, namely piperidinium salt [BMP] + [BF 4 ] −
20 , were added to the mixed cation double halide composition (Cs 0.05 (FA 5/6 MA 1/6 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.9 Br 0.1 ) 3 ). Three different types of cells were fabricated: a reference cell (Fig.  1a ) and devices with dual interfacial modification by F-PEAI and Cl-PEAI cations (Fig.  1d ). The cations, commonly used as precursor for 2D perovskite formation, were added in very low concentrations (of 0.5 mM) at the top interface, meanwhile 20 mM were added at the bottom interface. The use of such low concentrations did not lead to the formation of a 2D Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phase 10 , as confirmed by XRD analysis reported in Supplementary Fig.  S1 , showing the characteristic perovskite reference peaks. However, as recently reported by Gharibzadeh et al 21 , 2D organic cations can be also employed to passivate both grain boundaries and interfacial defects in
p-i-n
configuration devices, allowing to achieve a substantial enhancement of the device performances. In this case the use of the top and bottom modification with the large organic cations is meant to improve the interfaces between the perovskite and the selective charge transport layers by simultaneously reducing the defect density and therefore the non-radiative recombination.

Power conversion Efficiency (PCE). Full size image The main photovoltaic characteristic parameters for the reference cell and the A-cations devices are reported in Fig.  1b, c, e and f . The addition of the cations induced an increase of all the main photovoltaic characteristics. The PCE of the devices in which both absorber interfaces were modified by A-cations is clearly enhanced, exhibiting values up to 23.34% for the Cl-PEAI and 23.22% for the F-PEAI. In particular, we can note a clear increase of the
V oc
from 1.10 V for the reference to 1.15 V using Cl-PEAI and exceeding 1.16 V using F-PEAI, which corresponds to a tenfold decrease of the dark current, i.e. of the carrier recombination rate. The current also slightly improved, in contrast with some previous observations in the literature, where the full formation of a 2D perovskite layer was acting as a blocking layer 22 . Remarkably, fill factor reached values up to 85 % on the Cl-PEAI and F-PEAI devices, within the highest ever reported for halide perovskite solar cells. Also, the devices do not show any hysteretic behaviour, as is shown in Supplementary Fig.  5 . Quantification of non-radiative losses at the interfaces To better understand the origin of this evident improvement in terms of device performances we employed multi-dimensional photoluminescence and analysed the datasets by employing physical models to quantify the key parameters governing the carrier recombination and transport. Specifically, we used two different set-ups to investigate both steady-state and transient regimes, namely a Hyperspectral Imager (HI) 23
and a Time Resolved Fluorescence Imaging (TR-FLIM) 24
set-up. Photoluminescence (PL) spectrum images were acquired by using a blue laser (405 nm) and illuminating the samples from the thin films side to avoid optical artefacts induced by the glass. We acquired a series of PL calibrated maps of neat perovskite thin films deposited on glass, half devices (glass/ITO/PTAA/perovskite) and full devices without the silver top electrode (glass/ITO/PTAA/perovskite/PCBM/BCP) of reference and Cl-PEAI or F-PEAI samples. Notably, the A-cations samples do not exhibit any 2D perovskite emission peak, as shown in Supplementary Fig.  3 . The lack of a 2D perovskite formation is thus further confirmed, corroborating the XRD measurements. The spatially averaged and absolutely calibrated values of each map were fitted by using a model based on Planck’s law 25 , 26
(see Fig.  2a
for PL spectra and fits of full devices), allowing to determine the QFLS values for each set of samples, reported in Fig.  2b
and in Table  1 . In Table  1
we also report the radiative quasi–Fermi level splitting ( Δµ rad ) and the radiative open circuit voltage ( V oc rad ). The
Δµ rad
is defined as: $${\triangle {\mu }}^{{{{{{\rm{rad}}}}}}}={kT}\cdot {{{{{\rm{ln}}}}}}\left(\tfrac{{I}_{{{{{{\rm{ph}}}}}}}}{{q\phi }_{{{{{{\rm{em}}}}}}}}\right)$$
(1)
where
I ph
is the photocurrent due to the considered illumination and
kT
the thermal energy of the charge carriers and
q
is the elementary charge. The term
\({\phi }_{{{{{{{\mathrm{em}}}}}}}}\)
is the PL emission of the absorber in thermal equilibrium with its surrounding at 300 K. It means that only the thermal photons emitted in the dark by the surrounding excite the device, which in return emits the very minimum PL photons flux possible. This PL flux depends on the bang gap energy, the temperature and the absorption coefficient, which is affected by the defect density.

(3)
with EQE being the external quantum efficiency of the full devices. We considered the radiative QFLS ( Δµ rad ) as the radiative limit for the optical measurements and the
V oc rad
as the upper limit for the open-circuit voltage measured by electrical characterisation. The small difference of the values determined for the two limits arises from the fact that the
V oc rad
depends not only from optical properties of the absorber and the radiative recombination but also from the collection and the injection of carriers. We obtained values of QFLS for neat perovskite thin films equal to 1.24 eV for the reference sample and 1.25 eV for the two A-cations samples, corresponding to 80–90 meV losses if compared to the radiative QFLS ( Δµ rad ) that is equal to 1.33 eV in all cases. Interestingly, the main impact of the organic cation passivation is observed for full devices. In this case, the difference between reference and A-cations containing samples is in the range of 60–70 meV, proving that the cations have drastically reduced the non-radiative recombination at the interface absorber/ETL. Conversely, when considering neat perovskite or half devices the addition of the cations resulted in an improvement of only 10–20 meV. Therefore, the main passivation mechanism acting relates to the interfacial passivation at the interface absorber/ ETL. The introduction of the organic cations at the interface HTL/absorber favoured the perovskite crystallisation on the PTAA surface, but did not drastically reduce the losses at that interface. It is worth noting that the interface perovskite/PCBM appears to be particularly critical for device optimisation. The fast recombination observed at this specific interface represents a major loss mechanism for solar cell operation 29 . Moreover, we linked the QFLS of full devices to the
V oc
measured on full devices 30
by finding a good agreement between the two values, thus confirming the direct relationship between optical and electrical measurements. A similar approach to evaluate the recombination processes of 3D-2D interfaces in a
n-i-p
architecture was performed by Sutanto et al. 22 , where the interfacial passivation was considered as the main process affecting the losses. However, cation interfacial passivation, not only reduce the non-radiative recombination, but also favour the carrier extraction that, on the contrary, is limited in the case of full 2D perovskite formation at the interfaces, acting as a barrier for the photo-generated carriers 22 . Finally, we determine the total losses due to non-radiative recombination in full devices by comparing the radiative voltage radiative voltage
V oc
rad
with the measured
V oc
(ΔV=
V oc rad
− V oc ). In the reference sample Δ V ref
is equal to 0.21 eV, while in the A-cations devices ΔV corresponds to 0.16 eV in the case of Cl-PEAI and to 0.15 eV in the case of F-PEAI, thus confirming the beneficial role played by the addition of the cations on the charge losses. To gain further insights regarding the carrier dynamics, we performed TR-FLIM analysis on two sets of samples: (i) thin films on glass and (ii) full cell devices (without the Ag metallic layer to allow for illumination from both sides). For both sets of samples, we analysed a reference sample with only bulk perovskite as well as Cl-PEAI and F-PEAI samples. The experiments were performed using a wide field illumination via a pulsed 532 nm laser with repetition rate of 40 kHz. For each sample, the fluence of the laser was varied from low (~10 11  ph.cm −2 ) to high level (~1.5 × 10 12  ph.cm −2 ) and all the samples were measured with both top and bottom illumination (and light collection). A complete list of the available data and conditions is reported in the Supplementary Information. Decays averaged over the image for low fluence (~10 11  ph.cm −2 ) by illuminating the samples from the thin films side are presented in Fig.  2c
(neat perovskite) and
2d
(full devices). In the case of bare absorbers, the three decays are very similar, whereas for the full devices, the samples with the added A-cation layers show slower decay than the reference. We estimate that the slightly higher PL level obtained for the Cl-PEAI bare absorbers is not discriminating enough to conclude that this cation has a better passivation effect than its F-PEAI counterpart. Slower decays of multilayer samples do not necessarily imply better devices as passivation layers could hinder the amplitude of the current of charges flowing out of the cell. In this case, considering also that the short-circuit currents slightly increased upon modification with the A-cations (see Fig.  1c ), we can conclude that this passivation approach allows to reduce non-radiative recombination at the perovskite-charge transport layer interfaces while allowing for high currents to flow. Transient measurements thus confirmed that the passivation plays a key role only at the perovskite-charge transport layer interface, as also observed in the steady-state study. Importantly, the time-resolved analysis also proves that high non-radiative recombination is responsible for the fast decay of the reference cell of Fig.  2d , that therefore cannot be attributed to carrier extraction as sometimes reported in the literature 31 , 32 . Next, we treated the datasets by using drift-diffusion model in order to quantify the induced passivation. However, fitting decays of multilayer samples remains challenging, as an incorrect modelling of the layer stack, of the band alignment or of the boundary conditions can easily lead to data misinterpretation 16 , 33 . To overcome this issue, we chose to fit the simplest model possible, that is based on a thin film without the neighbouring extracting layers. Supplementary Figure  10
represents the fitting results of the cells’ decays, the green dotted line is the fitted model, while the coloured curves correspond to the experimental data. We fit a unique drift-diffusion model to represent simultaneously four curves, i.e. decays acquired in bottom and top configuration at low and high fluence. The fitted parameters are the top and bottom surface recombination velocities – all the other parameters are fixed, see Supplementary Materials for more details. We consider the bulk non-radiative recombination to be negligible as compared to surface recombination and assign all non-radiative recombination to the surfaces. The fitting results for bottom surface recombination velocity on full devices are presented in Fig.  2d . We observe a drastic reduction of the recombination velocities at the top surface ( S top ) for the two passivation strategies. In particular, S top
was reduced by a factor varying from nine to five going from ~900 cm/s for the reference to ~110 cm/s and ~200 cm/s for the Cl-PEAI and F-PEAI samples respectively, as shown in Table  2 . For unpassivated classical semiconductors, surface recombination velocities are of the order of 10 5 –10 6  cm/s 34 , 35 , 36 , while passivated surfaces may reach low values in the range of 10–10 2  cm/s 34 , 37 , 38 . For perovskite films, even unpassivated, we 39 , 40
and others 34 , 41
have found surface recombination velocities of the order of 10 3  cm/s which are fully compatible with our present analysis. Again, the TR-FLIM results are consistent with those obtained via the hyperspectral studies, showing that the passivation mainly takes place at the perovskite/ETL interface. Table 2 Top and bottom fitted interface recombination velocity for reference and A-cations full cells. Full size table Quantitative optical microscopy analysis It is noteworthy that the passivation of the top surface is achieved by incorporating the A-cations into the antisolvent used for triggering the perovskite layer crystallisation, thus raising the question regarding the homogeneity of passivation obtained by this method. In order to better assess the homogeneity of the passivation over the samples surface, we mapped the optoelectronic properties by spectrally and temporally resolved photoluminescence imaging analysis on the full stack without the silver rear electrode. We first fitted the PL spectra pixel-by-pixel 39 , 42
by using the model proposed by Katahara and Hillhouse 43 , 44
to extract key physical parameters like the bandgap energy ( E g ), the quasi-Fermi levels splitting (Δμ or QFLS) and the Urbach energy ( E u ) from absolutely calibrated spectral images. More details on the fitting model are provided in the Supplementary Information section. The maps of the QFLS are shown in Fig.  3a–c . All the samples, reference and most importantly cation modified samples, show a good homogeneity with a standard deviation in the order of 0.006 eV. Moreover, no areas with values of QFLS comparable to pure 3D cells, i.e. in the range of 1.110 ± 0.013 eV, can be observed on the Cl-PEAI and F-PEAI samples, proving the uniformity of the passivation effect induced by the cations. The introduction of the large cations has thus produced a clear reduction of non-radiative losses and importantly we demonstrate that the passivating agents act uniformly on the whole surface of the solar cell. However, in the three cases, small spatial fluctuations in the order of few meV in the 10 µm range are distinguishable. These minor inhomogeneities may be due to the spin-coating process. In Fig.  3d–f
we investigate the variations of the
E u
which again exhibits a good homogeneity. The determined values are in line with
E u
values reported in the literature and measured by different characterisation methods 45 . Fig. 3: Continuous wave photoluminescence imaging analysis. Hyperspectral measurements on the stack glass/ITO/PTAA/perovskite/BCP/PCBM. quasi-Fermi level splitting (Δµ) maps for

E g
and QFLS and between
E u
and QFLS measured at each pixel, as shown in Fig.  3g, h . All the physical parameters, namely
E g , QFLS and
E u , have a small statistical dispersion. The introduction of the A-cations results in a minimal increase of the gap of the material in the order of few meV but significantly impacts the QFLS that shows a substantial raise of its average value from 1.11 eV up to 1.18 eV. A very small variation of
E u
of ~1 meV is observed when comparing the reference to the A-cations passivated devices. Moreover, this analysis suggests that the addition of the cations does not significantly affect the bulk recombination kinetics of the absorber as QFLS (in the case of bare absorbers),
E g
and the
E u , do not vary significantly after the A-cations addition. Finally, we wanted to further confirm the homogeneity of the A-cation deposition as well as their role in the interface physics. To do so, we used TR-FLIM acquisitions to map the local decay times, often called “lifetime”, for the three full stacks (glass/ITO/PTAA/perovskite/BCP/PCBM), as shown in Fig.  4a–d . In general, the definition of “lifetime” is ambiguous, as it does not represent an intrinsic property of the material (e.g. it is dependent on the excitation conditions), and does not always correlate well with the electrical figures of merit, such as the open circuit voltage 15 . For these reasons we employ here the term decay time. If we place ourselves in the correct setting - after the carrier distribution has homogenised in depth and with low radiative recombination - the decay time of PL is a measure of the non-radiative recombination. In the case of triple cation mixed halide perovskite thin films this corresponds to a few tens to one hundred nanoseconds after the laser pulse 46 . We use then the decay times to map the non-radiative recombination in our devices. To get a high signal to noise ratio for the images we used the high fluence (1.5 × 10 12  ph.cm −2 ) acquisitions, as reported in Fig.  4a–d . Here the decay time is defined as the inverse slope of the logarithm of the local decay fitted between 90 ns and 500 ns after the laser pulse, see SI for more details. Figure  4a–c
are thus representative of the non-radiative recombination in the devices. Overall, an excellent homogeneity was achieved at the 1 mm 2
scale for the F-PEAI and Cl-PEAI samples. The histograms of Fig.  4d
display that the difference between reference and modified samples in terms of non-radiative recombination is statistically significant. The mean decay time on the maps extracted from the high fluence acquisitions are found to be 84.6 ns for the reference, 107.9 ns for the F-PEAI and 117.35 ns for Cl-PEAI. The images of the passivated layers show a slightly wider distribution of decay time, compared to the reference sample with a standard deviation of 6.7 ns for the reference and 8.7 ns and 8.2 ns for the F-PEAI and Cl-PEAI, respectively. This analysis provides us with an approximate estimate for the uncertainty and noise level on the images. The decay time maps thus show the homogeneity of the interfacial cation addition treatment resulting in a uniform improvement of decay times for the A-cation modified devices, further confirming the reduction of non-radiative recombination.

Full size image Moreover, we provide the decay times for the full stacks when the carrier density of the transient experiment is ~10 15  cm −3 , which is the order of magnitude of carrier density expected at 1 sun continuous illumination condition for perovskite devices close to the radiative limit 47 . To obtain these values of decay time, we used a procedure described in the SI for the low fluence (10 11  ph.cm −2 ) acquisitions that yields decay times of 102 ns (±7%) for the reference cell, 254 ns ±(3%) for the Cl-PEAI cell and 261 ns (±3%) for the F-PEAI cell. For the low fluence dataset, the local signal to noise ratio of the maps is too low for the local determination of the decay time and therefore we do not show maps for this illumination condition. Discussion In conclusion, we have investigated the interface recombination dynamics related to an emergent passivation approach in the field of perovskite solar cells based on the introduction of large cations at the absorber interfaces by coupling electrical and optoelectronic characterisation methods and modelling. In particular, we demonstrated that the introduction of large organic cations such as Cl-PEAI and F-PEAI resulted in a drastic reduction of interfacial recombination processes leading to PCE up to 23.34%, one of the highest ever reported for a
p-i-n
architecture. Importantly, we proved that this passivation approach does not significantly act on the surface defects of the absorber layer but drastically reduce the non-radiative recombination at the interface perovskite/PCBM. Indeed, the major improvement in terms of QFLS was observed after the deposition of the ETL, with an increment from 1.11 eV to 1.18 eV for passivated devices. Conversely, in the case of neat perovskite thin films the QFLS remained almost constant after the two cations deposition. The same behaviour was also observed for transient measurements that showed identical decays in the three cases. Finally, photoluminescence maps and decay times maps of full devices proved that the cations were uniformly deposited over the perovskite surface at the micrometre scale and that the main bulk optoelectronic properties of the absorber such as the energy gap and the Urbach energy were homogenous at a local level. This work provides insights into the processes occurring at the interfaces of highly efficient perovskite solar cells, which are fundamental for further progress in the field and makes this passivation method extremely promising to approach the theoretical limit of perovskite devices. Methods Materials Unless otherwise stated, all materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Alfa Aesar and used as received. Perovskite films and devices were fabricated using PbI 2
and PbBr 2
(99.99% purity) purchased from TCI, organic halide salts purchased from GreatCell Solar and Cesium Iodide (99.99% purity) purchased from Alfa Aesar. The poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The PC61BM was purchase from Solenne. The bathocuproine (BCP; sublimed grade, 99.99% purity). All the anhydrous solvents were purchased from Acros Organics. Perovskite film preparation and device fabrication Pre-patterned ITO/glass substrates were sequentially cleaned with acetone and isopropanol by ultrasonication for 15 min. The ITO/glass substrates were then dried with N2 and treated with oxygen plasma at 100 mW for 10 min. The HTL and the perovskite films were fabricated in a drybox (relative humidity <2 %), while the ETL and the contacts were deposited inside a glovebox filled with inert atmosphere N 2 . For reference devices, a hole transport layer of
∼ 10 nm thickness made of PTAA with a concentration of 1.5 mg ml −1
dissolved in toluene was spin-coated at a speed of 2000 rpm for 40 s and then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. After the annealing step, the samples were washed by DMF by spin-coating it on the prepared PTAA films at 4000 rpm for 30 s. The perovskite precursor solution (1.2 M) composed of mixed cations (Pb, Cs, FA and MA) and halides (I and Br) was dissolved in mixed solvent (DMF/DMSO = 4/1) according to a formula of Cs 0.05 (FA 5/6 MA 1/6 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.9 Br 0.1 ) 3
with an excess of PbI 2
of 1%. The piperidinium salt [BMP] + [BF4] − was dissolve in the perovskite solution obtained with the molar ratio 0.25 mol %. The perovskite is deposited via a two-step spin-coating procedure with 1000 r.p.m. for 12 s and 5000 r.p.m. for 27 s was adopted for the preparation of perovskite films. A mixture of antisolvents (CB/IPA = 9/1, 150 μl) was dripped on the spinning substrate during the 21 s of the second spin-coating step. Subsequently, the sample was annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. The electron transport layers were dynamically deposited from a PC61BM solution (20 mg/mL in CB) and spin-coated onto the perovskite layer at the speed of 2000 rpm for 30 s (with a ramping speed of 1000 rpm/s) and annealed for 10 min at 100 °C. Next, thin layers of BCP (0.5 mg/mL in IPA) were spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s (with a ramping rate of 1000 rpm/s) as hole blocking layers. The devices with an area of 4.5 mm 2
were completed by thermally evaporating of Ag (80 nm). The devices with modified interfaces were prepared by dissolving a small amount of the A-cations in DMF (20 mM) used for washing the PTAA and in the mixture CB/IPA (0.5 mM) used in the antisolvent step. Photovoltaic device characterisation Current density-voltage measurements were performed in ambient conditions under simulated AM 1.5 light with an intensity of 100 mW cm −2
(Abet Sun 3000 Class AAA Solar Simulator). The intensity was calibrated using a Si reference cell (NIST traceable, VLSI), and corrected by measuring the spectral mismatch between the solar spectrum, reference cell, and the spectral response of the PV device. The mismatch factor obtained was approximately 1.1. Cells were scanned using a Keithley 2450 source measure unit from 1.2 to 0 V and back, with a step size of 0.025 V and a dwell time of 0.1 s, after light soaking for 2 s at 1.2 V. The pixel area was 3 mm × 1.5 mm. XRD XRD patterns were measured in ambient air using a Bruker D2 Phaser diffractometer equipped with a Cu-Anode ( λ  =  1.54060 Å) and a LYNX-EYE detector in 1D mode. All scans (coupled 2θ/θ, 2 θ  = 10°–45°, step size 0.02°) were background corrected using the Bruker Diffrac.Eva software. Hyperspectral characterisation The hyperspectral imaging system records a luminescence intensity signal along three dimensions {x,y,λ}. The set-up is composed by a home-built microscope with Thorlabs optomechanical elements, a 2D bandpass filtering system from company Photon Etc with 2 nm resolution, and a 1Mpix silicon-based CCD camera PCO1300. The sample was illuminated ( λ  = 405 nm) through an infinity-corrected ×50 Nikon objective with numerical aperture of 0.6, and the luminescence is collected through the same objective. The excitation beam and luminescence signals are separated with appropriate Thorlabs dichroic beam splitter (DMLP 495) and filters (FESH 450, FELH 450). The 2D luminescence signal is corrected for each pixel of the sensor from the spectral transmissions along all the optical path, from the read noise and dark current noise of the camera. The incident photon flux measured was 100 mW/cm 2 , corresponding to 1 sun equivalent photon flux. We obtained this photon flux by dividing the measured power of the LED used for the illumination under the objective over the LED spot size at the working distance of the objective. All the acquisitions were performed in nitrogen atmosphere. Post-treatment of the data cubes includes a deconvolution and fit to the generalised Planck law, which are realised with a dedicated Matlab routine employing the Levenberg−Marquardt algorithm. TR-FLIM characterisation The TR-FLIM setup records luminescence intensity over an imaging sensor and as a function of time. We used a Princeton Instrument PiMAX4 gated camera. We used 3 ns wide temporal gates that we slid in time to record the local decays of the films. The illumination was performed with a Coherent Laser ( λ  = 532 nm, pulse width 15 ps), defocused and homogenised by a rotating diffuser to obtain a flat and homogenous wide field excitation. The repetition rate of the laser was set to 40 kHz.To estimate the fluences, the wide field illumination was imaged with a portable CCD array to obtain the illumination area while the incident power was also measured. A ×10 objective was used both for excitation and collection, and the laser was filtered out with a DMLP650R beam splitter as well as with a FEL0680 filter. Each acquisition was repeated two times in a row to check for any reproducibility issue (none was found) and to obtain a better average signal to noise ratio.

Abstract
Defect passivation has developed as an attractive approach to promote the performance of perovskite solar cells. However, robust control of the interplay between the defects and adsorbates is challenging and critical for applications. Here, hydrophobic 3-(trifluoromethyl) phenethylamine hydroiodide (CF 3 PEAI) is introduced on the surface of perovskite films. By controlling the post-treatment of the passivation layers, the amphipathic passivation agent CF 3 PEAI can form 2D perovskite and go deeply into the films (>30 nm), which can further passivate the internal defects and improve the long-term stability of perovskite films. Furthermore, the CF 3 PEAI 2D passivated perovskite films exhibit better energy level alignment, lower surface roughness, longer carrier lifetimes, lower trap state density, and higher stability than the control and the ones without annealing. Our first-principles simulation reveals that CF 3 PEAI effectively renormalizes the defective states of the vacancies with benign characteristics. The defect–adsorbate complex facilitates the manipulation of versatile electronic states for a prolonged lifetime of photoexcited carriers with improved structural integrity. Perovskite solar cells' performance is enhanced from 18.87% to 21.05% along with improved stability, which can retain 98% of initial performance after 528 h in ambient air with a humidity of 70–80%.

Abstract
Stabilization of the crystal phase of inorganic/organic lead halide perovskites is critical for their high performance optoelectronic devices. However, due to the highly ionic nature of perovskite crystals, even phase stabilized polycrystalline perovskites can undergo undesirable phase transitions when exposed to a destabilizing environment. While various surface passivating agents have been developed to improve the device performance of perovskite solar cells, conventional deposition methods using a protic polar solvent, mainly isopropyl alcohol (IPA), results in a destabilization of the underlying perovskite layer and an undesirable degradation of device properties. We demonstrate the hidden role of IPA in surface treatments and develop a strategy in which the passivating agent is deposited without destabilizing the high quality perovskite underlayer. This strategy maximizes and stabilizes device performance by suppressing the formation of the perovskite δ-phase and amorphous phase during surface treatment, which is observed using conventional methods. Our strategy also effectively passivates surface and grain boundary defects, minimizing non-radiative recombination sites, and preventing carrier quenching at the perovskite interface. This results in an open-circuit-voltage loss of only ∼340 mV, a champion device with a power conversion efficiency of 23.4% from a reverse current–voltage scan, a device with a record certified stabilized PCE of 22.6%, and enhanced operational stability. In addition, our perovskite solar cell exhibits an electroluminescence external quantum efficiency up to 8.9%.

Abstract The energy landscape of reduced-dimensional perovskites (RDPs) can be tailored by adjusting their layer width ( n ). Recently, two/three-dimensional (2D/3D) heterostructures containing
n  = 1 and 2 RDPs have produced perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with >25% power conversion efficiency (PCE). Unfortunately, this method does not translate to inverted PSCs due to electron blocking at the 2D/3D interface. Here we report a method to increase the layer width of RDPs in 2D/3D heterostructures to address this problem. We discover that bulkier organics form 2D heterostructures more slowly, resulting in wider RDPs; and that small modifications to ligand design induce preferential growth of
n  ≥ 3 RDPs. Leveraging these insights, we developed efficient inverted PSCs (with a certified quasi-steady-state PCE of 23.91%). Unencapsulated devices operate at room temperature and around 50% relative humidity for over 1,000 h without loss of PCE; and, when subjected to ISOS-L3 accelerated ageing, encapsulated devices retain 92% of initial PCE after 500 h.

Main Reduced-dimensional perovskites are perovskite quantum well (QW) layers confined between large organic ligands. The number of stacked lead (Pb) octahedra between the organic spacers determines the width of the RDP layer:
n  = 1, 2, 3 and so on (Fig.
1a ). Changing the RDP layer width ( n ) within bulk RDP films alters the energy landscape of the resulting material, hence narrow RDP films ( n  ≤ 5) produce excellent light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and luminescent solar concentrators 1 , 2 . Although films containing wider RDPs ( n  ≥ 10) have been used to produce highly stable PSCs, these devices suffer from an inferior performance due to poor carrier mobility 3 , 4 . More recently, record-performing PSCs have used a 2D/3D heterostructure, fabricated via spin coating RDP (or 2D) ligands onto the surface of a 3D perovskite 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 . A comparison of PSC efficiency/stability from recent reports is shown in Supplementary Fig.
1
and demonstrates that all of the most efficient devices reported have used this structure. Studies have revealed that this heterostructure consists of a thin layer of
n  = 1 and/or
n  = 2 RDPs atop a bulk 3D perovskite 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , which increases performance via passivation and increased electron blocking 17 , 18 . Electron blocking is beneficial for devices built in the negative–intrinsic–positive (NIP) architecture, in which the 2D-treated perovskite surface is coated with a hole transport layer (HTL); however, when used in the generally more stable 19 , 20 , 21 , 22
inverted (that is, positive–intrinsic–negative, or PIN) structure, this strategy achieves mixed results. Chen et al. found that a 2D treatment applied to inverted cells improved the open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) but reduced the fill factor (FF) 23 , and Bai et al. found that introducing a small amount of 2D ligand into the antisolvent improved the device performance, opening the door to further study of the width of RDPs and indeed their presence 24 . On the other hand, Park et al., La-Placa et al. and Zhao et al. all found that using a 2D layer in a PIN device reduced the PCE due to a lower current and fill factor 25 , 26 , 27 . We speculated that reducing the confinement in the 2D layer could reduce electron blocking and produce inverted PSCs with an exceptional performance.

1b ) and compared them with the bulk 3D perovskite Cs 0.05 MA 0.1 FA 0.85 PbI 3
(MA, methylammonium; FA, formamidinium). Consistent with earlier reports, we found little dependence between the valence band maximum (VBM) and
n
(RDP width) 18 , 28 , 29 . Instead, quantum confinement upshifts the conduction band minimum (CBM), which induces electron blocking in the devices. We confirmed this detrimental effect by comparing NIP and PIN PSCs treated using standard 2D treatments (Supplementary Text
1 ). Encouragingly, simulations using the solar cell simulation tool SCAPS-1D 30
suggested that, due to their deeper CBM, a capping layer of
n  ≥ 3 RDPs would be beneficial for PIN solar cell performance via surface passivation with reduced resistance to carrier transport (Supplementary Text
2 ). In bulk RDP films, the average layer thickness is modulated by changing the ratio of the 2D ligands to the 3D perovskite precursors in solution 1 , 4 . We explored several options to reproduce this for a 2D post-treatment (Supplementary Text
3 ). Our most distinctive results came from introducing a small amount of dimethylformamide (DMF) (at 1:200 by volume in isopropanol (IPA)) and methylammonium iodide (MAI) (1:2 by weight) to the 2D ligands in solution. We posit that MAI is needed to reduce the ratio of the 2D ligand to the A-site cation and that DMF introduces Pb directly from the 3D perovskite surface (Supplementary Fig.
9 ). Using this strategy, we were able to produce 2D perovskite capping layers containing
n  ≥ 3 RDP layers (Fig.
1e ). For convenience, we henceforth refer to our altered 2D ligand treatment as a quasi-2D treatment. Notably, Zhou et al. demonstrated that adding MAI and DMF to a phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) surface treatment improves the performance of PIN solar cells 31 . This earlier study is limited in scope, however, discussing only the effect of DMF on the penetration depth of the 2D treatment. Using time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry, we estimated the penetration depth of phenethylammonium (PEA) from solutions using different DMF concentrations (Supplementary Fig.
11 ) and found no correlation in our sample size (from 1:200 to 1:50 DMF:IPA by volume). We instead expect that the origin of improved performance is the production of wider RDPs at the interface between the 3D perovskite and the electron transporting layer (ETL). Considering this new observation, we sought a treatment that would optimize this effect. Characterizing the quantum well width in 2D/3D heterojunctions A strong dependence between QW width and bandgap exists in 2D perovskites 32 , 33 . Hence, ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy is able to accurately identify the distribution of different 2D species in perovskite films 34 , 35 , 36 . We first acquired the TA spectra of 2D- and quasi-2D-treated films using the most common 2D perovskite ligands: butylammonium (BTA) (Fig.
2a,d ) and PEA (Fig.
2b,e ). Although the majority absorption from each film is from the 3D perovskite (780 nm, Supplementary Fig.
12 ), each film displays bleach peaks in the 500–700 nm range, characteristic of RDPs. Similar to spectra acquired by Niu et al., the standard 2D-treated films display bleach signals from
n  = 1 and/or 2 RDPs 36 . Quasi-2D-treated films, however, contain
n  ≥ 3 RDPs, with the PEA treatment producing more
n  ≥ 3 RDPs than BTA. Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) confirmed that these 2D layers lie horizontal to the substrate (Supplementary Fig.
13 ), as in other reports 5 , 13 , 15 . Recently, it was documented that bulk quasi-2D perovskite films made using fluorinated PEA ligands form different QW structures compared to unfluorinated PEA 35 . To this end, we tested PEA-based ligands with a fluorine at each node (Fig.
1c ) and found that this has a dramatic effect on the QW distribution (Supplementary Fig.
16 ). Mostly notably, we found that using our quasi-2D surface strategy, 3-fluoro-phenethylammonium (3F-PEA) produces a 2D/3D heterojunction containing majority
n  = 3 RDP (Fig.
2f ). The structures of all 2D ligands mentioned are shown in Fig.
1c . Fig. 2: Comparison of 2D and quasi-2D treatments using different 2D ligands. a – c , TA spectra of films treated with BTA ( a ), PEA ( b ) and 3F-PEA ( c ) using the standard 2D treatment.
d – f , TA spectra of films treated with BTA ( d ), PEA ( e ) and 3F-PEA ( f ) using the quasi-2D treatment. The majority absorption in each case is from the 3D perovskite (780 nm) but this has been excluded for clarity. Absorption peaks are assigned in order, and a comparison with single-cation quasi-2D films is shown in Supplementary Table
4 . The inset bar in

g – h , Absorption maps from in situ TA spectroscopy obtained during spin coating. Cs 0.05 MA 0.1 FA 0.85 PbI 3
3D perovskite films were spun at 1,500 r.p.m. and a constant 1 ps pump–probe delay time was used. The quasi-2D treatments for BTA ( g ), PEA ( h ) and 3F-PEA ( i ) were all dropped at 7.2 s. Source data Full size image To better understand why different ligands produce different RDP distributions, we the measured TA spectra in situ while spin coating quasi-2D treatments (Fig.
2g–i ). With a pump–probe delay of 1 ps and a time resolution of 0.3 s, we spun films at 1,500 revolutions per minute (r.p.m.) and deposited the 2D treatment dynamically. A reduction in the 3D perovskite absorption is apparent ~2.4 s after solution deposition for all samples. For the BTA treatment, this reduction in 3D bleach is concurrent with the arrival of a strong
n  = 2 bleach. For the PEA-based treatments, the 2D signal does not appear until ~1.2 s after the 3D bleach reduction. It has been suggested that bulkier organics intercalate more slowly, which induces them to form wider RDPs 34 . Our results agree, indicating that π–π stacking ligands form wider RDPs due to slower crystallization, which suppresses narrower RDP formation. This is corroborated by films treated using hexylammonium (HA) and octylammonium (OTA) ligands, which demonstrate an increased presence of
n  ≥ 3 RDP with increasing ligand length (Supplementary Fig.
14 ). To investigate the effect of increased π–π stacking, we treated samples with 1-naphthylmethylammonium (Fig.
1c ) but found that the quasi-2D treatment substantially reduced the RDP absorption in the TA spectra (Supplementary Fig.
15 ). We also gained insight into why 3F-PEA forms wider RDPs. Standard PEA produces
n  = 2 and 3 simultaneously, whereas 3F-PEA forms
n  = 3 one frame (0.3 s) before the appearance of
n  = 2, suggesting that
n  = 3 is preferentially formed from the precursor complex. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to compute the formation energy of
n  = 1, 2, 3 and 4 RDPs for each ligand (details in Supplementary Text
5 ). As previously reported 4 , the formation energy of the
n  = 1 RDP was found to be the lowest for all ligands; however, this was not supported by our experimental findings or results from other studies 36 , 37 . Nonetheless, considering that forming single layers of lead iodide (PbI 2 ) is considerably more energy intensive than larger slabs (Fig.
3a ) it seems reasonable that
n  = 1 layers are less likely to form, especially when excess cations are available as within the quasi-2D treatment. Hence, we compared the formation energy of
n  ≥ 2 RDPs. Generally, we found that formation energy increases with increasing width, however, we also found that bonding different ligands onto 2D perovskite flakes (FA n −1 Pb n I 3 n −1 ) introduces different types of strain into the system which is released through different distortions of the perovskite (Supplementary Fig.
22 ). The specific orientation and arrangement of the ligands caused by the fluorine atom in 3F-PEA (structure taken from 35 ) introduces larger strain compared to PEA or BTA, manifesting as larger distortions, and therefore larger perovskite flakes are need to fully release the additional strain. As a result, a sweet spot for
n  = 3 is found in the formation energy of 3F-PEA (Fig.
3b ), which results in the preferential formation of
n  = 3 revealed in the TA data. We calculated the formation energies for each of the ligands
1 – 7
in Fig.
1c
(Supplementary Fig.
21 , Supplementary Text
5 ), but only 3F-PEA possessed a preference for
n  ≥ 3. Fig. 3: Formation of quasi-2D perovskite capping layers from density functional theory. a , The PBE+TS calculated formation energy of perovskite flakes ((FA) n −1 Pb n I 3 n −1 , see inset). The formation energy of FAPbI 3
is shown as a dashed line. Note that the energy required to form a single-layer (PbI 2 ) flake ( n  = 1 RDP) is much higher than for other layer widths. PBE+TS, Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional with the Tkatchenko–Scheffler dispersion correction.
b , The formation energy of different RDPs dependent on the layer width

and the ligand (BTA, PEA and 3F-PEA). The same calculations were performed on HA, OTA, 2F-PEA and 4F-PEA and can be found in Supplementary Fig.
21 . Source data Full size image Band alignment of 2D/3D heterostructures We proposed to modulate the
n
distribution of 2D/3D heterojunctions with the aim of reducing the electron barrier at the perovskite/ETL interface. To verify this, we used surface-sensitive inverse photoelectron spectroscopy (IPES), which directly measures the conduction band of the first few nanometres of film 29 , 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 . Following work from Endres et al. 42
we used gaussian fittings to extract the CBM and found that, as expected, the CBM values of 2D-treated surfaces are upshifted compared with the controls (Fig.
4a–c ). Using the quasi-2D treatment the 2D/3D CBM offset is reduced substantially for PEA- and 3F-PEA-treated films relative to their
n  = 1 (and/or 2) analogues (0.42–0.14 eV and 0.49–0.08 eV, respectively) but less so for BTA (0.41–0.31 eV). We measured the potential of our film surfaces using Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and found a similar trend (Supplementary Fig.
17 ). This complements the results in the previous section which suggest that the quasi-2D treatment using BTA produces fewer
n  ≥ 3 RDPs than PEA or 3F-PEA. We also performed surface-sensitive UPS on control, 2D- and quasi-2D-treated films (Supplementary Fig.
18 ) to produce the schematics in Fig.
4e,f . Similar to the plot in Fig.
1b
and several previous reports 18 , 28 , 29 , altering the RDP width has little effect on the VBM, and reducing confinement simply shifts the conduction band deeper, closer to the 3D perovskite. More details on these UPS and IPES measurements can be found in Supplementary Text

IPES measurements were taken using a bandpass filter of 254 nm (4.88 eV) for the control and PEA-treated films and 280 nm (4.42 eV) for BTA- and 3F-PEA-treated films.

Source data Full size image Carrier extraction and photovoltaic performance To explore the device implications, we investigated the charge transport in BTA-, PEA- and 3F-PEA-treated films using the 2D and quasi-2D treatments. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) increases after the standard 2D treatment for each ligand (Supplementary Table
6 ), suggesting a reduced density of non-radiative recombination centres 8 . This effect is enhanced slightly by the quasi-2D treatment, indicating improved passivation. A similar trend is visible in transient photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy results (Fig.
5a
and Supplementary Fig.
24 ), where longer lifetimes are recorded for 2D- and quasi-2D-treated films (a summary of lifetimes is found in Supplementary Table
3 ). The modestly improved passivation of the quasi-2D treatment may be due to the addition of MAI, which has also been reported to passivate perovskite surfaces 43 . Fig. 5: Carrier extraction and performance of quasi-2D-treated PSCs. a , Transient PL from bare films treated with 3F-PEA.

The asterisk indicates the point at which the MPP tracking was paused for 12 h. Source data Full size image Following the work of Kirchartz et al., we deposited [6,6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) atop the perovskite as an ETL and used the quenched
τ 1
lifetimes to compare charge extraction (Fig.
5b ) 44 . The quenched
τ 1
lifetime of the control film was 4.6 ns. After deposition of 3F-PEA this doubled to 9.2 ns, suggesting that the standard 2D treatment impedes the flow of electrons from the perovskite to the ETL. Using the quasi-2D treatment this was reduced to 4.9 ns, implying a considerably improved extraction compared with the standard 2D treatment. A similar trend is seen using BTA and PEA (Supplementary Fig.
24 ). For quantitative values we repeated these observations using power-dependent TA (Supplementary Text
6
and Supplementary Table
8 ) and space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements. From the TA data we found that both 2D and quasi-2D treatments reduced the surface recombination velocity (from ~600 cm s −1
to ~300 cm s −1 ). The SCLC measurements show a similar trend (Supplementary Fig.
27 ) but the overall effect is less obvious as we are examining the entire film and not simply the interfaces. In PSCs using bulk RDPs, films that contain mixed-dimensional phases have reduced mobility due to charge trapping in the higher
n
species 3 . To understand why this is not necessarily the case in 2D/3D heterostructure films, we used TA spectroscopy to measure the charge dynamics. Using a 450 nm pump at a low power (5 µJ cm −2 ) to avoid Auger recombination 45 , we excited the 2D and 3D layers of 2D- and quasi-2D-treated films. Measuring the
n  = 2 bleach decay (~570 nm) using monoexponential fits, we calculated the carrier funnelling rates for both treatments; a summary of the results is shown in Supplementary Fig.
28 . For a standard 2D-treated film, there are no peaks present for
n  > 2 (Fig.
2a ), thus we expect the charges to funnel directly from
n  = 2 to the 3D perovskite 1 , 46 , for which we observed a 28.6 ps decay time. When we generate a favourable pathway for electrons by adding a layer of PCBM, we observed a faster decay (7.5 ps). Repeating these measurements with a quasi-2D-treated film, we observed a decay without PCBM of 5.8 ps, suggesting that the charges are funnelled to the now present
n  > 2 species 1 , 46 . However, adding a layer of PCBM resulted in an even faster decay (1.2 ps), indicating that charge trapping does not play a limiting role in charge extraction. To gauge the effect of the 2D and quasi-2D treatments in full device stacks, we conducted transient photovoltage (Supplementary Fig.
25 ) and transient photocurrent measurements (Fig.
5c ). Following ref.
47 , devices were biased with the same white-light intensity to reach near- V OC
conditions and were photoexcited with low-power laser pulses to generate small photovoltage perturbations (Δ V , kept to lower than 20 mV). Monoexponential fits were used to estimate the carrier lifetime under
V OC
and short-circuit current density ( J SC ) conditions. We observed a slower decay in photovoltage for the quasi-2D-treated films compared with the standard 2D treatment (Supplementary Fig.
25 ), which is consistent with the TRPL results and indicates a reduction in trap states in the absorber. More importantly, we observed a faster decay in the photocurrent for the quasi-2D-treated films ( τ quasi-2D  = 0.82 µs compared with
τ 2D  = 1.28 µs for 3F-PEA-treated films), which suggests a substantial improvement in carrier extraction 48 . In addition, we performed conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) on these films, revealing increased conductivity in quasi-2D-treated films (Supplementary Figs.
31
and
32 ). We fabricated devices with an ITO/NiO x
nanoparticles/perovskite/PCBM/BCP/Ag structure using different surface treatments (BTA, PEA, 2F-PEA, 4F-PEA and 3F-PEA; standard 2D and quasi-2D treatments) for statistical analysis (Supplementary Figs.
33 – 36 ). In agreement with our finding that increased
n  ≥ 3 RDPs result in more efficient charge extraction, 3F-PEA outperformed the PEA- and BTA-treated devices. Improved performance of the quasi-2D-treated over the standard 2D-treated devices is derived mainly from FF and
J SC
improvements; a typical set of current density–voltage ( J – V ) curves are shown in Fig.
5d
along with their figures of merit. To check the reproducibility, we provide statistics for devices fabricated over a one-year period (September 2020 until September 2021) in Supplementary Figs.
37 – 39 . To confirm that improved passivation alone was not the cause of the increased FF, we simulated the effect of reducing only the surface trap density using the SCAPS-1D simulation tool (Supplementary Fig.
40 ) and found that a 20 mV difference in
V OC
would correspond to an increase in FF of approximately 0.5% rather than the 2.2% increase manifested. A quasi-2D-treated device was certified at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The C 60 /BCP-based device produced a quasi-steady-state certified PCE for inverted PSCs of 23.91% (with FF = 83.46,
J SC  = 24.90 mA cm −2
and
V OC  = 1.15 V; Supplementary Fig.
43 ). A voltage loss of 0.38 V is the lowest documented for a NiO x -based PSC (bandgap from the external quantum efficiency, Supplementary Fig.
42 ) 49 . We focused on improving the performance of the NiO x -HTL inverted PSCs because they have shown high stability at elevated temperatures 19 , 49 , 50 . However, 2D treatments have been shown to be unstable above 50 °C, degrading in a matter of hours 51 ; thus it was crucial to ascertain whether or not any new 2D treatment could withstand high temperatures. We prepared 2D- and quasi-2D-treated films and heated them at 65 °C for 20 h, periodically measuring their characteristics via TA spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig.
41 ). We found that the
n
distribution of both treatments was robust under heating, suggesting that the quasi-2D treatment could be used to produce extremely stable devices. We evaluated the stability of the devices under accelerated-ageing conditions according to International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS) protocols 52 . We tracked the maximum power point (MPP) of two quasi-2D-treated devices under illumination at ~50% relative humidity. An unencapsulated device was monitored at room temperature for 1,000 h (ISOS-L-1I) and an encapsulated device on a temperature-controllable stage was monitored at 65 °C for 500 h (ISOS-L-3), and the results are shown in Fig.
5e,f , respectively. The unencapsulated room-temperature devices showed no degradation after 1,000 h of MPP tracking (4.9% increase in PCE), whereas the device baked at 65 °C lost around 8% of its maximum PCE after 500 h. On the basis of a linear extrapolation from these data, we estimate the
T 80
lifetime of this device (that is, the time required to drop to 80% of the initial efficiency) to be 1,190 h (Supplementary Fig.
45 ) 20 , 52 . After 500 h the MPP tracking for the heated device was paused but the cell remained under illumination at 65 °C, and after 12 h the MPP tracking was resumed. The PCE of the device recovered to 99% of the initial PCE, which is an encouraging indicator of its real-world long-term stability 53 . We note that the device structure was not altered for stability testing and the initial efficiency of both devices was >23% (Supplementary Fig.
44 ). Therefore, we report an ISOS-L-3 accelerated-ageing test that corresponds directly to high-efficiency PSCs (>20% PCE). Conclusion We presented a simple technique that alters the QW widths in 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures. This was tailored to improve inverted PSCs, and was accomplished by reducing the confinement within the 2D capping layer to reduce the electron barrier between the 3D and 2D perovskite species. This resulted in highly stable NiO x -based PSCs with certified efficiency values, and could be useful in other metal halide-based optoelectronics devices in which well-passivated, negative–intrinsic contacts are desirable. Methods Materials All the materials were used as received without purification. Commercial indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates (20 Ω per square) with dimensions of 25 × 25 mm were purchased from TFD. PbI 2
and bathocuproine (BCP) were purchased from TCI. Caesium iodide (CsI) (99.999%) and fullerene (C 60 ) (99.5%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. PEAI, FAI (formamidinium iodide) and MAI were purchased from GreatCell Solar. 2F-PEAI (2-fluoro-phenethylammonium iodide), 3F-PEAI, 4F-PEAI (4-fluoro-phenethylammonium iodide) and 1-naphthylmethylammonium iodide were purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology. PCBM was purchased from Nano-C. All the solvents used in the process were anhydrous and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Nickel oxide nanoparticle synthesis The NiO x
nanoparticles were prepared via the hydrolysis of nickel nitrate following previous work 54 , 55 . Briefly, Ni(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O (20 mmol) was dissolved in deionized water (20 ml) to obtain a dark-green solution. Then, NaOH aqueous solution (4 ml, 10 mol l −1 ) was slowly added to the dark-green solution with stirring. After being stirred for 20 min, the colloidal precipitate was washed thoroughly using deionized water three times and dried at 80 °C for 6 h. The obtained green powder was then calcined at 270 °C for 2 h to obtain a black powder. The NiO x
nanoparticle ink was prepared by dispersing the obtained NiO x
nanoparticles in a mixed solution of deionized water and IPA (3:1, v/v) for a concentration of 10 mg ml −1 . Solar cell fabrication ITO glass was cleaned through sequential washing with detergent, deionized water, acetone and IPA. Before use, the ITO was cleaned with ultraviolet ozone for 20 min. For the inverted solar cells, the substrate was spin-coated with a thin layer of NiO x
nanoparticle film using the NiO x
nanoparticle ink at 2,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. The perovskite absorber layers were deposited inside a nitrogen-filled glovebox with a controlled water and oxygen level of less than 1 ppm. The temperature inside was monitored to be 25–30 °C. The precursors for the Cs 0.05 FA 0.85 MA 0.1 PbI 3
perovskites were prepared by dissolving the PbI 2 , MAI, CsI and FAI in a mixed solvent (4:1 in volume) of DMF and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), respectively. This was done by adding the powders to a vial (20 ml size) and then adding the mixed solvent (1 ml) before leaving the vial on a stirring hotplate set to 60 °C for 30 min; all steps were undertaken in a glovebox. For fabrication of the perovskite film, the substrate was spun at 2,000 r.p.m. for 30 s with an initial acceleration of 1,000 r.p.m., and then at 6000 r.p.m. for 10 s with an acceleration of 6000 r.p.m. per second. In the second step, anisole (150 μl) was added dropwise onto the substrate during the last 5 s of spinning. The substrate was immediately placed on a hotplate and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. For the surface treatment, the 2D solutions were prepared by dissolving the 2D ligand salts (that is, PEAI, BTAI, 3F-PEAI, HAI and OTAI) with or without MAI and DMF in IPA. The ligand salt (1 mg ml −1 ), MAI (0.5 mg ml −1 ) and an IPA:DMF v/v ratio of 1:200 was used, unless stated otherwise. The 2D layer was fabricated by depositing the 2D ligand solution (150 µl) onto the perovskite film surface, and immediately after deposition the film was spun at a rate of 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s with a 4,000 r.p.m. per second acceleration. The film was then annealed at 100 °C for 5 min. For the ETL, either C 60 /ALD-SnO 2
or PCBM/BCP were used. C 60
was formed via evaporation, and deposition of the ALD-SnO 2
(atomic-layer-deposited tin(IV) oxide) was carried out using a PICOSUN R-200 Advanced ALD system. Water and tetrakis(dimethylamino)tin(IV) (TDMASn) were used as the oxygen and tin precursors, respectively. The precursor and substrate temperature was set to 75 °C and 85 °C, respectively. Nitrogen gas (90 sccm) was used as carrier gas. Pulse and purge times for water were 1 s and 5 s, respectively, and 1.6 s and 5 s, respectively, for TDMASn. The total deposition cycle is 134 s, corresponding to 20 nm of SnO 2 . PCBM was formed by spin coating the PCBM solution (20 mg ml −1
in chlorobenzene) at 1,000 r.p.m. for 30 s and then annealing at 100 °C for 5 min. Then a thin and uniform BCP layer was deposited via drop‐casting 2–3 drops of BCP dissolved in IPA while spinning the substrate at 5,000 r.p.m. Finally, a 120-nm-thick silver contact was deposited on top of the BCP using thermal evaporation under high vacuum (<5 × 10 −7  torr) using an Angstrom Engineering deposition system to produce a cell with an active area of 0.053 cm 2 . For non-inverted solar cells, the substrate was spin-coated with a thin layer of SnO 2
nanoparticle solution (1:3:3, SnO 2
(15% in water):IPA:water) at 3,000 r.p.m. for 20 s and annealed in ambient air at 150 °C for 1 h. The perovskite solution was prepared by dissolving FAPbI 3
(889 mg ml −1 ), MAPbBr 3
(33 mg ml −1 ) and MACl (33 mg ml −1 ) in DMF/DMSO (8:1 v/v) mixed solvent. Then, the solution was coated onto the ITO/SnO 2
substrate through two consecutive spin-coating steps, at 1,000 r.p.m. for 5 s and 2,500 r.p.m. for 20 s. During the second spin-coating (2,500 r.p.m.) step, diethyl ether (1 ml) was poured onto the substrate after 15 s. The intermediate phase substrate was then put on a hotplate at 150 °C for 10 min. After the fabrication of the 3D perovskite film, the 2D layer was fabricated by depositing a solution (5 mg ml −1 ) of PEAI in IPA onto the perovskite film and then spinning the substrate at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. Then, the substrate was heat-treated at 100 °C for 5 min. For deposition of the hole transport material, a spiro-OMeTAD solution in chlorobenzene (90.9 mg mL −1 ) was prepared, and lithium-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide solution in acetonitrile (23 μl, 540 mg mL −1 ) and pure 4- tert -butylpyridine (39 μl) were added to an aliquot of the solution (1.1 ml). The spiro-OMeTAD solution including additives was spin-coated onto the perovskite surface at 1,750 r.p.m. for 30 s. Finally, a gold electrode was deposited via thermal evaporation to produce a cell with an active area of 0.053 cm 2 . Reduced-dimensional film fabrication Reduced-dimensional (PEA) 2 (MA/FA/Cs) n −1 Pb n I 3 n +1
perovskite solutions were prepared by dissolving the appropriate stoichiometric quantities of PbI 2 , MAI (or FAI or CsI) with PEAI in DMF/DMSO (4:1 v/v). The resulting solution was filtered using a polytetrafluoroethylene syringe filter (0.2 μm) before deposition. Then, the solution was coated onto the glass substrate through two consecutive spin-coating steps, at 1,000 r.p.m. for 5 s and 2,500 r.p.m. for 20 s. During the second spin-coating (2,500 r.p.m.) step, diethyl ether (1 ml) was poured onto the substrate after 15 s. The intermediate phase substrate was then put on a hotplate at 150 °C for 10 min. Device testing The current density–voltage ( J – V ) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under illumination from a solar simulator (Class A, Newport) with a light intensity of 100 mW cm −2
(checked using a calibrated reference solar cell from Newport). The
J – V
curves were measured in a nitrogen atmosphere with a scanning rate of 100 mV s −1
(a voltage step of 10 mV and a delay time of 200 ms). The active area was determined by the aperture shade mask (0.049 cm 2
for small-area devices) placed in front of the solar cell. A spectral mismatch factor of unity was used for all
J – V
measurements. For stabilized output measurements at the MPP, the device testing chamber was left under ambient conditions. Solar cells were fixed at the MPP voltage, (determined from
J – V
sweeps in both scanning directions) and the current output was tracked over time. Stability testing Devices were placed in a homemade stability-tracking station. The illumination source is a white-light LED with its intensity calibrated to match 1-Sun conditions. For room-temperature tests (ISOS-L-1I), the device chamber was sealed and supplied with continuous nitrogen purging. For the ISOS-L-3 ageing test, the device chamber was left open in a room with 50 ± 10% relative humidity, and the solar cell was mounted on a metal plate kept at 65 °C using a heating element. A thermal couple attached to the metal plate was used to monitor and provide feedback control to the heating element to ensure temperature consistency. The MPP was tracked using a perturb-and-observe algorithm that updates the MPP value every 10 s. Encapsulation was done by capping the device with a glass slide, using UV-adhesive (LT-U001, Lumtec) as the sealant. X-ray diffraction X-ray diffraction patterns were collected using a Rigaku D/Max-2500 diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα1 radiation ( λ  = 1.54056 Å). Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering GIWAXS measurements were conducted at the BL14B1 beamline of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility using X-rays with a wavelength of
λ  = 1.24 Å at a grazing incidence angle of 0.3° and an exposure time of 80 s. The GIXRD patterns were collected using a MarCCD 225 detector with a sample–detector distance of 280 mm and were presented in
q
coordinates using the equation
q  = 4πsin θ /λ, where
θ
is half of the diffraction angle. In the present GIXRD data,
q
has been calibrated by measuring the X-ray diffraction from a lanthanum hexaboride reference sample. Images were calibrated using lanthanum hexaboride and processed using the
Nika
software package 56
and the
GIXSGUI
MATLAB plug-in 57 . Simulations Simulations of PSCs were conducted using the heterojunction solar cell simulator SCAPS-1D, version 3.3.07 30 . Full simulation details can be found in Supplementary Text
2 . Conductive atomic force microscopy Scanning probe microscopy experiments were carried out under ambient conditions using an Asylum Research Cypher S AFM instrument with low-force-constant (k = 2.8 N m −1 ), Ti/Ir-coated, silicon cantilevers (ASYELEC.01-R2). Contact-mode AFM was used to simultaneously produce surface and current maps applying a fixed bias voltage of −0.6 V. Measurements were obtained under top illumination from a 3 W white LED. Transient absorption spectroscopy Femtosecond laser pulses of 1,030 nm generated using a Yb:KGW laser at a 5 kHz repetition rate (Pharos, Light Conversion) were passed through an optical parametric amplifier (Orpheus, Light Conversion) to select 450 nm light. This served as the pump pulse, whereas the probe pulse was generated by focusing the initial 1,030 nm pulse into a sapphire crystal, which resulted in a white-light continuum (Helios, Ultrafast). With a temporal resolution of the system of
∼ 350 fs, each time step meant delaying the probe pulse with respect to the pump, with time steps that increased exponentially. Every other pump pulse was blocked using a chopper to determine the change in optical density. After going through a grating spectrograph, the pulses were measured using a charge-coupled device (CCD) (Helios, Ultrafast). Spinning in situ TA spectroscopy was performed using a purpose-built spinner, designed such that the incident probe light could pass through the spinning substrate and be directed into the CCD. The pump–probe delay was set to 1 ps. The time resolution of the system was 0.3 s. The measurements were taken in an ambient atmosphere with 35% relative humidity. Photoluminescence quantum yield measurements The excitation source was an unfocused beam from a 442 nm continuous-wave diode laser. Photoluminescence was collected using an integrating sphere with a pre-calibrated fibre coupled to a spectrometer (QE Pro, Ocean Optics) with an intensity of ~100 mW cm −2 . PLQY values were calculated using
\({\mathrm{PLQY}} = \frac{{P_{\mathrm{S}}}}{{P_{{\mathrm{ex}}} \times A}}\) , where
\(A = 1 - P_{\mathrm {L}}/P_{\mathrm {Ex}}\) ,
P S
is the integrated photon count of the sample emission on laser excitation,
P ex
is the integrated photon count of the excitation laser when the sample is removed from the integrating sphere and
P L
is the integrated photon count of excitation laser when sample is mounted in the integrating sphere and hit by the beam. Space-charge-limited current measurements SCLC measurements were obtained using electron-only (ITO/SnO x /perovskite/PCBM/Ag) devices and hole-only (ITO/NiO x /perovskite/poly(triaryl amine)/Au) devices separately. A Keithly 2400 source meter was used to measure the relevant
J – V
curves. We calculated the trap density ( n t ) by SCLC measurement in the hole-only and electron-only devices. The trap-state density
n t
can be calculated using the following relation: $$n_{\mathrm{t}} = \frac{{V_{{\mathrm{TFL}}}\varepsilon \varepsilon _0}}{{eL^2}}$$ where
e
is the elementary charge,
L
is the perovskite film thickness (~650 nm),
ε 0
is the vacuum permittivity,
ε
is the relative dielectric constant and
V TFL
is the onset voltage of trap-filled limit region. Transient photoluminescence spectroscopy TRPL measurements were carried out using a Horiba Fluorolog time-correlated single photon counting system with photomultiplier tube detectors. A pulsed laser diode (634 nm, 110–140 ps pulse width) was used as the excitation source for steady-state and transient measurements. For transient measurements, a 7,200 ns period for unquenched films and an 800 ns period for quenched films (0.28 nJ per pulse) was used to capture accurate carrier lifetimes. Inverse photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy For combined UPS and IPES measurements, an Excitech H Lyman-α photon source (10.2 eV) with an oxygen-filled beam path was used for excitation, coupled with a PHI 5600 ultrahigh vacuum system with a hemispherical electron energy analyser. A sample bias of –5 V and a pass energy of 5.85 eV were used for UPS acquisition. IPES measurements were performed in the Bremsstrahlung isochromat mode with electron kinetic energies below 5 eV and an emission current of 2 μA to minimize sample damage. A Kimball Physics ELG-2 electron gun with a barium oxide cathode was used to generate the electron beam; the emitted photons were collected using a bandpass photon detector that included an optical bandpass filter (280 nm for 3F-PEA- and BTA-treated films, and 254 nm for the control and PEA-treated films) and a photomultiplier tube (R585, Hamamatsu Photonics). Samples were held at a −20 V bias during all IPES measurements and the ultrahigh vacuum chamber was blacked-out to exclude external light. Perovskite films sent for combined UPS/IPES were fabricated on ITO/NiO x
substrates. UPS measurements of quasi-2D perovskite films were carried out using a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250XL instrument; a −10 V bias was applied for UPS measurements. Transient photovoltage/photocurrent measurements These measurements were carried out according to ref.
47 . Kelvin probe force microscopy KPFM was conducted using an MFP-3D AFM (Asylum Research, Oxford Instruments) with conductive Ti/Ir-coated tips (ASYELEC.01-R2 probe,
f  = 71.72 kHz,
k  = 2.8 N m −1 ). The tips were calibrated using Sader’s method 58 , 59 . The KPFM measurement was implemented using a two-path method at a scan rate of 0.5 Hz, where the first pass in every scan line was used to determine the topography and the following second pass was used to measure the contact potential difference between the tip and the sample. The second pass was scanned by raising the tip at a fixed 20 nm height above the sample following the topography. Each set of samples was arranged in proximity on a common substrate and were measured using the same tip and scanning parameters. We also adopted different scanning sequences of the samples in each set to ensure that the obtained potential trend is reliable and the global drift (if any) is not dominating. The two sets of samples (PEA- and 3F-PEA-treated) were measured using different probes, thus a shift in the overall potential is observed.

Abstract
The thermal stability and decomposition products of formamidinium, a widely used organic cation in perovskite solar cell formulation, were investigated. The thermal degradation experiments of formamidinium-based perovskites and their halide precursors were carried out under helium atmosphere and vacuum at a constant heating rate of 20 °C min −1 . In addition, pulsed heating steps were employed under illumination/dark conditions to simulate a more realistic working temperature condition for photovoltaic devices. The identification of gas decomposition products was based on the quadrupole mass spectrometry technique. The released amounts of
sym -triazine, formamidine, and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) were observed to highly depend on the temperature. For the experimental conditions used in this study,
sym -triazine was obtained as the thermal product of degradation at temperatures above 95 °C. Below this temperature, only formamidine and HCN generation routes were observed. The energy pathways of formamidinium thermal degradation under photovoltaic working temperature conditions were further assessed by density functional theory calculations. The results indicated that formamidinium was more resilient to thermal degradation and the release of irreversible decomposition products compared to methylammonium because of a larger enthalpy and activation energy obtained for the decomposition reactions. The HCN instantaneous concentration observed during the low temperature heating tests and the estimations of the maximum release of HCN achievable per meter-square of an FA based perovskite based solar cell were compared to acute exposure guideline levels of airborne HCN concentration.

Abstract The interest of the scientific community on methylammonium lead halide perovskites (MAPbX 3 , X = Cl, Br, I) for hybrid organic-inorganic solar cells has grown exponentially since the first report in 2009. This fact is clearly justified by the very high efficiencies attainable (reaching 20% in lab scale devices) at a fraction of the cost of conventional photovoltaics. However, many problems must be solved before a market introduction of these devices can be envisaged. Perhaps the most important to be addressed is the lack of information regarding the thermal and thermodynamic stability of the materials towards decomposition, which are intrinsic properties of them and which can seriously limit or even exclude their use in real devices. In this work we present and discuss the results we obtained using non-ambient X-ray diffraction, Knudsen effusion-mass spectrometry (KEMS) and Knudsen effusion mass loss (KEML) techniques on MAPbCl 3 , MAPbBr 3
and MAPbI 3 . The measurements demonstrate that all the materials decompose to the corresponding solid lead (II) halide and gaseous methylamine and hydrogen halide and the decomposition is well detectable even at moderate temperatures (~60 °C). Our results suggest that these materials may be problematic for long term operation of solar devices.

Introduction In 2009, the pioneering work published by Kojima
et al. 1
regarding the use of methylammonium lead halide perovskites as sensitizers in solar cells, though obtaining quite modest results in comparison to then established dye-sensitized solar cells-DSSCs (solar conversion efficiencies obtained: 3.13% and 3.89%, with MAPbBr 3
and MAPbI 3 , respectively vs. 11.2% for the best performing DSSC that year 2 ), sparked an enormous and well motivated interest of the scientific community about this new class of sensitizers. In fact, the optimization of the device led to a very quick performance improvement of the same and hybrid cells based on MAPbX 3
sensitizers soon outperformed their DSSC counterpart. In fact, as of 2015, the best performing perovskite cells attained solar conversion efficiency of 20.1% 3
vs 13% of the best DSSC 4 . But this stunning development is accompanied by many problems 5 , 6 , 7
the most important being related to hysteresis of cells and stability issues of MAPbX 3
compounds with regards to interaction with atmospheric agents (especially moisture) 7
and to their thermal and thermodynamic stability towards decomposition, especially in severe operating conditions such as under intense solar irradiation. Despite the extreme importance of information regarding the last two issues, i.e. thermal and thermodynamic stability towards decomposition of the materials for the technological development of solar devices based on MAPbX 3
compounds, the available literature does give only very limited experimental information 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 . Here we present the results of two parallel investigations on MAPbCl 3 , MAPbBr 3
and MAPbI 3 . The first is a study of the thermal stability of the compounds by means of non-ambient X-ray diffraction. The second is a study of the thermodynamics of decomposition of the compounds by Knudsen effusion-mass spectrometry (KEMS) and Knudsen effusion mass loss (KEML) techniques. By the combination of these two studies, we clarify for the first time the decomposition reactions and we obtain both kinetic data useful for the estimation of the lifetime of the devices in operative conditions as well as thermodynamic data necessary to assess the stability of the compounds in diverse conditions, such those encountered during the realization of the devices and during their operation. Thermal Stability: Non-Ambient X-ray Diffraction Conventional powder X-ray diffraction has been used to check the phase purity of the synthesized compounds. The diffractograms of MAPbCl 3 , MAPbBr 3
and MAPbI 3
are presented in
Fig. 1
and all of them show only the reflections of the desired compounds 12 , 13 , with no lead (II) halides detected. Figure 1 X-ray diffraction patterns of the synthesized MAPbX 3
compounds. All the diffraction patterns show only the reflections of the perovskite phases, with no lead (II) halides detectable. Full size image The compounds were then inserted into the non-ambient reactor chamber and underwent a thermal treatment under helium atmosphere from 130 °C to 170 °C with isotherms every 10 °C, each one lasting 10 hours. After each isotherm the sample was quickly cooled to 25 °C and a diffraction pattern was taken. The temperature range was chosen in order to have detectable changes of the samples within the isotherm duration. The thermal profile used in the experiments is shown in
Figure S1 of the Supplementary Information . The diffraction patterns after each isotherm for each compound are given in
Fig. 2 , while a magnification of the same, together with the reflections of the corresponding MAPbX 3
and PbX 2
are shown in
Figures S2–S4 of the Supplementary Information . The phase identification analysis performed on the patterns revealed that the only solid decomposition product is the corresponding lead (II) halide for all the compounds under investigation. No trace of solid methylammonium halides has been found. This fact, together with the results coming from the Knudsen effusion-mass spectrometry (KEMS) and Knudsen effusion mass loss experiments (KEML), demonstrate that the decomposition reactions occur in all cases with the loss of gaseous methylamine (MA) and the corresponding hydrogen halide HX according to the reaction: Figure 2 X-ray diffraction patterns of the MAPbX 3
compounds after each isotherm in the non-ambient reactor chamber. The temperature of the isotherm after which the pattern was taken, as well relative weight percentages of the phases are reported inside each sub-panel. The symbols “+” and “#” are used as guide to the eye to appreciate two characteristic reflections (one for each phase) and their relative variation after each thermal treatment. Full size image and not by phase separation of solid lead (II) halides and methylammonium halides, a possibility that had to be taken into account considering that all the methylammonium halides under consideration have melting points over 200 °C. After phase identification, the quantitative phase analysis was performed by applying the Rietveld method on the diffractograms. The relative weight percentages of the crystalline phases are reported in the diffraction patterns shown in
Fig. 2 . The order of reaction for the decomposition reactions has been determined by differential thermal analysis (DTA) of the compounds using the “shape index” of the endothermic decomposition peak in the thermograms 14 . The DTA peaks for decomposition of the compounds are shown in
Fig. 3 . For MAPbBr 3
and MAPbI 3
the peaks due to the melting processes of the corresponding lead (II) halides partially overlap with those of the decomposition, so a peak fitting procedure with a sum of gaussian functions was applied to separate the contributions of each process to the resulting DTA peak. All the compounds decompose according to a first order kinetics. Figure 3 Endothermic DTA peaks for the decomposition reaction of MAPbX 3
compounds. In the case of MAPbBr 3
and MAPbI 3
the endothermic peak of the decomposition event convolutes with the endothermic peak of the melting process of the corresponding lead (II) halide, so the contribution of each process was separated by a peak fitting procedure (sum of gaussians). The “shape index” of each decomposition peak has been used to obtain the order of reaction. Full size image Considering then a first order kinetics for the decomposition of the MAPbX 3
compounds and using the integrated form of the rate equation i.e.: the values of the kinetic constant
k
can be obtained at each of the temperatures of the isotherms used in the experiments;
n
is the number of moles of reactant,
t
is the time and the number 1 and 2 indicate initial and final state, respectively. By plotting the values of ln  k
vs the inverse of the absolute temperature and fitting them with a straight line, the apparent activation energies for the decomposition reactions can be obtained by the slope of the line, considering the Arrhenius equation: where
A
is the prefactor,
E a
the apparent activation energy,
R
the gas constant and
T
the absolute temperature. These plots are shown in
Fig. 4 . In all the cases the point at 130 °C was excluded because of the excessive uncertainty on the value of ln  k . In the case of MAPbCl 3
the value of ln  k
at 170 °C cannot be calculated because the decomposition of MAPbCl 3
was complete and so
equation (3)
cannot be applied. The obtained values of the apparent activation energies for the decomposition reactions are, considering the uncertainties, practically equal, being 68 ± 2 kJ/mol, 60 ± 10 kJ/mol and 80 ± 20 kJ/mol for MAPbCl 3 , MAPbBr 3
and MAPbI 3 , respectively. Figure 4 Plot of the values of ln  k
vs. the absolute temperature. From the slope of each linear fit, the values of the apparent activation energies for the decomposition reaction of each MAPbX 3
compound were calculated and from the equation of the lines the
k
and consequently the
values at 90 °C were estimated. Full size image For an estimation of the lifetime of the compounds under severe operative conditions of the devices, a value of
k
at 90 °C (which is a temperature that solar cells can reach under harsh conditions 15 ) can be extrapolated and from the value of
k , the half life of the compounds can be calculated. The estimated half-lives are 9, 12 and 170 days for MAPbCl 3 , MAPbBr 3
and MAPbI 3 , respectively. These values, though being simply rough estimations, pose a significant question about the possibility of using these compounds for the realization of stable solar cells, not considering all the problems related to other causes of degradation. Thermodynamic stability: Knudsen effusion mass spectrometry and Knudsen effusion mass loss Evaporation studies were performed with two different techniques based on molecular effusion: KEMS (Knudsen Effusion Mass Spectrometry) and KEML (Knudsen Effusion Mass Loss). Details of the experimental apparatus and techniques are given in the Methods section. With KEMS the nature and abundance of the effusing molecular species can be determined from the mass-spectrometrically detected ions and their measured intensities. In all three of the MAPbX 3
compounds here under study mass spectra were consistent with the aforementioned decomposition process (1), leading to the formation in the gas phase of methylamine and the corresponding hydrogen halide. Mass spectra were almost coincident with the reference spectra of such compounds. The relative intensities of methylamine and hydrogen halide ions varied depending on the system, as expected. Indeed, the fundamental equation correlating the individual molecular fluxes,
and the corresponding molecular densities
n ′ inside the cell is: where
is the average molecular speed. Fluxes and pressure are therefore correlated through the factor
, where
M
is the molecular mass. In order to maintain the stoichiometry of reaction (1), equal escaping fluxes of methylamine and HX are required, therefore the partial pressure ratios must satisfy the relation: Ratios are thus expected to be 0.93, 0.62 and 0.49 for MAPbCl 3 , MAPbBr 3
and MAPbI 3 , respectively. In our experiments the corresponding measured average ratios were found to be 1.01 ± 0.46, 0.56 ± 0.24 and 0.24 ± 0.10. While these ratios, even if largely scattered, are consistent with the decomposition stoichiometry of reaction (1) for MAPbCl 3 , MAPbBr 3 , a ratio smaller than expected was observed for MAPbI 3 . However, it should be noted that (see the Methods section), two species-dependent parameters affect the partial pressures derived from ion intensities: the electron impact cross section and the multiplier gain. Uncertainties in the estimation of these parameters would in turn affect the measured ratio. In this regard, we note that the deviation from the theoretical ratio increases with the difference between the masses of methylamine and HX, suggesting an inaccuracy in the estimation of the multiplier gain, which is usually assumed to be proportional to the reciprocal square root of the molecular mass. In conclusion, the occurrence of decomposition reactions as per
equation (1)
can be confidently considered to be consistent with the KEMS results. Moreover, as already noted, the X-ray diffraction analysis of the vaporization residues did not show any phase other than MAPbX 3
compounds and the corresponding lead (II) halides, so supporting these findings. Note that this decomposition behavior is the same observed for pure methylammonium chloride 16 . The discussion reported above on the partial pressure ratios measured with KEMS and the possible uncertainties in their determination paves the way for three alternative derivations of the equilibrium constant of reactions (1). Indeed one can chose to use either of the two partial pressures (methylamine and hydrogen halide) to evaluate the equilibrium constant, by imposing that the other one do obey the ratio consistent with
equation (1) . For example, assuming the measured partial pressure of methylamine as more reliable, the equilibrium constant
K p
can be evaluated as: As a third alternative, partial pressures measured for both species can be directly used in the
K p
evaluation. Considering the various uncertainties involved, such as ion current measurement, fragmentation processes, as well as cross section and multiplier gain estimations, we deemed the procedure based on the hydrogen halide partial pressure measurement as the most reliable. The methylamine and hydrogen halide partial pressures evaluated with this method are reported in
Table 1
of the
supplementary information
for all the MAPbX 3
compounds here under study. Results so derived will be detailed below, whereas the other two procedures will be used as an aid in estimating the overall reliability of the results. Table 1 Summary of the KEMS and KEML experiments and enthalpy changes for the decomposition reactions derived thereafter. Full size table In the experiments with the KEML technique (see the Method section), the observable is the overall rate of mass loss of the Knudsen effusion cell. In order to relate this quantity with the total pressure inside the cell the occurrence of the decomposition reaction (1) was assumed, consistently with mass spectrometric findings. The total pressures collected are reported in Table 2 of the
supplementary information . In turn, the equilibrium constant of this very same reaction can be related to the total pressure taking into account, as seen before, the relation between the partial pressures of methylamine and HX and the corresponding effusing fluxes: The resulting factors multiplicative of
are 0.250, 0.236 and 0.221 for the decomposition reaction of the chloride, bromide and iodide compound, respectively. It is also to be noted that, in the case of the KEML technique, experiments have been performed with different size of the effusion orifice (1 mm and 3 mm diameter) in search of the occurrence of any kinetically hindered evaporation, as it is sometimes reported for decomposition reactions 17 , 18 . Within the experimental uncertainties, however, no difference was observed in the total pressures measured with different orifices. All the
K p
data collected for reaction (1) experiments were analyzed with the two thermodynamic processing procedures known as second- and third-law methods, detailed in the Methods section. The main results of this analysis are listed in
Table 1 , where we report the enthalpy change for process (1) derived by applying the two methods to
K p
values obtained by KEML and by KEMS (in the latter case, by using the HX pressures to evaluate
K p ). Enthalpy change derived from the second-law analysis are reported both at the mean temperature of the experiments and to the reference temperature of 0 K. On looking at the results of
Table 1
it is apparent, for all the three systems, an excellent agreement between the third-law enthalpies of reaction derived by the two techniques. On comparing the second- and third-law results a more complex pattern comes out. While a rather good agreement was obtained for KEMS results in the case of MAPbCl 3 , MAPbBr 3
compounds, in the other cases the second law enthalpies are larger than the third-law ones by 7 to 18 kJ/mol. The quality of the original data is therefore to be evaluated as somewhat scattered. In addition, the second-law KEMS results were significantly dependent on which method, among the three mentioned above, is used to evaluate
K p , the scatter of the resulting enthalpies of reaction being in the order of 10–15 kJ/mol. The corresponding scatter of the third law values, on the contrary, was found to be of the same order of the small statistical errors reported in
Table 1 . Generally, the third law treatment of data is considered to be of superior quality if it is based, as it is here the case, on reliable free energy function values. The excellent agreement of the results obtained with the two independent experimental techniques KEMS and KEML leads us to take into account only the third-law results in proposing the final average values for the enthalpies of the reactions (1): The probable errors associated to the proposed values have been evaluated as half the maximum spread resulting both from the KEMS second-law values derived from the three different procedures used to calculate
K p
from pressure data (see above) and the difference between the third-law enthalpy and the corresponding second law value. The enthalpy change of reactions (1) allows one to derive the formation enthalpy of the corresponding perovskite phases at the usual reference temperature of 298 K. To this end, the formation enthalpies of gaseous hydrogen halides and solid lead halides were taken from the IVTANTHERMO database 19 , whereas the value for methylamine was retrieved from the compilation of ref.
17 . The resulting values of
were: −688.3 ± 7.8 kJ/mol, −567.5 ± 8.7 kJ/mol and −403.6 ± 9.7 kJ/mol for MAPbCl 3 , MAPbBr 3
and MAPbI 3 , respectively. Note that the decreasing trend of
absolute values is essentially due to the trend observed for the corresponding lead (II) halide and hydrogen halide species. The above derived enthalpies of decomposition enable us to evaluate the corresponding standard Gibbs energy changes as a function of temperature, useful for equilibrium calculations and thermodynamic simulations within a temperature range reasonably close to that covered in our experiments. To this end, the standard enthalpies and entropies of decomposition at the average experimental temperatures (see
Table 1 ) were evaluated with the heat content and free energy functions. The following expressions are finally obtained: In conclusion, our results suggest a more pronounced thermodynamic tendency of the MAPbCl 3
towards decomposition compared to MAPbBr 3
and MAPbI 3 . In order to facilitate an easy appreciation, from a practical point of view, of the stability of the studied perovskite phases, the total pressure dependence on the temperature is displayed in
Fig. 5 . Figure 5 Total decomposition pressure (in bar) of the perovskite phases under study as a function of the temperature. Circles, squares and rhombus for MAPbCl 3 , MAPbBr 3
and MAPbI 3 , respectively. Open symbols refer to the KEMS experiments, closed ones to KEML. Full size image It is worth noting that, by comparing the kinetic and thermodynamic data presented above, MAPbCl 3
results to be the most unstable compound both kinetically and thermodynamically. With regard to MAPbBr 3
and MAPbI 3 , while these two compounds have practically identical decomposition pressures in the explored temperature range (see
Fig. 5 ), MAPbI 3
is kinetically much more stable, as shown in
Fig. 4 . In summary, the studies of the MAPbX 3
compounds presented in this work clarify experimentally for the first time their decomposition path and highlight their limited thermal and thermodynamic stabilities and these are additional intrinsic problems that should be addressed in order to exploit their potential as photovoltaic materials in real life devices. Methods Materials preparation Lead (II) acetate trihydrate (99.0–103%), lead (II) chloride (reagent grade, 99%), hydrobromic acid 47% in water, hydroiodic acid 57% in water (stabilized with 1.5% hypophosphorous acid), methylamine 40% in water were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Hydrochloric acid 37% in water was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. The compounds were synthesized as powders according to literature procedure 20 . In the case of MAPbCl 3
a quantity of 37% HCl double with respect to literature procedure was necessary to dissolve the solid PbCl 2 . All the syntheses gave crystalline precipitates that were collected on a Büchner funnel under suction. In the case of MAPbI 3
the filtration was performed while the solution was still hot (T > 45–50 °C) to avoid the formation of (MA) 4 PbI 6 ∙2H 2 O 21 . After filtration, the solids were left under suction for at least 30 min to let them dry. MAPbCl 3
and MAPbBr 3
were then washed with acetone to remove the last traces of the mother solutions and left under suction for additional 30 min. The washing with acetone was not possible in the case of MAPbI 3 , which immediately decomposes in contact with the solvent, probably because of the traces of water present in the same. So after drying under suction, it was purified by keeping it in vacuum at 100 °C overnight. X-ray diffraction and non-ambient X-ray diffraction X-ray diffraction patterns on the as-synthesized samples were performed by using a Panalytical X’Pert Pro MPD diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.54184 Å) equipped with an ultra-fast X’Celerator RTMS detector. The angular resolution (in 2θ) was 0.001°. A 0.04 rad soller slit, a 1° divergence slit and a 20 mm mask have been used on the incident beam path, while a 6.6 mm anti-scatter slit, a Ni Kβ filter and a 0.04 rad collimator have been used on the diffracted beam path. For the non-ambient X-ray diffraction measurements, the diffractometer has been equipped with an Anton Paar XRK 900 reactor chamber with a factory calibrated automatic stage mover, using a Macor glass-ceramic sample holder. The position of the sample holder was calibrated at room temperature using the (104) reflection of powdered corundum. The experiments have been performed at atmospheric pressure under a protective flow of He gas (20 cm 3 /min @ STP, purity 99.999%). The optics used for the non-ambient measurements were the same as above with the exception of incident beam path mask (15 mm instead of 20 mm). All the scans were performed in the angular range 10–90° (in 2θ) with a scan time of 1 hour. The Rietveld analyses of the diffractograms taken in non-ambient conditions were performed by using the MAUD software package 22 . The necessary cif (crystallographic information file) files for the MAPbX 3
compounds were created from the literature data 12 , 23 , while for the lead (II) halides they were retrieved from the FIZ/NIST ICSD (Inorganic Crystal Structure Database) FindIt database 24 . Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) DTA measurements on the MAPbX 3
compounds were performed using a Netzsch STA 409 PC Luxx thermal analyzer. The DTA sensor was calibrated against the melting points of In, Sn, Zn, Al, Ag, Au and Ni at least 99.9% pure. The measurements were performed in sintered alumina crucibles under flowing Ar atmosphere (85 cm 3 /min @ STP, purity ≥ 99.9995%) with a scan rate of 10 K/min. Knudsen Effusion Mass Spectrometry (KEMS) The features of the Knudsen effusion mass spectrometry (KEMS) technique are well summarized in ref.
25
and references cited therein. The apparatus employed is a single focusing 90° magnetic sector mass spectrometer, originally by Patco, equipped with a Knudsen molecular source 26 . Graphite effusion cells with 1 mm diameter effusion holes, inserted in an outer molybdenum crucible, were used. The molecular source assembly is surrounded by a spiral-shaped tungsten as heating element and several tantalum shields. The temperature of the cell was measured with a Pt-Pt/Rh 10% thermocouple inserted in the bottom of the molybdenum container. Ionization of the vapours originated by the Knudsen molecular source was accomplished by electron impact with an electron emission current generally regulated at 1.0 mA. A secondary electron multiplier was used as a detector. The basic experimental data are the ion intensities,
, recorded as a function of the temperature of the molecular source. These can be converted into partial pressures of the corresponding neutral species in the Knudsen cell through the relation 25 : where
k
is the instrument sensitivity constant and the factor: specific to each ion
i , includes the electron impact ionization cross section
, the multiplier gain
and the isotopic abundance
a i . The instrument sensitivity constant has been evaluated, in the course of this study, with separate experiments of vaporization of pure zinc, whose vapor pressure is well known 19 . The ionization cross section of methylamine (5.60 Å 2 ) was taken from ref.
27 , those for HCl (3.76 Å 2 ), HBr (4.65 Å 2 ) and HI (6.47 Å 2 ) from ref.
28 . The multiplier gains were assumed to be proportional to the inverse square of the molecular ion mass, as usual in KEMS 25 . Knudsen Effusion Mass Loss (KEML) A Ugine-Eyraud Model B60 Setaram thermobalance was used for the KEML measurements. A graphite resistor is the heating element of a quartz tube containing the Knudsen cell. The effusion source, whose mass is monitored, was specifically modified in our laboratory 29
in order to allow an optimal temperature measurement and to maximize the uniformity of the sample temperature. Briefly, both the Knudsen cell and a Pt100 platinum resistance thermometer are inserted into a capped copper cylinder; so that the temperature of the molecular source is directly measured instead of the usual “dummy” cell placed in the isothermal section of the furnace. Effusion cells made of pyrophyllite were used, with effusion hole diameters of 1 and 3 mm. The vapor pressures of the sample were obtained by the usual Knudsen equation: where
T
is the temperature,
K
a constant depending on the geometrical characteristics of the effusion hole,
dm/dt
the rate of mass loss.
M av
is the average molar mass of the effusing vapor: where
m i
are the weight fractions of the various vapor species in the effusate and
M i
the respective molecular weights. Thermodynamic analysis of
K p
data Equilibrium data have been analyzed by the so-called second- and third-law methods of analysis 25 . With the second-law method the determination of the enthalpy change at the average temperature of the experiment,
, is performed by a least square analysis of a van’t Hoff plot, ln
K p
vs. 1/ T , where
K p
is the equilibrium constant. The corresponding enthalpy change at the reference temperature, in our case 0 K,
, can be calculated through the use of the heat content functions,
( ) of reactants and products. A single
value is obtained from the entire set of data points. The third-law procedure, based on the relation: where
is the Gibbs energy function
, provides a value of
for each experimental point. The advantages and shortcomings of these two independent methods of analysis of primary experimental data are reported in ref.
25 . In short, although the third law analysis, unlike the second-law, requires the more demanding knowledge of the absolute values of partial pressures, third-law results are considered to be superior and to be preferred when thermal functions are sufficiently well established, because they are less sensitive to random errors. Auxiliary thermodynamic functions Free energy functions of gaseous hydrogen halides and solid lead halides were retrieved from the IVTANTHERMO database 19 , whereas those of methylamine were taken from ref.
30 . The heat capacity
of the MAPbX 3
compounds have been measured in ref.
31
up to 300 K for MAPbCl 3
and MAPbBr 3
and up to 360 K for MAPbI 3 . The same authors derived, in the same temperature range, the thermodynamic functions
,
,
. These thermodynamic functions have been here evaluated up to 450 K in order to cover the range of temperatures of our experiments. To this end, heat capacity data were extrapolated using the Einstein and Debye temperatures provided by the same authors. The resulting values are reported in the Table 3 of the

Devices for energy harvesting Solar cells
Abstract Operating stability has become a priority issue for all-perovskite tandem solar cells. Inorganic CsPbI 3− x Br x
perovskites, which have good photostability against halide segregation, are promising alternatives for all-perovskite tandem solar cells. However, the interface between organic transport layers and inorganic perovskite suffers from a large energetic mismatch and inhibits charge extraction compared with hybrid analogues, resulting in low open-circuit voltages and fill factors. Here we show that inserting at this interface a passivating dipole layer having high molecular polarity—a molecule that interacts strongly with both inorganic perovskite and C 60 —reduces the energetic mismatch and accelerates the charge extraction. This strategy resulted in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.5% in wide-bandgap (WBG) devices. We report all-perovskite tandems using an inorganic WBG subcell, achieving a PCE of 25.6% (steady state 25.2%). Encapsulated tandems retain 96% of their initial performance after 1,000 h of simulated 1-sun operation at the maximum power point.

All-perovskite tandem solar cells with 3D/3D bilayer perovskite heterojunction

08 June 2023
Main All-perovskite tandem solar cells consisting of wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskite (~1.8 eV) and narrow-bandgap (NBG) perovskite (~1.2 eV) absorber layers extend the usable range of the solar spectrum and reduce thermalization losses in single-junction solar cells 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . The highest reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) of all-perovskite tandem solar cells (26.4%) (ref.
5 ) has exceeded the best-performing single-junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs) (25.7%) (ref.
6 ); however, long-term stability remains a major bottleneck for commercial application, which requires a product lifetime of approximately 20–25 years (ref.
7 ). A mixed iodine–bromine WBG perovskite is required in tandems to achieve a high open-circuit voltage ( V OC ), yet photoinstability of WBG organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites limits long-term stability 8 . Efficient tandem devices made using a hybrid WBG layer have so far maintained only >90% of initial PCE for 600 h of operation at their maximum power point (MPP) 5 . Inorganic CsPbI 3− x Br x
perovskites exhibit increased photostability 9 , 10 , 11
and excellent thermal stability, so they are good candidates for WBG absorbers 12 , 13 , 14 . Despite this promise, the performance of all-inorganic PSCs, especially in the inverted p–i–n device structure, lags far behind organic−inorganic PSCs, a limitation dominated by low
V OC
and fill factors (FF) 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , as listed in Supplementary Table
1 . We reasoned that fast crystallization with uncontrolled intermediate phases results in poor film quality for all-inorganic perovskites 20 , 21 , 22 . The high density of interfacial defects leads to poor contact between the CsPbI 3− x Br x
perovskite and electron-transport layers (ETL), which demands more effective passivation strategies. Another key challenge is that WBG CsPbI 3− x Br x
perovskite has an inferior energetic alignment with ETL 23 , 24 , especially for C 60
that is commonly used in the inverted architecture 16 , 25 . Inorganic perovskites typically have higher conduction band minimums (CBM) than the equivalent hybrid perovskite at the same bandgap 26 , 27 , 28 . The large conduction band offset (ΔEc ≈ 0.7 eV) at this interface not only severely hinders charge extraction and leads to large
V OC
losses 29 , 30 , 31
but also triggers the hysteresis in the response of current density–voltage ( J – V ) curves 32 . Molecules with a π-conjugated backbone have the potential to passivate trap states and facilitate charge transfer 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 . Organic passivators with an asymmetric structure can induce an intramolecular dipole moment across an interface owing to the unequal electronegativity. In this Article, we find that introducing a dipole layer with high molecular polarity at the perovskite/C 60
interface reconfigures interfacial states to improve band alignment and increase the binding between inorganic perovskite and organic contacts. This strategy enables a PCE of 18.5% with a
V OC
of 1.23 V and average FF > 0.83 and an operational stability for over 2,000 h without PCE degradation under 1-sun illumination in WBG PSCs. Using this all-inorganic WBG subcell, we report all-perovskite tandem solar cells with a PCE of 25.6%. Encapsulated tandem devices exhibit promising operating stability, maintaining 96% of their initial performance after over 1,000 h operation at MPP. Molecular structure design strategy Here we pursued a π-conjugated molecular structure to insert into perovskite/C 60
interface (Fig.
1a ). Starting with the commonly used passivant phenethylammonium (PEA) cations, we seek to regulate the electric dipole moment by introducing either F atom (4-Fluorophenethylammonium (F-PEA)) or CF3 group (4-(Trifluoromethyl) phenethylammonium (CF3-PEA)) at the para position of the amino group (Fig.
1b
and Supplementary Fig.
1 ). For this type of ammonium ligand, their −NH 3 +
side tends to interact with the perovskite surface 37 , 38 , while the other side interacts with the C 60
contact layer. The maximum electrostatic potential ( φ max ) at the −NH 3 +
side of each ligand is such that:
φ max,PEA  <  φ max,F-PEA  <  φ max,CF3-PEA ; while the minimum electrostatic potential ( φ min ) at the other side is:
φ min,PEA  >  φ min,F-PEA  >  φ min,CF3-PEA . We posited that the higher
φ max
could increase the binding strength between the inorganic perovskite and passivator and that the lower
φ min
could increase the binding strength between ETL and passivated perovskite layers. The large difference between
φ max
and
φ min
within a ligand usually suggests high molecular polarity. We found that the dipole moments for the neutral molecules increase as the number of electron-withdrawing F groups increases (Supplementary Table
2 ). Fig. 1: Density functional theory calculations of surface passivation and interfacial charge transport. a , Schematic structure of inverted CsPbI 3− x Br x

Full size image We carried out density functional theory (DFT) calculations to understand how the molecular structure of each passivator affects defect passivation and charge transport at the perovskite/ETL interface. Among the three passivation molecules, CF3-PEA binds to the perovskite most strongly by occupying the caesium vacancy site (Fig.
1c ), in accordance with its highest
φ max
when compared with PEA and F-PEA. A stronger binding with the perovskite surface suggests a more effective surface passivation because defective sites are more likely to be passivated. We revealed that in-gap states induced by deep-level defects, that is I-Pb antisites, are eliminated after passivation with PEA or CF3-PEA (Supplementary Fig.
2 ). The DFT simulation results herein indicate that better surface passivation enabled by CF3-PEA is mainly ascribed to stronger binding with defect sites on the perovskite surface. To study how the passivating molecules affect interfacial charge transport, we explored the interaction between the C 60
layer and the perovskite surface and charge extraction at the perovskite/C 60
interface. As shown in Fig.
1d , capping passivators induce notable charge redistribution. Charge accumulation within C 60
molecules is repressed when passivated by PEA molecules and is further promoted in cases by F-PEA and CF3-PEA passivated perovskite. The adsorption energy ( E ads ) of C 60
on the control (bare), PEA, F-PEA and CF3-PEA passivated (110) perovskite surfaces are −0.47, −0.53, −0.57 and −0.71 eV, respectively. This indicates that the interaction between C 60
and CF3-PEA passivated perovskite is strongest among the three passivators, which reduces device charge transfer resistance and accelerates interfacial charge transfer 39 . We used the Heyd−Scuseria−Ernzerhof (HSE) including spin-orbital coupling (SOC) method to calculate the projected density of states (PDOS) of C 60 /perovskite heterojunction (Fig.
1e ). It can be found that these passivators (PEA, F-PEA and CF3-PEA) do not introduce sub-bandgap states. The CBM of the entire heterojunction originates from C 60
components. For the control and PEA passivated systems, the first conduction band (CB) of the perovskite component is far from the first CB of the C 60
component. However, for the CF3-PEA passivated system, the first two CBs become much closer in energy, and thus the CBMs of C 60
and perovskite align with each other. This indicates that electron extraction from the CF3-PEA passivated perovskite layer to the C 60
layer is more efficient than that in the control, PEA and F-PEA passivated cases 40 . We further studied the work function (WF) changes and CBM shifts upon three passivator treatments (Supplementary Table
3
and Supplementary Table
4 ). We found that F-PEA and CF3-PEA exhibit an increased WF and CBM downshift compared with the bare surface, while PEA exhibits a decreased WF and CBM upshift compared with the bare surface. The WF shift originates from two contributions 41 , 42 , the intrinsic dipole of the ligands ( µ intrinsic ) and the dipole created by the interaction between the ligands and the perovskite surface ( µ interaction ).
µ intrinsic
and
µ interaction
lie in opposite directions along the
z
axis of the surface slabs and thus have an opposite effect on the WF. Because PEA has a lower molecular polarity, its
µ intrinsic
contribution was less than that of F-PEA and CF3-PEA and therefore insufficient to negate the WF decrease contributed by the
µ interaction
term, resulting in an overall WF decrease. We thus offer that in cationic-type passivated cases, a higher molecular polarity helps to induce a WF increase and improve electron extraction. Photovoltaic performance of CsPbI 3− x Br x
PSCs employing dipole layers DFT calculations indicated that CF3-PEA has the potential to provide more effective surface passivation and improved interfacial electron extraction than conventional PEA. To test this idea, we fabricated all-inorganic CsPbI 3− x Br x
PSCs in the inverted p–i–n architecture to evaluate the effects of the three passivators on photovoltaic (PV) performance, and the preparation process is shown in Supplementary Fig.
3 . The optimized concentration in isopropanol (IPA) of PEA, F-PEA and CF3-PEA were all 1.0 mol% relative to Cs +

The device had an initial PCE of 16.8%. The operating temperature of the device was around 35 °C, and the relative humidity was approximately 30–40%.

up to 1.23 V, a gain of 220 mV compared with control devices. Accompanied with a noticeable FF improvement (80.7% to 82.8%) and high
J SC
(18.1 mA cm −2 ), the champion CF3-PEA device achieved a high PCE of 18.5%, the highest value for inverted all-inorganic perovskite with a bandgap around 1.8 eV. The steady-state PCE of the CF3-PEA device is 18.3% (Supplementary Fig.
5 ), well matched with the PCE determined from
J – V
scans. The

calculated from external quantum efficiency (EQE) agrees well with the value from

measurement (Fig.

shows the PCE histogram of 120 CF3-PEA passivated devices with an average PCE of 17.3% and a narrow distribution with standard deviation of 0.49%. The hysteresis index (defined as (PCE reverse  – PCE forward ) / PCE reverse  × 100%) of control, PEA, F-PEA and CF3-PEA devices are 13.9%, 11.1%, 4.0% and 3.0%, respectively (Fig.
2c ). The CF3-PEA device had the lowest hysteresis (PCEs of 18.5% vs 18.0% between reverse and forward scans), which is good compared with that of high-performance all-inorganic PSCs reported previously 43 , 44 . This we attribute to defect passivation by CF3-PEA and improved band alignment at the perovskite/C 60
interface 45 , 46 , a trend also seen in DFT. We investigated the operational stability of all-inorganic CsPbI 3− x Br x
PSCs using a multi-colour LED solar simulator with intensity equivalent to 100 mW cm −2
by continuously tracking the MPP in ambient conditions. The encapsulated CF3-PEA device maintained its initial PCE during 2,000 h of MPP operation (Fig.
2d ). We studied the role, in achieving higher photostability, of the all-inorganic CsPbI 3− x Br x
films vs the effect of the dipole layer. Both the control and CF3-PEA-treated devices did not show any light-induced phase segregation after 20 minutes of 10-sun equivalent illumination. In contrast, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite films with a similar bandgap exhibited serious phase separation under identical illumination conditions (Fig.
2d
inset and Supplementary Fig.
7 ). The inorganic PSCs also had higher thermal stability than do the organic–inorganic hybrid devices under 85 °C thermal stress (Supplementary Fig.
8
and Supplementary Fig.
9 ). Characterization of CsPbI 3−
x Br x
perovskite films Next we sought to characterize the morphology and crystalline structure of CsPbI 3− x Br x
perovskite films to reveal the interaction between perovskites and passivators. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show dense, pinhole-free control films; the morphologies of films are unchanged after passivation (Fig.
3a ). Passivation treatments did not affect the overall crystallinity and no new phase was formed, as evidenced by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig.
3b ). If the concentration of passivators increased, we found peaks at low angles (2θ < 10°) appear, which correspond to diffraction signals of the original molecules (Supplementary Fig.
10 ). Once we used IPA to wash the high-concentration capping layers, all of these impurity XRD peaks disappeared. These results indicate that the passivators do not form 2D perovskite capping layers 47 , something we assign to the strong resistance of Cs +
to ion exchange, which is consistent with previously reported results 48 , 49 . The thin passivation layers also did not alter UV–vis absorption, and the band edges remain nearly unchanged (~1.77 eV) (Supplementary Fig.
11 ). The PV bandgap estimated from the EQE spectra is about 1.78 eV (ref.
50 ) (Supplementary Fig.
12 ), which is comparable with the optical bandgap value of 1.77 eV (Supplementary Fig.
11 ). Fig. 3: Characterization of CsPbI 3− x Br x

films are determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement. The XPS spectra of N 1 s
and F 1 s
shown in Fig.
3c,d
indicate the existence of the passivator molecules on the surface of passivated films. The Pb 4 f
XPS spectrum of the control film contains two main peaks at 138.06 eV and 142.92 eV, corresponding to the Pb 4 f
7/2 and 5/2 orbitals, respectively. The Pb 4 f
peaks in the PEA passivated film shift towards higher binding energy by 0.08 eV, whereas the F-PEA and CF3-PEA passivated films shift to lower binding energies by 0.07 eV and 0.14 eV (Fig.
3e ), respectively. The XPS core level spectra of Cs 3 d , I 3 d
and Br 3 d
in perovskite are shown in Supplementary Fig.
13 . The shift direction of binding energy for elements (Pb/Cs/I/Br) show the same trend, though the shift values are slightly different (Supplementary Table
5 ). In perovskite films with each passivator, the binding energy shift of Cs is the largest among characterized elements, indicating that the passivators have a stronger interaction with Cs 31 , 33 . We further performed ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) to investigate the surface energetics of perovskite films and C 60
layers (Supplementary Fig.
14
and Supplementary Fig.
15 ). From UPS we can see that PEA treatment decreases the WF of CsPbI 3− x Br x
film surfaces from 4.86 to 4.83 eV with respect to the vacuum level, while F-PEA and CF3-PEA passivated films exhibit deeper WFs of 5.08 eV and 5.34 eV, respectively (Fig.
3f ). The ΔEc between the CBM of CsPbI 3− x Br x
and pure C 60
(4.35 eV) for control, PEA-, F-PEA- and CF3-PEA-treated films are 0.74, 0.89, 0.44 and 0.16 eV, respectively. We also provide the estimated energetics of C 60
coated on different passivation perovskite films (Supplementary Fig.
16 ). The energy-level alignment was presented as referenced to the vacuum level and Fermi level ( E F ), respectively (Supplementary Fig.
17 ). We found that the PEA enlarges the ΔEc between the perovskite and C 60 , while the F-PEA and CF3-PEA dipole layers reduce the ΔEc offset, which is consistent with the results obtained from separately measured C 60
on top of glass/ITO. Our DFT calculations also support above experimental results of the WF changes and CBM shift upon three passivator treatments. Drift-diffusion modelling shows that the approximately 210 mV
V OC
increase in CF3-PEA-treated devices can be linked to a reduced energy-level mismatch between perovskite and ETL (ΔEc) and trap passivation at the perovskite surface. When we vary the surface trap density, ΔEc presents the dominant effect. The model indicates that ΔEc affects
V OC
in two ways: increased recombination at the perovskite/C 60
interface, which reduces quasi Fermi level splitting (QFLS), and losses purely related to band alignment where the
V OC
is lower than the bulk QFLS (Supplementary Fig.
18 ). We measured the ideality factor of devices using each treatment (Supplementary Fig.
19 ); values of the control, PEA, F-PEA and CF3-PEA devices were 1.32, 1.25, 1.22 and 1.17, respectively. Reduced ideality factor of devices indicates suppressed non-radiative recombination. We measured the electroluminescence spectra of control and passivated PSC devices, operating as LEDs (Supplementary Fig.
20 ). The CF3-PEA-passivated devices achieved significantly higher electroluminescence intensity at various applied bias. Combined with the lowest ideality factors for the CF3-PEA passivated device, we confirm that CF3-PEA exhibits the most efficient suppression of trap-assisted recombination in devices among these three passivators. We performed steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) to probe the radiative recombination and carrier transfer behaviour in CsPbI 3− x Br x
films. The passivated CsPbI 3− x Br x
films exhibit suppressed defect-induced non-radiative recombination, as evidenced by the increased PL intensities (Fig.
4a ). As shown in Fig.
4b , the CF3-PEA film coated with C 60
shows PL enhancement, indicating the C 60
does not induce as much recombination as it does for the control. This is due to passivation of surface defects and the band mismatch between the C 60
and the perovskite surface. The PEA device is not worse than the control (bigger mismatch) because the QFLS of films does not decrease beyond a mismatch of approximately 0.3 eV. And then the PEA film has a lower defect density. Figure
4c
presents TRPL of perovskite/C 60
junctions, from which we calculated the differential lifetime (Fig.
4d ) to distinguish charge extraction vs trap-assisted recombination. The first interval at shorter times is dominated by the transfer of electrons from the bulk into the C 60 , and the second interval at longer delay times is dominated by interfacial recombination 51 , 52 , 53 . The sharp drop in emission for CF3-PEA/C 60
indicates efficient electron transfer at the interface, and the high plateau suggests a reduced trap density. We obtained the same trend under an increased excitation fluence of 58.3 nJ cm −2
(Supplementary Fig.
21
and Supplementary Table
8 ). Drift-diffusion modelling shows that the maximum achievable
J SC
based on absorption is 18.4 mA cm −2 , assuming that all absorbed photons contribute to the current (Supplementary Fig.
18d ). CF3-PEA-treated devices show an average
J SC
increase of 0.5 mA cm −2
compared with control devices (Supplementary Note
1 ). Fig. 4: PL properties of perovskite films with different dipole layers. a , b , Steady-state PL spectra of perovskite films ( a ) and perovskite films coated with C 60

perovskite for the WBG subcells (Fig.
5a,b ). The champion tandem device exhibited a PCE of 25.6% under reverse scan with a
V OC
of 2.00 V,
J SC
of 16.1 mA cm −2
and FF of 79.6% (Fig.
5c
and Table
2 ). The integrated
J SC
values of the WBG and NBG subcells from EQE spectra are 16.2 and 16.4 mA cm −2 , respectively, in good agreement with the
J SC
values determined from
J – V
measurements (Fig.
5d ). The champion tandem device exhibited a stabilized PCE of 25.2% measured over 120 s (Fig.
5e ). Figure
5f
shows the PCE histogram of 50 tandem solar cells processed among several batches, indicating an average PCE of 24.3% and a good reproducibility. The photovoltaic performance of tandem solar cells with all-inorganic WBG subcells is comparable to that of tandem devices with inorganic–organic hybrid WBG perovskites reported in our previous studies 54 , 55 .

Source data Full size image Table 2 Champion PV parameters of the WBG subcell with C 60 /ALD-SnO 2
structure, the NBG subcell and the all-perovskite tandem device Full size table We found that the performance of CsPbI 3− x Br x
PSCs slightly reduced in
V OC
and FF after replacing the C 60 /BCP-based ETL with C 60 /ALD-SnO 2 (ALD-SnO 2 : SnO 2
using atomic layer deposition), required in all-perovskite tandem solar cells (Supplementary Fig.
22 ). The performance reduction of devices with the ALD-SnO 2
layer could be explained by the following factors: (1) the approximately 100 minute-long heating at 75 °C during ALD processing possibly altered the metastable state of the all-inorganic perovskites 56 ; (2) the vacuum environment during ALD may accelerate the phase transition of all-inorganic perovskites 57 ; (3) the moisture injected during water pulses could be harmful to all-inorganic perovskites, of which the phase is very sensitive to moisture 48 , 58 . Device stability is crucial for the commercialization of all-perovskite tandems. We investigated long-term operational stability under simulated 1-sun illumination. We tracked the power output of encapsulated devices at their MPP in ambient air under a multi-colour LED solar simulator with intensity equivalent to 100 mW cm −2 . The tandem devices exhibit promising operational stability and maintained 96% of initial PCE after MPP operation over 1,000 h (Fig.
5g ), which is superior to the tandem devices with mixed-cation and mixed-halide hybrid WBG perovskites in previous reports 59 , 60 . The inorganic WBG perovskites enable a substantial advance in operating stability, yet work remains to be done to increase the PCEs of all-perovskite tandem devices. To achieve PCEs beyond 30%, the
V OC
of the WBG front subcell must improve from 1.23 V reported here to greater than 1.4 V, something that may be obtained by further suppressing bulk and surface recombination. Regulating the rapid nucleation and crystallization process of all-inorganic perovskite films with additive and composition engineering is expected to reduce the bulk trap density. Higher
V OC
is further expected by reducing the hole transport layer/perovskite interfacial recombination losses. Another focus will be on further improving the phase stability of WBG inorganic perovskites, something enabled by composition engineering, to avoid performance degradation in front subcells during the sequent deposition steps of the tunnel recombination junction and NBG bottom subcells. We project that by combining such efforts, it will become possible to achieve PCEs of all-perovskite tandem solar cells that reach towards those of hybrid subcells. Conclusions This work demonstrates efficient and stable all-perovskite tandem solar cells with an all-inorganic WBG subcell that provides improved photostability over hybrid perovskites. We demonstrate a strongly bonding electric dipole interlayer using high-polarity CF3-PEA molecules to passivate surface defects and regulate interfacial energy-level alignment, resulting in suppressed non-radiative charge recombination and improved interfacial electron extraction. Using the CF3-PEA passivator, inverted all-inorganic CsPbI 3− x Br x
PSCs show a PCE of 18.5% with excellent operating stability over 2,000 h. We further achieve an efficiency of 25.6% (steady state 25.2%) in an all-perovskite tandem solar cell using a CsPbI 3− x Br x
WBG subcell. The encapsulated tandem devices retain 96% of their initial performance after 1,000 h of simulated 1-sun illumination. This 1,000-h lifetime appears to surpass—by fully a factor of four times—the longest-operating lifetime reported in all-perovskite tandem cells 5 . The strategy contributes a facile route towards efficient and stable all-perovskite tandem solar cells. Methods First-principles calculations First-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) were carried out using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package 61 . For the exchange-correlation functional, the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional 62
and the screened Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid functional 63 , 64
were adopted. In addition, DFT-D3 method was used for the van der Waals correction 65 . The spin-orbital coupling (SOC) effect was included. The mixing parameter ( α ) of the Hartree–Fock term in HSE + SOC calculations was set to 0.45, which had been proven to reproduce the experimental bandgap. The plane-wave cut-off energy was 400 eV. The energy and force convergence criteria were set to 10 −5  eV and 0.03 eV Å −1 , respectively. The Brillouin zone was sampled with Γ-centred
k -mesh densities of 2π × 0.03 Å −1
in the calculations of the energetic and electronic properties. We used a vacuum of 20 Å to separate neighbouring surfaces in the
z
direction. The binding energies of different ammonium cations (PEA, F-PEA and CF3-PEA) with the perovskite surface were calculated as
E mol/pvsk  –  E pvsk  –  E mol , where
E mol/pvsk ,
E pvsk
and
E mol
are the total energies of the adsorption system, the perovskite system and CF3-PEAI/F-PEAI/PEAI (I represents iodide), respectively. A higher binding energy value indicates a stronger binding strength with the perovskite surface. The adsorption energies ( E ads ) of C 60
with different ammonium cations (PEA, F-PEA and CF3-PEA) passivated and bare perovskite surface were calculated as
E (C 60 @perovskite) −  E (C 60 ) −  E (perovskite). The electrostatic potentials ( φ ) of the passivators were calculated in the Gaussian 09 package at the B3LYP/def2TZVP level with DFT-D3. The maximum
φ
( φ max ) and minimum
φ
( φ min ) in these passivators were obtained with the help of Multiwfn code 66 . Drift-diffusion modelling for device-performance simulation We used SCAPS-1D (a solar cell capacitance simulator) to build the device model 67 . Detailed simulation methods are illustrated in Supplementary Fig.

perovskite, DMAI:CsI:PbBr 2 :PbI 2 :PbCl 2
(molar ratio = 0.9:1:0.45:0.55:0.1) were dissolved in mixed DMF and DMSO solvents (volume ratio = 1:1.4) at a concentration of 0.95 M and were stirred at 60 °C in a N 2
glovebox for 2 h before film fabrication. The precursor solution was filtered through a 0.22 μm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane before making the perovskite films. For NBG FA 0.7 MA 0.3 Pb 0.5 Sn 0.5 I 3
perovskite, the precursor solution (2.0 M) was prepared in mixed solvents of DMF and DMSO with a volume ratio of 2:1. The molar ratios for FAI/MAI and PbI 2 /SnI 2
were 0.7:0.3 and 0.5:0.5, respectively. The molar ratio of (FAI + MAI)/(PbI 2  + SnI 2 ) was 1:1. SnF 2
(10 mol% relative to SnI 2 ) was added in the precursor solution. The precursor solution was stirred at room temperature for 2 h. Tin powders (5 mg ml −1 ) and FSA (0.3 mol%) were added in the precursor to reduce Sn 4+
in the precursor solution. The precursor solution with the remaining tin powders was filtered through a 0.22 μm PTFE membrane before making the perovskite films. All-inorganic perovskite solar cell fabrication The pre-patterned ITO glass was sequentially washed with water, acetone and IPA sequentially and then treated with UV–ozone for 15 min before use. The NiO layer was spin coated onto the ITO substrate with a NiO nanocrystal suspension (20 mg ml −1
in water) at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s and subsequently annealed at 100 °C for 10 min in air. Self-assembled molecules (SAM) were used to optimize the NiO film 69 . The solutions of 2PACz and MeO-2PACz with the same concentration (0.2 mmol l −1
in IPA) were mixed with 1:3 ratio and then were spin coated on the NiO film at 4,000 r.p.m. for 20 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 5 min. After cooling, the substrates were immediately transferred to the glovebox. The perovskite precursor was spin coated on NiO/SAM at 2,600 r.p.m. for 150 s and was kept in the N 2
glovebox for 1 h before heating. The samples were then taken out from the glovebox and annealed at 170 °C for 20 min in ambient air with a humidity below 40%. For surface passivation, the passivation solution in IPA (1 mol%) was drop cast on perovskite film at 5,000 r.p.m. for 20 s, followed by drying at 90 °C for 3 min. Then the cooled films were washed by IPA at 5,000 r.p.m. for 20 s. After the cooling to room temperature, the substrates were transferred to the evaporation system. Finally, C 60
(20 nm), BCP (7 nm) and Cu (100 nm) were sequentially deposited on top of the perovskite by thermal evaporation. Monolithic all-perovskite tandem solar cell fabrication The CsPbI 3− x Br x
films were prepared as mentioned above. The substrates were transferred to the evaporation system after the fabrication of all-inorganic perovskite films, and 20-nm-thick C 60
film was deposited on top by thermal evaporation at a rate of 0.2 Å s −1 . The substrates were then transferred to the atomic layer deposition (ALD) system (Veeco Savannah S200) to deposit 20 nm SnO 2
at 75 °C using precursors of tetrakis(dimethylamino) tin(IV) (99.9999%, Nanjing Ai Mou Yuan Scientific Equipment Co.) and deionized water. After ALD deposition, the substrates were transferred back to the thermal evaporation system to deposit an ultra-thin layer of Au clusters layer (~1 nm) on ALD-SnO 2 . PEDOT:PSS layers were spin cast on top of front cells and annealed in air at 120 °C for 20 min. After the substrates had cooled, we immediately transferred the substrates to a nitrogen-filled glovebox for the deposition of NBG perovskite films. The perovskite films were deposited with two-step spin-coating procedures: (1) 1,000 r.p.m. for 10 s with a ramp up of 200 r.p.m. s −1
and (2) 4,000 r.p.m. for 40 s with a ramp up of 1,000 r.p.m. s −1 . Ethyl acetate (200 µl) was dropped on the spinning substrate during the second spin-coating step at 20 s before the end of the procedure. Finally, 20 nm C 60 , 7 nm BCP and 150 nm Cu films were sequentially deposited by thermal evaporation (Beijing Technol Science). Details on the deposition of ALD-SnO 2
layers can be found in our previous work 55 . Characterization of solar cells For single-junction solar cells, the
J – V
characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter under the illumination of the solar simulator (EnliTech, Class AAA) at the light intensity of 100 mW cm −2
as checked with National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)-calibrated reference solar cells (KG-5 and KG-0 reference cells were used for the measurements of WBG and NBG solar cells, respectively). Unless otherwise stated, the
J – V
curves were all measured under the same conditions 70
in a nitrogen-filled glovebox with a scanning rate of 200 mV s −1
(voltage steps of 20 mV and a delay time of 100 ms). The active area was determined by the aperture shade mask (0.049 cm 2 ) placed in front of the solar cells. EQE measurements were performed in ambient air using a QE system (EnliTech) with monochromatic light focused on device pixel and a chopper frequency of 20 Hz. For tandem solar cells, the
J – V
characteristics were carried out under the illumination of a two-lamp high-spectral-match solar simulator (SAN-EI ELECTRIC, XHS-50S1). The spectrum from the simulator was finely tuned to ensure that spectral mismatch is within 100 ± 3% for each 50-nm interval between wavelength range 400 nm and 1,000 nm. The solar simulator was set at the light intensity of 100 mW cm −2
as checked with a calibrated crystalline silicon reference solar cell with a quartz window (KG-0) (detailed discussion in Supplementary Note
2 ). EQE measurements were performed in ambient air, and the bias illumination from highly bright LEDs with emission peaks of 850 nm and 460 nm were used for the measurements of the front and back subcells, respectively. No bias voltage was applied during the EQE measurements of tandems. Operational stability tests of solar cells The operating stability tests were carried out under simulated AM1.5 G illumination (Class AAA, multi-colour LED solar simulator, Guangzhou Crysco Equipment Co.) with an intensity of 100 mW cm −2
using a home-built LabVIEW-based MPP tracking system and a perturb and observe method in ambient conditions (humidity of 30–50%). The solar cells were encapsulated with a cover glass and UV epoxy (Three Bond), which was cured under an UV–LED lamp (peak emission at 365 nm) for 3 min. No UV filter was applied during operation. The MPP ageing was performed at room temperature, and the device temperature was increased to around 35−40 °C during operation due to the self heating under illumination. There was no active cooling during the measurement stage. The illumination intensity was regularly calibrated to check the degradation of the LED lamp. Other characterizations XRD patterns were acquired using a Bruker D8 AVANTAGE Diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 1.54 Å) radiation. XPS analysis was carried out using the Thermo Scientific Al K-Alpha XPS system with energy steps of 0.1 eV. SEM images were obtained using a TESCAN microscope with an accelerating voltage of 2 kV. Optical absorption measurements were carried out in a Lambda 950 UV/Vis spectrophotometer. PL measurements were conducted on a home-built wide-field microscope based on Olympus IX73. A 532 nm diode laser was used as the excitation light for the sample measurements with the laser power density on the film surface of 100 mW cm −2 . The fluorescence of the samples was collected by a dry objective lens (Olympus LUCPlanFI 40×, Numerical Aperture (NA) = 0.6) and detected by an Electron Multiplying Charge-Coupled Device (EMCCD) camera (iXon Ultra 888, Andor) after passing through 550 nm (ET550LP, Chroma) long-pass filters. TRPL was measured using a Horiba Fluorolog-3 time-correlated single photon counting system; the samples were excited using a pulsed laser with a wavelength of 485 nm (2 MHz, 5.83 nj cm −2
and 58.3 nj cm −2 ) from the glass side. The PL decay curves were fitted with biexponential components to obtain a fast and a slow decay lifetime. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed in an ultrahigh vacuum surface analysis system equipped with a fast entry load lock, a transfer chamber and an analysis chamber (base pressure approximately 10 −10  mbar). UPS employed the He I 21.22 eV as the excitation source with an energy resolution of 50 meV. The work function was derived from the secondary electron cut-off and the ionization potential from the frontier edge of the occupied density states to the vacuum level. The LED device characterizations were carried out with a Keithley 2400 source meter and a 100 mm integrating sphere coupled with a spectrometer (Ocean Optics, Spectrum TEQ-EQY).

Abstract
Metal halide perovskite materials (ABX 3 ) employed in optoelectronic devices have rapidly achieved high efficiencies. Their performance can be partially attributed to intrinsic defects being electronically benign. Despite the inertness of defects within the bulk, such as ion vacancies, solution processing additives and surface passivation have been shown to enhance material properties. Thus, detailed knowledge of additive chemistry is desirous to elucidate passivation mechanisms and facilitate further improvements. In particular, the soft Lewis acid nature of Pb 2+
has been overlooked heretofore as a key feature of amine-lead chemistry in perovskite preparations. In Part I of this study, we demonstrate that acid–base reactions between PbI 2
and aliphatic amines yield alkylammonium and Pb–alkylamide species. The alkylammonium and alkylamide products are capable of occupying A-site cation and anion vacancies, respectively. Subsequent incorporation of these impurities at perovskite crystal surfaces or formation of non-perovskite phase inclusions likely influence the perovskite layer morphology and properties which are investigated in Part II. These results reveal a new mechanism by which optoelectronic properties of perovskites can be chemically modified. Additionally, the general concept of acidification of organic molecules solvated to Pb 2+
promoting unexpected reactions is applied to explain amine reactions with other additives, such as formic acid. Understanding acid–base reactions induced by PbI 2
complexing to protic molecules is useful to comprehend and predict defect/impurity chemistry in a wide variety of perovskite precursor formulations.

Abstract Solvents employed for perovskite film fabrication not only play important roles in dissolving the precursors but also participate in crystallization process. High boiling point aprotic solvents with O-donor ligands have been extensively studied, but the formation of a highly uniform halide perovskite film still requires the participation of additives or an additional step to accelerate the nucleation rate. The volatile aliphatic methylamine with both coordinating ligands and hydrogen protons as solvent or post-healing gas facilitates the process of methylamine-based perovskite films with high crystallinity, few defects, and easy large-scale fabrication as well. However, the attempt in formamidinium-containing perovskites is challenged heretofore. Here, we reveal that the degradation of formamidinium-containing perovskites in aliphatic amines environment results from the transimination reaction of formamidinium cation and aliphatic amines along with the formation of ammonia. Based on this mechanism, ammonia is selected as a post-healing gas for a highly uniform, compact formamidinium-based perovskite films. In particular, low temperature is proved to be crucial to enable formamidinium-based perovskite materials to absorb enough ammonia molecules and form a liquid intermediate state which is the key to eliminating voids in raw films. As a result, the champion perovskite solar cell based on ammonia post-healing achieves a power conversion efficiency of 23.21% with excellent reproducibility. Especially the module power conversion efficiency with 14 cm 2
active area is over 20%. This ammonia post-healing treatment potentially makes it easier to upscale fabrication of highly efficient formamidinium-based devices.

Introduction Halide perovskite materials with the general formula ABX 3 , where A refers to a monovalent cation such as methylammonium (CH 3 NH 3 + , MA + ), formamidinium (HC(NH 2 ) 2 + , FA + ), Cs + , B represents a divalent cation such as Pb 2+ , Sn 2+ , Ge 2+ , and X represents a halide ion such as I - , Br - , Cl - , have emerged as a class of promising light-harvesting materials in photovoltaics since 2009 1 . The highest certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has so far been up to 25.7%
2 , which is comparable to that of widely commercialized Si-based solar cells. The crystal structure of halide perovskites can be regarded as a [MX 6 ] 4−
octahedron in a three-dimensional (3D) space with a common apex angle connecting. The A site ions fill up the gap of the octahedral and the structure is stabilized by Van der Waals forces 3 . These special structural characteristics provide a variety of solution processing methods to prepare perovskite films 4 , 5 , 6 . The high boiling point aprotic
N,N -dimethylformamide (DMF),
γ -butyrolactone (GBL), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and
N,N -dimethylacetamide (DMA) are the common solvents employed to dissolve the perovskite precursors with the formation of solvated iodoplumbate complexes because of the strong coordination between O-donor ligands (OLs) and Pb(II) 4 , 7 , 8 , 9 . The Lewis basicity of solvents is thought to correlate with the “coordinating ability” with lead halide salts, which can be predicted by their Gutmann’s Donor Number (D N ) with a trend of DMSO > DMA > DMF > GBL 10 , 11 . High D N
solvents with strong coordination with the Pb(II) center also result in the formation of intermediate phase OL-PbI 2 -RAI (RA refers to MA or FA, etc.) prior to perovskite phase during the film fabrication process. The anisotropic growth nature of the intermediate phase leads to rough films with one-dimensional (1D) fiber-like structures and a large proportion of void area 12 . In this regard, stronger coordinating additives (such as thiourea 13
and pyridine 14 ) and/or the fast nucleation strategies (such as anti-solvent extraction, gas-quenching, and vacuum-assisted drying) have been introduced to regulate the growth process of the intermediate phase to achieve highly uniform perovskite films with good crystallinity 7 , 15 , 16 . Among them, methylamine (MA 0 ) featured with the presence of hydrogen bonding and low boiling point has become an impressive coordination agent for the MAPbI 3
material. In this case, the formed intermediate phase is a metastable (PbI 2 -MAI)·xMA 0
complex, instead of simple coordinate bond-dominated OL-PbI 2 -MAI adducts. Easy formation of highly uniform (PbI 2 -MAI)·xMA 0
films and following conversion to highly uniform perovskite films are closely related to the self-leveling behavior of (PbI 2 -MAI)·xMA 0
liquid intermediate phase and the ultrafast evaporation of MA 0
gas. MA 0
employed as a post-healing gas to eliminate the voids in the MAPbI 3
perovskite film is firstly reported by Zhou et al. in 2015 17 , and the adoption of MA 0
as a volatile solvent system has become a commercially viable technology for MAPbI 3
devices with excellent device reproducibility 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 . In comparison with MAPbI 3 , α-FAPbI 3
has higher theoretical efficiency and thermal stability. The undesired phase transition to non-perovskite phase δ-FAPbI 3
has been well dissolved by alloying a small amount of Cs + , MA +
to tailor the tolerance factor 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 . We have attempted to introduce MA 0
gas-related methods for the fabrication of FA-containing perovskite layers, unfortunately, resulting in degradation of the 3D perovskite phase 18 . The underlying reason for the irreversible transformation of FAPbI 3
with MA 0
treatment is still not fully clear, let alone make efforts to solve this problem. Here, we have systematically studied the underlying chemical reactions between aliphatic amines/formamidine (FA 0 ) gases and FAI salt, and elucidated the addition-elimination reaction between amine compound and the imine band of FA 0
with the formation of ammonia (NH 3 ), also named transimination reaction. Based on this mechanism, NH 3
is selected as a post-healing gas to avoid the degradation of the FA-based perovskite phase during the post treatment. It is demonstrated that decreasing processing temperature is crucial for FA-based perovskite layer to enhance the absorption of NH 3
molecules, leading to the formation of a desired liquid intermediate state. Self-leveling behavior of the liquid intermediate state can quickly heal the voids in the rough perovskite film and finally form a highly uniform and compact film with the evaporation of NH 3 . At last, the PCE of FA-based PSC based on this NH 3
post-healing strategy is more than 23% with a certified PCE of 22.22%. Especially, the PSC module achieves a PCE of 20.61% which is comparable with the highest reports in PSC modules. These results demonstrate the large advantage of the NH 3
gas post-healing technology in upscaling fabrication of highly efficient PSCs. Results The degradation evidence of formamidinium-containing perovskites in aliphatic amines environment Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a particularly practical tool for quantifying the relative amounts of the organic cations and related chemical reactions in the perovskite precursor 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 . We started with the study of the underlying chemical reactions between FA 0 /R-NH 2 (RA 0 ) gases and FAI salt (Table  1 ). The gases involved include FA 0 , MA 0 , ethylamine (EA 0 ),
n -propylamine (PA 0 ),
n -butylamine (BA 0 ), and NH 3 . The detailed preparation procedures of the relevant gases are provided in the methods section. Table 1 The synthesis of formamidine (FA 0 ) and chemical reactions between FA 0 /amines/NH 3
gases and FAI salt Full size table The synthesis of FA 0
is tricky because of its instability. Mixed FACl and NaOH powders are expected to form FA 0
by the neutralization as shown in Supplementary Scheme  1a . To study their product, deuterated DMSO (DMSO-d 6 ) solvent is used to collect released gas from the mixed powders at room temperature (RT) by a simple equipment (Supplementary Fig.  1a ) for
1 H nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H NMR) measurement. Only NH 3
signal is detected in the
1 H NMR (Table  1
(No. 1) and Supplementary Fig.  4 ). We think that the high boiling point of FA 0
likely makes FA 0
molecules difficult to diffuse into DMSO-d 6
solvent. The formation of NH 3
is indicative of the existence of some chemical reactions in the process of gas preparation (Supplementary Fig.  2 ). When the temperature of the reactor and the gas pipeline is increased to 150 °C and DMSO-d 6
solvent is still kept at RT, four main compounds are detected:
s -triazine, formamide, FA 0 , and NH 3
(Table  1
(No. 2) and Supplementary Fig.  5 ). The formation of
s -triazine is because of the transimination reaction of three FA 0
molecules along with the formation of NH 3
(Supplementary Fig.  2b ) 30 , 31 . The
s -triazine has also been detected when the FAI powder is heated at 150 °C 32 . Formamide is attributed to the hydrolyzation product of FA 0
(Supplementary Fig.  2c ) in the presence of H 2 O which is generated from the neutralization between FACl and NaOH. Considering the long-time interval from gas collection to
1 H NMR measurement, we then employ acetic acid (HOAc) to capture FA 0
so as to limit these chemical reactions in DMSO-d 6
solvent by the quick formation of FAAc. As expected,
1 H NMR spectrum verifies that the reaction product at 150 °C only exists FAAc rather than
s -triazine, formamide, or NH 4 Ac (Table  1
(No. 3) and Supplementary Fig.  6 ). The above results strongly indicate the formation and instability of FA 0 . When FAI powder is exposed to FA 0 , there is hardly any change in chemical compositions except the formation of a tiny amount of formamide as the presence of H 2 O (Table  1
(No. 4), Supplementary Fig.  7 ). These spontaneous reactions and instability of FA 0
seriously limit its practical application in post-healing FA-based perovskite films. In comparison with FA 0 , amines are more stable. When FAI powder is treated with MA 0 , EA 0 , PA 0 , or BA 0 , the powder quickly transforms into a liquid state. After the liquid is held at 60 °C for 6 h and then vacuumed (Supplementary Fig.  1b ), it is unexpected that there are no FAI signals in
1 H NMR spectrum of the final powder samples (Table  1
(No. 5–8), Supplementary Figs.  8 – 11 ). Taking MA 0
as an example (Table  1
(No. 5)), we find that the main signals in
1 H NMR spectrum belong to
N,N ’-dimethyl formamidinium iodide (DMFAI) (Supplementary Figs.  3
and
8 ) 33 . The related chemical reactions are illustrated in Fig.  1 (i, ii) . The lone-pair electrons of N atom in nucleophilic MA 0
molecule can attack electrophilic imine bond in FAI, which leads to the formation of
N -methyl formamidinium iodide (MFAI) by a transimination process (Fig.  1(i) , Supplementary Fig.  3 ) 34 . The imine bond in the formed MFAI can carry out the second transimination reaction with MA 0
to form DMFAI (Fig.  1(ii) , Supplementary Fig.  3 ). With excessive MA 0
and holding for enough time, FAI can fully transform into DMFAI. Similarly, when FAI powders are treated with EA 0 , PA 0
and BA 0
gases, the transimination reaction also occur with the formation of DEFAI, DPFAI and DBFAI, respectively (Table  1
(No. 6–8), Supplementary Figs.  9 – 11 , Fig.  1(i, ii) ). Fig. 1: Chemical reactions related to FAI. The transimination reactions and the ion exchange reactions between FAI and RA 0
molecules (R refers to H, Me, Et,
n -Pr, or
n -Bu etc.), and the hydrolysis reactions of FA 0 , RFA 0 , and DRFA 0 . Full size image When FAI powder is treated by RA 0
(R is referred to H, Me, Et etc.) gas with some H 2 O vapor evaporated from their aqueous solution (Supplementary Fig.  1c ), the final product is RAI rather than FAI, RFAI or DRFAI (Table  1
(No. 9–11), Supplementary Figs.  12 – 14 ). Considering there is no reaction between FAI salt and H 2 O (Table  1
(No. 12), Supplementary Fig.  15 ), the formation of RAI mentioned above is due to the reversible ion exchange reactions between FAI, RFAI or DRFAI and RA 0
with the formation of RAI and FA 0 , RFA 0 , or DRFA 0 . The hydrolysis reactions of FA 0 , RFA 0 , and DRFA 0
lead to the formation of volatile HCOOH and RA 0 , which in turn promotes the ion exchange reactions towards the formation of RAI (Fig.  1 (iii–x) ) 35 . Supplementary Fig.  16
shows the optical photos and XRD patterns of α-FAPbI 3
films before and after MA 0
post-healing treatment. δ-FAPbI 3 , MFAPbI 3 , and DMFAPbI 3
films are also measured for comparison. The formation of the non-perovskite phase after MA 0
post-healing the α-FAPbI 3
film is because of the conversion from FA +
to MFA +
and DMFA + . This is why aliphatic amines cannot be employed as solvents or post-healing gases for the fabrication of FA-containing perovskite materials. Inspired by the above transimination reaction, NH 3
is selected to avoid the change of composition after the gas post-healing treatment. The
1 H NMR spectrum well verifies no composition change of FAI powder after being treated with NH 3
gas (Table  1
(No. 13), Supplementary Fig.  17 ). Feasibility analysis of ammonia as the healing gas The reversible absorption-desorption process of gas is crucial for the post-healing strategy. MAI and FAI samples are weighted during MA 0 /NH 3
absorption and desorption as shown in Fig.  2a . The whole process can be divided into gas absorption at RT (Stage I), desorption at RT (Stage II), and desorption at 80 °C (Stage III). When exposed to MA 0 , MAI quickly absorbs MA 0  and reaches a saturated state with the
x
value of about 2.5 in MAI·xMA 0
(the
x
value is very sensitive to temperature and pressure). The liquid MAI·xMA 0
complex removed from MA 0
atmosphere desorbs MA 0
gas spontaneously until it transforms into a relative stable semi-solid-state with the
x
value of about 1.1, which is denoted as stage II. After further heating at 80 °C for 10 min (Stage III), the sample returns to a white powder with the same weight as the initial MAI, which means the complete reversibility of absorption-desorption process in MAI-MA 0
pair. In FAI-MA 0
pair, the Stage I and Stage II are similar to these of MAI-MA 0
pair, but the weight of the final powder in the Stage III cannot return back to the initial value of FAI because of the formation of MFAI and DMFAI as presented in Fig.  2a . Fig. 2: The interaction of NH 3

∼ 3.0 (Stage I). The liquid phase transforms into an ice-like transparent solid-state FAI·xNH 3
with
x
∼
1.3 as NH 3
desorption in Stage II and the XRD pattern of the ice-like complex is shown in Supplementary Fig.  17 . The following thermal annealing at 80 °C fully removes the absorbed NH 3
molecules and leads to the formation of a white powder with the same weight as the initial FAI (Stage III). This phenomenon, similar to that of MAI-MA 0
pair, preliminarily indicates the feasibility of the NH 3
as a post-healing gas for FA-based perovskite films. To make a profound study, the chemical reaction and intermolecular interactions between FAPbI 3
precursors and NH 3
molecules, the solution
15 N NMR spectra are measured as shown in Fig.  2b
and Supplementary Figs.  19 – 24 . The measured isotopically labeled
15 N samples are
15 NH 3 , FAI treated with
15 NH 3 , and vacuumed (FAI( 15 N)), FAI absorbing
15 NH 3
molecules (FAI·x 15 NH 3 ), PbI 2
absorbing
15 NH 3
molecules (PbI 2 ·x 15 NH 3 ), and FAPbI 3
absorbing
15 NH 3
molecules (FAPbI 3 ·x 15 NH 3 ). The
15 N chemical shift of
15 NH 3
in DMSO-d 6
is −377.46 ppm. The
15 N NMR spectrum of FAI after treatment with
15 NH 3
(FAI ( 15 N)) shows the
15 N signal at −356.33 ppm, which indicates the existence of transimination reaction between NH 3
and FAI (Supplementary Fig.  3 ). The reaction process between the NH 3
and FAI is similar to the transimination reaction involving the aliphatic amine. The lone-pair electrons of N atom in NH 3
can attack electrophilic imine bond in FAI, leading to the exchange of
15 N in NH 3
and
14 N in FAI and formation of FAI( 15 N), as shown in Fig.  2c . Besides, the
15 N chemical shift of FAI in FAI ·x 15 NH 3
is at −265.22 ppm, which moves towards the low field about 91 ppm in comparison with FAI( 15 N). It suggests the presence of hydrogen bond interaction between NH 3
and FAI. Furthermore, the
15 N chemical shift of PbI 2 ·x 15 NH 3
at −357.51 ppm moves towards the low field about 20 ppm compared to that of
15 NH 3 , which is due to the coordination of
15 NH 3
to Pb(II). The
15 N chemical shifts of FAPbI 3 ·x 15 NH 3
at −265.02 ppm and −357.53 ppm correspond to that of FA + ( 15 N) with hydrogen bond interaction with NH 3
and that of
15 NH 3
with coordination bond interaction with Pb(II), respectively. The coexistence of hydrogen bond and coordination bond in the intermediate phase FAPbI 3 ·x 15 NH 3
is also supported by the solid-state
15 N NMR result in Supplementary Fig.  25 . NH 3 , employed as a post-healing gas, should also have good solubility for the FA-based perovskite precursors, including PbI 2
and FAI powders. The color of mixed PbI 2 /FAI powder exposed in NH 3
gas atmosphere turns into light yellow from the yellow of PbI 2
at 20 °C 36 . The mass difference before and after absorption shows that the absorbed NH 3
molecule number per FAPbI 3
is
∼ 4. While FAPbI 3 ·4NH 3
is still a solid-state rather than an expected liquid state, which is very different from liquid MAPbI 3 ·xMA with x of only 3 17 . One possible reason is the much smaller size of NH 3
than MA 0 . We have found that the absorbed amount of gas is highly dependent on processing temperature 23 . Lowering the processing temperature to −5 °C leads to the formation of a white powder with
x
value of
∼ 6. At −15 °C, a flowable slurry with the
x
value of
∼ 12 is formed, as shown in Fig.
2d . The kinetic process of NH 3
desorption from the flowable FAPbI 3 ·xNH 3
complex is measured by monitoring its weight change with temperature increased step-by-step from 20 °C to 120 °C under an open condition. The absorbing NH 3
number per FAPbI 3
as the function of time illustrated in Fig.  2e
shows that the weight of FAPbI 3 ·xNH 3
slurry drops rapidly at the initial stage and then decreases slowly in 30 min at 20 °C. Then the sample was annealed at 40 °C for 30 min and 60 °C for 30 min showing continuously slow weight loss by weighing at regular intervals. At 80 °C, the sample quickly reaches a relatively stable state then almost no weight loss in the maintained 30 min and the NH 3
molecular number per FAPbI 3
is about 1.0. Finally, the
x
value quickly decreases to 0 when the sample is annealed at 120 C. Preparation and characterization of thin films Then the NH 3
post-healing strategy is employed to prepare FA-based perovskite films based on a homemade chamber with a semiconductor chilling plate controlling chamber temperature (Supplementary Fig.  26 ). As shown in Supplementary Fig.  27a, b , the raw FAPbI 3
film with voids by the traditional one-step spin-coating method can transform into a uniform film after NH 3
post-healing at −15  °C. The NH 3
post-healing FAPbI 3
is denoted as NH 3 -FAPbI 3 . The XRD spectra show that the NH 3 -FAPbI 3
film has better crystallinity and less undesired δ phase than the raw film (Supplementary Fig.  27c ). This leads to the increasing PCE of the NH 3 -FAPbI 3
device compared to the raw-FAPbI 3
device (Supplementary Fig.  27d ). While the PCE of NH 3 -FAPbI 3
device is still limited due to the existence of undesired δ-phase in the perovskite film. To prepare highly efficient PSCs, cesium (Cs) doped FAPbI 3
material system FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3
(FACsPbI 3 ) is selected. The NH 3
post-healing process of FACsPbI 3
film is schematically illustrated in Fig.  3a . Due to the thin thickness of perovskite films, the NH 3
gas absorption and desorption are much easier and faster than those of powder samples. The SEM images show that the raw FACsPbI 3
film could be well healed by the NH 3
post-healing method in the temperature range from −15 °C to 0 °C, and −15  °C was used for NH 3
gas post-healing in the following study (Supplementary Fig.  28 ). Fig. 3: Properties of perovskite Films. a

Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectra and steady photoluminescence (PL) spectra of raw FACsPbI 3
and NH 3 -FACsPbI 3
perovskite films, respectively. Full size image The scanning electron microscope (SEM) image (Fig.  3b ) shows that there are some micrometer-scale voids in the raw FACsPbI 3
film. While the NH 3 -FACsPbI 3
film is dense and smooth (Fig.  3c ), resulting from the self-leveling of the liquid intermediate state and the quick desorbing process of the NH 3 . This gas post-healing treatment with the self-leveling behavior is essentially different from the traditional post-treatment using DMF 37 , MASCN vapor 25 , etc. The corresponding atomic force microscope (AFM) images (Supplementary Fig.  29 ) show that the root mean square (RMS) roughness of NH 3 -FACsPbI 3
film is only 9 nm over a 20 × 20 µm 2
area, which is even lower than that of the film prepared by the traditional antisolvent method (24 nm) (denoted as anti-FACsPbI 3 ). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns in Fig.  3d
and e show that the NH 3
post-healing strategy can improve the orientation of the perovskite film, and the diffraction intensity of (110) peak of the NH 3 -FACsPbI 3
perovskite film is about 100 times stronger than that of the raw FACsPbI 3
perovskite film. Besides, NH 3
post-healing decreases the full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of the (110) peak from 0.203 o
to 0.114 o
(Fig.  3e ). As shown in ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) optical absorption spectra (Fig.  3f ) and their Tauc plot curves (Supplementary Fig.  30 ), the raw and NH 3 -FACsPbI 3
perovskite films present almost the same absorption edge and band gap of 1.54 eV. While the absorbance of NH 3 -FACsPbI 3
perovskite film exhibits an obvious increase compared to that of raw perovskite film, resulting from the removal of voids. Photoluminescence (PL) peak of the NH 3 -FACsPbI 3
film is similar to that of the anti-FACsPbI 3
film (Supplementary Fig.  31 ), but obviously blue shift and narrow in comparison with the raw FACsPbI 3
film, which indicates a low trap density of NH 3 -FACsPbI 3
and anti-FACsPbI 3
films in comparison with the raw film 38 . The reduced defect density is also evidenced by the charge-limited current (SCLC) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) results in Supplementary Fig.  32 . The calculated defect density from the SCLC curves decreases from 3.97 × 10 16
to 9.62 × 10 15  cm −3 . And the TRPL results show that the NH 3 -FACsPbI 3
film has a much longer trap-assisted nonradiative lifetime (τ = 5.6 μs) than the Raw FACsPbI 3
film (τ = 3.2 μs). Device performance evaluation The planar devices with a configuration of FTO/TiO 2 -SnO 2 /perovskite/2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis( N,N -di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)−9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD)/Au are fabricated. The champion solar cell (Fig.  4a ) based on NH 3 -FACsPbI 3
film displays a PCE of 23.21%, with open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 1.16 V, short-circuit current density ( J SC ) of 24.65 mA/cm 2 , fill factor (FF) of 81.20%, demonstrating obvious improvement in comparison with the PCE of 10.92% of the control device based on raw FACsPbI 3
film and comparable performance compared to the devices (PCE = 22.99%) based on the anti-FACsPbI 3
film in our lab (Supplementary Fig.  33 ). The certified PCE of NH 3 -FACsPbI 3
PSC is 22.22% (Supplementary Fig.  34 ). Meanwhile, there is less hysteresis for the NH 3 -FACsPbI 3
device (Supplementary Fig.  35 ). The stabilized power output (SPO) of NH 3 -FACsPbI 3
champion cells is 22.93%, shown in Supplementary Fig.  36 . The
J SC
of NH 3 -FACsPbI 3
PSC is comparable with the integrated
J SC
from EQE results (24.41 mA/cm 2 ) in Fig.  4b . The distribution histogram of PCE based on 50 NH 3 -FACsPbI 3
devices at reverse scan direction (Fig.  4c , Supplementary Table  1 ) shows excellent reproducibility of high-performance NH 3
post-healing devices. The cross-sectional SEM image of NH 3 -FACsPbI 3
PSC shows the uniform thickness and good interfacial contact of perovskite film with transport layers (Supplementary Fig.  37 ). Combined NH 3
gas healing and the doctor-blading technology (Suzhou GCL Nano Co. Ltd.), a prototype PSC module consisting 10 cells in series connection achieves a PCE of 20.61% (Fig.  4d ) and the certified PCE of the module is 19.38% (Supplementary Fig.  38 ) with an estimated active area of 14.00 cm 2 , which is comparable with the reported highest efficiencies in perovskite modules 39 , 40 , 41 .

and anti-MAPbI 3
devices under light soaking with full solar intensity. Standard deviation (error bar) was calculated from three individual devices in the same batch. Full size image To further evaluate the device stability based on NH 3
post-healing treatment, the high-efficiency NH 3 -FACsPbI 3 , anti-FACsPbI 3 , anti-FA 0.90 Cs 0.05 MA 0.05 PbI 3
(anti-FMCsPbI 3 ), and anti-MAPbI 3
PSCs are employed. As the low PCE, raw FACsPbI 3
device has not been chosen to study its stability. The shelf stability of unencapsulated devices in Fig.  4e
shows that NH 3 -FACsPbI 3
device has negligible performance loss after 320 days of storage, which is similar to the anti-FACsPbI 3
devices and much better than anti-FMCsPbI 3
and anti-MAPbI 3 . The XRD and UV-Vis spectra of these aged perovskite films in 320-day-aged PSCs (Supplementary Figs.  39 – 41 ) show that NH 3 -FACsPbI 3
film keeps its strong light absorption, and has few PbI 2 . Meanwhile, NH 3 -FACsPbI 3
device still maintains decent cross-sectional morphology with clear grain boundaries (Supplementary Fig.  42 ). What’s more, the maximum power point (MPP) of the unencapsulated NH 3 -FACsPbI 3 , anti-FACsPbI 3 , anti-FMCsPbI 3,
and anti-MAPbI 3
PSCs is tracked under white light emitting diode (LED) irradiation (Fig.  4f , Supplementary Fig.  43 ) with an intensity equivalent to 1 sun in N 2
atmosphere. After 500 h of continuous light soaking, the NH 3 -FACsPbI 3
device maintains 80% of its initial efficiency, and the stability trend of MPP tracking is consistent with that of shelf stability in these devices. Discussion We have systematically studied the transimination reactions between FA/RA gases and FAI salt, and further developed an NH 3
gas post-healing strategy for upscale fabrication of high-quality FA-based perovskite films. The low operating temperature during NH 3
post-healing process is vital to enable FA-based perovskite materials to absorb enough NH 3
molecules and transform into a flowable intermediate state. Based on this strategy, the champion device achieves a PCE of 23.21% (Certified PCE of 22.22%), and the PCE of the perovskite module is up to 20.61%. Meanwhile, the device stability based on this strategy is also comparable with that of the state-of-the-art anti-solvent method. This NH 3
gas post-healing technology is compatible with established commercial technologies to efficiently remove voids in the raw FA-based films and therefore opens a direction for fabrication of large-scale high-efficient FA-based PSCs. Methods Materials N,N -dimethylformamide (DMF, anhydrous 99.8%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, anhydrous 99.9%) were procured from Sigma-Aldrich. Formamidine hydrochloride (FACl, 96%), Ethylamine Hydrochloride (EACl, 98%),

Formamidinium iodide (FAI, 99.5%), Methanaminium iodine (MAI, 99.5%), Cesium iodide (CsI, 99.99%), and Spiro-OMeTAD (99.8%) were purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp. (PLT). Ammonium chloride ( 15 NH 4 Cl, 10 atom%
15 N labelled, ≥98.5%) was purchased from Macklin. Ammonium chloride ( 15 NH 4 Cl, 99 atom%
15 N labelled, >98%) and DMSO-d 6
(99 atom% D labelled) were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. (CIL). Sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 96%), Methylamine alcohol solution (30–33 wt. % in anhydrous ethanol), and Ammonium Hydroxide (NH 3  ∙ H 2 O, 25 ∼ 28%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. The above chemicals were used as received without any purification. Material synthesis For the synthesis of N-methyl formamidinium iodide (MFAI), Methylamine alcohol solution (30–33 wt. % in anhydrous ethanol, 425 μl, about 2.8 mmol) was added dropwise to a solution of formamidinium iodide (FAI, 516 mg, 3 mmol) in 30 ml anhydrous ethanol under nitrogen protection, and the mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue was recrystallized in the mix solvent of isopropanol and ethyl acetate in glove box to obtain the MFAI powder. The synthesis of N, N’-dimethyl formamidinium iodide (DMFAI) was similar to that of MFAI, but the amount of the methylamine alcohol solution was increased to 1 ml. NMR sample fabrication For solution
1 H NMR characterization of the sample in Table  1
(No.1), the mixture of 5.0 g FACl and 5.0 g NaOH was reacted at RT in a conical flask, and the generated gas was collected by 0.5 ml DMSO-d 6 . For samples in Table  1
(No. 2–4), the mixture of 5.0 g FACl and 5.0 g NaOH was reacted at 150 °C, and the generated gas was collected by 0.5 ml DMSO-d 6 , 1 ml HOAc or 0.2 g FAI powder at RT. Samples No. 3 and 4 were vacuumed before dissolving in DMSO-d 6 . For samples in Table  1
(No. 5–12), the gas sources of R-NH 2
were heated at 60 °C, and the generated gases were collected by 0.2 g FAI powder. The gas sources of R-NH 2
were methylamine alcohol solution, the mixture of EACl and NaOH, PA, BA, NH 3 ·H 2 O, MA aqueous solution, EA aqueous solution, or H 2 O, respectively. The samples (No. 5–12) were kept at 60 °C for 6 h, and then vacuum treated to remove the low boiling point components. For the sample in Table  1
(No. 13), the NH 3
gas was collected with 0.2 g FAI powder. The sample was kept at RT for 6 h and then vacuumed. The obtained solid powders in Table  1
(No. 3–13) were dissolved in DMSO-d 6
for
1 H NMR characterization. For solution
15 N NMR characterization,
15 NH 3
was produced from the reaction between 5.0 g
15 NH 4 Cl (10%
15 N labelled) and 5.0 g NaOH at 60 °C, and the generated gas was collected by 0.5 ml DMSO-d 6 . FAI ( 15 N) was produced based on the reaction between 0.2 g FAI and excess
15 NH 3
at RT for 6 h, followed by vacuum treatment. FAI·x 15 NH 3 , PbI 2 ·x 15 NH 3 , and FAPbI 3 ·x 15 NH 3
were generated between the reaction between 0.2 g FAI, 0.2 g PbI 2 , or 0.2 g FAPbI 3
precursor powders and excess
15 NH 3
at RT for 6 h, but without vacuum treatment. The above samples were directly dissolved in DMSO-d 6
for
15 N NMR measurement. The NMR sample fabrication of FAPbI 3 ·x 15 NH 3
for the solid-state NMR spectrum was similar to that of the solution
15 N NMR spectrum, but
15 N isotope source for preparing
15 NH 3
was used
15 NH 4 Cl (99%
15 N labelled) as the requirement of high
15 N concentration for solid-state NMR. NMR measurements The solution
1 H NMR spectra were measured with a Bruker AVANCE III 600 instrument operating at 600.13 MHz at 298 K. Chemical shifts d (ppm) were referenced to the internal solvent signals. The solution
1 H-decoupled
15 N NMR spectra (pules program zgig) were acquired using a Bruker Avance III 600 instrument operating at 600.13 MHz for
1 H and 60.82 MHz for
15 N. The
15 N chemical shifts were determined from 1 M urea in DMSO (−303.20 ppm, 10%
15 N labelled) as external standard reference
42 . The relaxation delay was 10 s, the acquisition time was 1.3 s, and 128 scans were accumulated. The solid-state NMR experiment was performed on a Bruker AVNCE 400 spectrometer operating at 399.95 MHz for
1 H and 40.54 MHz for
15 N. The obtained sample was packed into a 7 mm ZrO 2
rotor. The
15 N chemical shifts were determined from the
15 NH 4 Cl (−341.17 ppm, 10%
15 N labelled) 43 . The HPEDC pulse sequence was used. The acquisition time was 50 ms, the spin rate was 3 kHz, and the recycle delay was 5 s. The two-pulse phase-modulation (TPPM) decoupling was used during the acquisition. Perovskite film fabrication Raw FACsPbI 3
films: The perovskite precursor was prepared by mixing PbI 2 : FAI: CsI (1:0.9:0.1 molar ratio) in DMF solvent (1.40 M). Raw FAPbI 3
films: The perovskite precursor was prepared by mixing PbI 2 : FAI (1:1 molar ratio) in DMF solvent (1.40 M). The raw FACsPbI 3
and FAPbI 3
films were simply fabricated by one-step spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 30 s and then heated at 140 °C for 20 min. NH 3 -FACsPbI 3
film: After spin-coating, the raw FACsPbI 3
film was annealed at 140 °C for 5 min, and then transferred into a homemade chamber with a temperature from 20 to −15 °C. N 2
gas was used to remove the moisture-laden air in the chamber. Subsequently, NH 3
gas was quickly introduced into the chamber and maintained for
∼ 5 s. Then the NH 3
gas is removed from the chamber and the film was further annealed at 140 °C for 20 min. For NH 3 -FAPbI 3
film, the film treatment process is the same as above, and the temperature of the homemade chamber is −15 °C for NH 3
post-healing process. For anti-FACsPbI 3 , anti-FMCsPbI 3 , and anti-MAPbI 3
films, the perovskite precursors were prepared in DMF: DMSO (3:7, 1.40 M) by stoichiometric ratios. The perovskite solution was spin-coated in a two-step at 1000 rpm and 4000 rpm for 10 s and 30 s, respectively. During the second step, 300 μl anisole was drop-casted quickly at the tenth second of the second step. The anti-MAPbI 3
perovskite film was then heated at 100 °C for 20 min, and the other films were heated at 140 °C for 20 min. The α-FAPbI 3 , δ-FAPbI 3 , MFAPbI 3 , and DMFAPbI 3
films were fabricated from their DMF solution with a concentration of 1.40 M using chlorobenzene as the antisolvent. The α-FAPbI 3 , MFAPbI 3 , and DMFAPbI 3
films were obtained after heating treatment at 140 °C for 20 min. The δ-FAPbI 3
film was achieved by exposing α-FAPbI 3
film in the air (RH > 50%) until fully transformed into yellow. The MA-FAPbI 3
film was prepared by the MA 0
gas post-healing the α-FAPbI 3
film and then heated at 140 °C for 20 min. The annealing process of all thin films is in ambient air conditions (30–40% humidity). Device fabrication The methods described are similar to that reference
44 . Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass (2.20 mm, 7Ω sq −1 ) was used as the substrate for the devices. The compact TiO 2
layer ( ∼ 10 nm) was deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) for 200 cycles and annealed at 500 °C for 30 min in ambient air. For ALD TiO 2
deposition, titanium (IV) isopropoxide (TTIP) and H 2 O as Ti and O sources, respectively. The TTIP precursor was held at 75 °C. Pulse/exposure/purge times of 1 s/8 s/25 s were used for the TTIP and 0.1 s/8 s/25 s for H 2 O precursor, and the deposition temperature was set to 120 °C. On top of the c-TiO 2
layer, SnO x -Cl layer was deposited by spin-coating at a speed of 3000 rpm for 30 s from an aged SnCl 4
aqueous solution (1:75 with deionized water by volume), followed by a sintering heat-treatment of 200 °C for 30 min in air and then transferred to the glove box for device fabrication. The perovskite layers were fabricated as described above. For the surface passivation, 1 mg ml −1
of Phenyltrimethylammonium tribromide (PTAB) solution in isopropanol was spin-coated on these perovskite films at 4000 rpm for 30 s. The spiro-OMeTAD chlorobenzene solution (72.3 mg ml −1 ) with 28.8 μl 4-tert-butylpyridine (96%, Aldrich-Sigma) and 17.5 μl lithium bis(trifluoro-methanesulfonyl) imide (Li-TSFI, Aldrich-Sigma) solution (520 mg Li-TSFI (98%) in 1 ml acetonitrile (99.8%, Aldrich-Sigma)) was spin-coated on top of the perovskite film at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The devices were put into a dry-air box (RH < 3%) for 12 h. Finally, 80 nm thick Au electrode was thermally evaporated. For fabricating modules, P1 etching process was pre-patterned on FTO glass (5 cm × 5 cm) with a 1064 nm fiber laser (Han’s laser). The laser power ratio, laser duty cycle, and laser frequency were 30%, 5%, and 50 kHz, respectively. Then, patterned FTO substrates were cleaned and treated by UV Ozone Cleaner (Ossila) for 15 min. The TiO 2 /SnO 2 , PTAB, and Spiro-OMeTAD layers were prepared with the same procedure as presented above. The large-size raw FACsPbI 3
perovskite film was prepared through the doctor-blading method (provided by Suzhou GCL Nano Co. Ltd.). The NH 3
post-healing strategy was carried out on it to form a large-scale NH 3 -FACsPbI 3
film. For P2 etching process, the laser used was a 532 nm laser with a laser power ratio of 65%, a laser duty cycle of 5%, and a laser frequency of 100 kHz. 80 nm thick Au electrodes were thermally evaporated under vacuum to complete the modules fabrication. Finally, P3 etching used the same laser with P2 with a laser power ratio of 50%, a laser duty cycle of 5%, and a laser frequency of 100 kHz. P4 is an etching procedure for cleaning the edge of the modules, the laser used in P4 is the same with P1 with a laser power ratio of 40%, the laser duty cycle of 10%, and a laser frequency of 100 kHz. Perovskite film and device characterization The characterization described are similar to that reference
44 . XRD spectra were measured by Ultima IV of Rigaku with Cu Kα radiation (1.5406 Å). The UV-Vis absorbance spectra were measured by QE Pro (Ocean Optics). Top view, cross-section SEM images were obtained with a field-emission SEM (S-4800, Hitachi). Steady PL spectra were recorded on QE Pro excited at 460 nm. AFM measurements were performed in contact mode (5400, Agilent). EQE measurement was calculated using certified incident photon to current conversion efficiency equipment from Enlitech (QE-R). Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) experiments were performed by Steady State and Transient State Fluorescence Spectrometer (Edinburgh FLS980). The testing conditions as the films were photoexcited at 483.6 nm pulse width
∼
118.6 ps, 5 mW/pulse, and emission were collected on the surface side of the film (perovskite/ glass substrate). J-V
curves of the as-fabricated PSCs were measured using a SourceMeter (Keithley 2400) under simulated one-sun AM 1.5 G 100 mW cm −2
intensity (Oriel Sol3A Class AAA, Newport) with a scan rate of 200 mV/s (the voltage step is 20 mV with no delay time) from reverse and forward two scanning directions in air condition around 25 °C. The typical active area of PSCs is 0.09 cm 2
defined by a metal mask. The area of the mask (0.08713 cm 2 ) used for certification was certified by the National Institute of Metrology, China, No. CDjc2021-10891. The intensity of one-sun AM 1.5 G illumination was calibrated using a Si-reference cell certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. SPO is measured by tracking the current under a fixed voltage which is decided by the voltage of maximum power point at the
J-V
curve. Here, the fixed voltage of NH 3 -FACsPbI 3
device is 1.002 V. For the stability tests, all PSCs were without encapsulation. For shelf-life stability, the devices were stored in a dark environment with a humidity of 10–30%, and the photovoltaic performance of PSCs was measured every ten days. The operational stability was performed using a stability setup (LC Auto-Test 24, Shenzhen Lancheng Technology Co., Ltd.), tested under continuous light illumination and maximum power point tracking (controlled and monitored to be 15 °C). The light source consisted of an array of white LEDs powered by a constant current. The LED type is MG-A200A-AE with an emission spectrum of 400–750 nm (Supplementary Fig.  40 ). Equivalent sun intensities were calibrated using a calibrated Si-reference cell. During aging, the device is connected with a 100 Ohm load resistance. The PSCs were masked and placed inside a sample holder purged with continuous N 2
flow.
J-V
curves with reverse voltage scans were recorded every 12 h during the whole operational test. Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the  Nature Research Reporting Summary

Abstract Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with an inverted structure (often referred to as the p–i–n architecture) are attractive for future commercialization owing to their easily scalable fabrication, reliable operation and compatibility with a wide range of perovskite-based tandem device architectures 1 , 2 . However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of p–i–n PSCs falls behind that of n–i–p (or normal) structure counterparts 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 . This large performance gap could undermine efforts to adopt p–i–n architectures, despite their other advantages. Given the remarkable advances in perovskite bulk materials optimization over the past decade, interface engineering has become the most important strategy to push PSC performance to its limit 7 , 8 . Here we report a reactive surface engineering approach based on a simple post-growth treatment of 3-(aminomethyl)pyridine (3-APy) on top of a perovskite thin film. First, the 3-APy molecule selectively reacts with surface formamidinium ions, reducing perovskite surface roughness and surface potential fluctuations associated with surface steps and terraces. Second, the reaction product on the perovskite surface decreases the formation energy of charged iodine vacancies, leading to effective n-type doping with a reduced work function in the surface region. With this reactive surface engineering, the resulting p–i–n PSCs obtained a PCE of over 25 per cent, along with retaining 87 per cent of the initial PCE after over 2,400 hours of 1-sun operation at about 55 degrees Celsius in air.

Main During the past decade, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been widely studied as a promising alternative photovoltaic technology 6 . Although the perovskite composition is still undergoing fine-tuning and improvement for specific applications, the perovskite field has accumulated various processing strategies for optimizing perovskite bulk materials, including their structure, crystallinity, defects and other optoelectronic properties 9 , 10 , 11 . As a result, interface and surface modification has become vitally important to ensure further advances in the areas of charge extraction, interface recombination and device stability 7 , 8 , 12 , 13 . At present, the record single-junction PSC efficiencies are all based on n–i–p architectures, which are associated with the optimized electron transport layer (ETL) and perovskite absorber layer 8 , 14 . However, the standard doped hole transport layer (HTL) in the n–i–p structure presents a challenge for simultaneously achieving both high efficiency and excellent operational reliability. The p–i–n cell structure represents an attractive option for PSC commercialization owing to its low-temperature processing and compatibility with large-scale fabrication 15 , 16 . Much progress on long-term operation has been reported for p–i–n PSCs 1 . Moreover, the p–i–n-structure-based perovskite tandem solar cells have demonstrated efficiencies surpassing those of single-junction PSCs 2 , 17 , 18 . Despite these attractive features, the performance of single-junction p–i–n PSCs has historically fallen behind that of n–i–p PSCs 19 . The performance of p–i–n devices has seen clear improvement in recent years, mainly owing to strategies to improve perovskite quality and interfacial properties 3 , 4 , 5 , 13 . However, the performance gap is still large, and significant efforts are required to accelerate p–i–n PSC development to its full potential for various applications. PSCs have two critical junctions at the perovskite/ETL and perovskite/HTL interfaces, and their quality has been correlated with device performance, including power conversion efficiency (PCE), photocurrent density–voltage ( J – V ) hysteresis, and stability and reliability 20 , 21 , 22 . Thus, realizing high-quality junctions is key to achieving high PSC performance. During perovskite-film processing, the top-surface region is prone to defect formation owing to easier escape of volatile species such as organic molecules and iodine; thus, top-surface engineering is particularly important to push p–i–n PSCs to a new level. An ideal surface engineering approach for p–i–n PSCs should: (1) not negatively affect the bulk quality of the perovskite film; (2) not produce materials hindering charge transfer; (3) reduce the density of unwanted defects; and/or (4) have a surface region that creates a built-in electric field, ensuring effective electron extraction and reducing carrier recombination. Here we demonstrate that a simple reactive surface engineering approach using the organic amine small-molecule 3-(aminomethyl)pyridine (3-APy, where Py denotes pyridine) can achieve these outcomes and, consequently, improve all photovoltaic parameters for p–i–n cells, amounting to a PCE greater than 25% as well as good operational stability, that is, retaining 87% of the initial PCE for over 2,400 h at about 55 °C. Surface reaction We first explain our design strategy of selecting 3-APy for surface treatment. Creating a built-in electric field in the surface region represents a promising approach for minimizing surface recombination and enhancing charge extraction. As good perovskite absorbers typically exhibit weak p-type conductivity or intrinsic nature, generating iodine vacancies, which are shallow donors, in the surface region is a preferred method to create the built-in electric field. The formation of a positively charged iodine vacancy (V I ) can be promoted by introducing a molecule with a negatively charged Py ring owing to their electrostatic attraction. To allow for the incorporation of the molecule without significantly perturbing the lattice in the surface region, it is better for the molecule to contain a formamidinium (FA) unit as its head. This will allow the FA unit to be incorporated into the A site of the lattice, displaying no barrier for charge transfer. In addition, the Py-ring unit will be left outside to promote the formation of a V I
nearby. 3-APy is a good candidate for this purpose. It has been shown that organic amine small molecules can react with FA 1+ cations to form bulkier amidinium 1+ cations. For example, methylamine readily reacts with a FA 1+ cation, forming a
N -methylformamidinium 1+ cation and releasing an ammonia (NH 3 ) molecule 23 . 3-APy contains both a Py ring and an amine group, and is expected to react with FA 1+ to form a 1+ cation composed of an ‘FA cation unit’ with an attached Py ring. The reaction is depicted in Fig.
1a , where the surface FA +
reacts with 3-APy, forming MPyFA +
( N -(3-methylpyridine)formamidinium) and releasing NH 3 . Indeed, density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed a reaction energy of 0.72 eV, supporting a spontaneous (thermodynamically favourable) reaction. We also experimentally verified this reaction, as discussed in Supplementary Note  1 . Fig. 1: Surface reaction, topography and potential. a , Condensation reaction scheme of FA +

e – g , AFM ( e ), KPFM ( f ) and line profile comparison ( g ) for the perovskite film with 3-APy surface treatment. It is noted that the KPFM images were flattened by subtracting a constant baseline potential (−2.4 V for the untreated sample and −1.7 V for the treated sample) for a better comparison of the potential variations. Full size image We now describe the effect of 3-APy treatment of the perovskite surface, the composition of which is Rb 0.05 Cs 0.05 MA 0.05 FA 0.85 Pb[I 0.95 Br 0.05 ] 3 , where MA is methylammonium. The 3-APy solution was applied to the perovskite surface by spin-coating. We conducted atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) to examine the impact of 3-APy treatment on the surface topography and potential distribution. Figure
1b
shows that for the control sample, the perovskite surface consists of clear steps (or terraced edges), which are normally an indication of highly crystalline perovskite 7 , 12 , 24 . However, the corresponding surface potential map shows that the steps cause strong potential fluctuations (Fig.
1c ). It is worth noting that various surface defects can modify the potential distribution of the perovskite surface 25 . Figure
1d
compares the line scan of the topography and surface potential variations from a typical perovskite region, as shown in Fig.
1b,c . These potential fluctuations can be up to about 50–100 mV over a length scale of about 10–20 nm. The steps on the perovskite surface are also probably more active/reactive and effective surface defects able to cause variations in local surface charge. In contrast, the 3-APy treatment drastically smoothed out these steps and suppressed the surface potential variations (Fig.
1e–g ; more comparison in Supplementary Fig.
7 ). The reaction-induced ‘polishing’ effect is also verified by scanning electron microscopy images (Supplementary Fig.
8 )—the perovskite surface without 3-APy treatment shows obviously terraced structures, whereas the 3-APy treatment shows a much smoother surface, which is consistent with the topography results observed in Fig.
1a,d . This reactive surface engineering approach showed negligible impact on X-ray diffraction (Supplementary Fig.
9 ) and ultraviolet–visible absorption (Supplementary Fig.
10 ), consistent with the 3-APy treatment being primarily a surface modification. A smoother, less defective surface is expected to be beneficial for improving the perovskite/ETL main junction 26 , 27 . Interfacial properties More importantly, we found that the 3-APy treatment can modify the energetics of the perovskite surface, creating a built-in electric field that should favour electron extraction and reduce charge recombination. We utilized ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) to characterize the energetics of the perovskite film with and without 3-APy treatment. The secondary electron cut-off (SECO) and the valence band maximum (VBM) spectra are shown in Fig.
2a . The 3-APy treatment reduced the work function from about 4.77 eV to 4.21 eV and shifted the VBM from about 0.80 eV to 1.51 eV, creating favourable surface energetics and band bending for extracting electrons and blocking holes (Supplementary Fig.
11 ). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted to understand the chemical changes at the surface. Survey spectra, core-level spectra and compositional ratios are shown in Supplementary Figs.
12 – 14 . The 3-APy surface treatment decreased the surface halide concentration from 42.3% (3.4 I:Pb) to 36.4% (2.5 I:Pb), increased carbon from 19.1% to 25.5%, and slightly reduced nitrogen from 22.8% to 20.6%, consistent with some of the proposed reaction product anchoring to the surface and some washing away. The 3-APy treatment also caused changes in the C 1 s
and N 1 s
core levels, which are shown qualitatively in Fig.
2b,c ; fits are shown in Supplementary Fig.
15a–d . The control sample has a C 1 s
bonding environment dominated by the N + = C H–N amidine bonds from FA (about 288 eV), with smaller contributions from
C H 3 –N (about 286 eV) bonds from MA, adventitious carbon ( C –C/ C =C) bonds (about 285 eV) and carboxyl ( C –O/ C =O) bonds (about 286 eV to 289 eV). Both the MA and the FA bonds are also visible in the N 1 s
spectrum at about 402 eV and about 400.5 eV, respectively 28 . Upon 3-APy treatment, we see a general increase in signal across the C 1 s
environment, particularly at lower binding energy, where bonds with fewer N groups and lower coordination are expected. This increase is dominated by enhancements to the signal at about 285 eV and about 287 eV that are consistent with the
C –C/ C =C and N– C H 2 –C bonds of 3-APy, respectively, and the emergence of a new peak between them that is consistent with the C= C H–N/C– C H=N pyridinic bonds of 3-APy (Supplementary Fig.
15e,f ) 29 . Turning to the N 1 s , we see a slight increase in the higher binding-energy peak that is consistent with the proposed reaction, which converts one of the lower-binding-energy C= N H 2 + /C– N H 2
amidine bonds from FA to a pyrrolic C– N H–C bond 28 . Moreover, we see no significant change to the peak at a lower binding energy, consistent with the aforementioned reaction being compensated by signals from the pyridinic C– N =C group of 3-APy 30 , 31 .

and
f . The brown, blue, pink, black and purple spheres denote C, N, H, Pb and I atoms, respectively. Full size image The iodine deficiency is consistent with the observed effective n-type doping and reduced work function associated with 3-APy treatment, because a V I
is a shallow donor 32 . We also conducted DFT calculations to understand the mechanism leading to the observed n-type Fermi-level shift induced by the 3-APy surface treatment. For simplification, we chose FAPbI 3
for DFT modelling, as it represents the main component used in this study. The DFT results are shown in Fig.
2d–g . We found that transforming surface FA +
via 3-APy treatment into MPyFA +
(a reaction product) on the surface can reduce the formation energy of a charged V I
by 0.19 eV. This reduced formation energy is consistent with the observed iodine deficiency and effective n-type doping in the surface region upon 3-APy treatment, and it is mainly owing to the electrostatic attraction between the positive charge of the V I
and the negative charge on the Py-ring side of MPyFA + , which is consistent with the significant rearrangement of the MPyFA cation (Fig.
2f,g ). Optoelectronic properties We conducted transient reflection spectroscopy to study the effect of 3-APy treatment on surface charge carrier dynamics (Fig.
3a,b
and Supplementary Note  2 ). With the 3-APy treatment, the effective surface recombination velocity decreased by one order of magnitude, from about 1.9 × 10 3  cm s −1
(control) to 0.2 × 10 3  cm s −1
(target). The ten-times reduction of the surface recombination velocity with 3-APy treatment is consistent with the improved surface potential distribution and the surface field induced by the n-type Fermi-level shift associated with the treatment. Furthermore, time-resolved microwave conductivity measurements showed an improved average weighted carrier lifetime (from about 1.7 µs to 2.1 µs; Supplementary Table
1 ) with the 3-APy treatment (Fig.
3c ). Fig. 3: Optoelectronic properties. a , b , Comparison of transient reflection spectroscopy measurements of the control perovskite film ( a ) and the target perovskite film with 3-APy surface reaction ( b ) to study the carrier diffusion and surface recombination dynamics.  R

Full size image Another good way to investigate optoelectronic properties is to measure the absolute photoluminescence of the devices. The photoluminescence intensity is a direct measure of the carrier density in the perovskite absorber and the corresponding quasi-Fermi-level splitting. Figure
3d
compares the absolute intensity photoluminescence of the control and target perovskite films in the p–i–n device configuration. The external radiative efficiency increased from about 0.4 ± 0.1% (control) to 2.0 ± 0.1% (target) at about 1-sun-equivalent photon fluence (about 1.7 × 10 17  cm −2  s −1 ) (Supplementary Note  3 ). This corresponds to a 42-mV gain in quasi-Fermi-level splitting, which is associated with the reduction of non-radiative recombination enabled by the 3-APy treatment. The inset in Fig.
3d
shows that after the 3-APy treatment, the slope of integrated photoluminescence intensity versus excitation fluence decreased from about 1.9 ± 0.1 to 1.6 ± 0.1, indicating reduced interface recombination 33 . Device characteristics We examined the impact of 3-APy treatment on the device characteristics using a typical p–i–n cell stack: glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/MeO-2PACZ/Rb 0.05 Cs 0.05 MA 0.05 FA 0.85 Pb(I 0.95 Br 0.05 ) 3 /lithium fluoride (LiF)/C 60 /bathocuproine (BCP)/silver (Ag), where MeO-2PACZ denotes [2-(3,6-Dimethoxy-9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid and is a self-assembled monolayer for hole-selective contact 34 . A typical cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy image of the device stack is shown in Supplementary Fig.

compares the PSCs based on the pristine perovskite (control) and 3-APy-treated perovskite (target). The 3-APy treatment increased thePCE from 23.39% (reverse)/22.18% (forwards) to 25.49% (reverse)/25.27% (forwards), owing to improvements in all parameters (Supplementary Table
2 ). The corresponding stabilized power output (SPO) was 22.85% and 25.35% for the control and target devices, respectively (Fig.
4a , inset). Moreover, the short-circuit current density
J sc
reached >26 mA cm −2
for the target cell, which is consistent with the external quantum efficiency (EQE) results (Fig.
4b ). Analysis of the EQE spectrum suggests a bandgap of about 1.53 eV (Supplementary Fig.
17 ), which is consistent with the optical absorption measurement (Supplementary Fig.
9 ). It is noted that the device hysteresis is also reduced for the target device. The improvements in these photovoltaic parameters validate the hypothesis that the observed enhancement in structural, interfacial and optoelectronic properties associated with the 3-APy treatment, as discussed in connection with Figs.
1 – 3 , is directly relevant to photovoltaic performance. The combination of the improved
J sc , open-circuit voltage ( V oc ) and fill factor (FF) was further verified based on statistical comparison of the photovoltaic parameters from 72 control and 246 target devices, with an average PCE enhancement ranging from 22% to 24.4% (Supplementary Fig.
18 ). Among these target devices, a maximum
V oc
of about 1.19 V (Supplementary Fig.
19 ) and a maximum FF of about 86% (Supplementary Fig.
20 ) were achieved, both with PCEs of about 25%. These results further attest to the effectiveness of the reactive surface modification with 3-APy in improving the interface for enhancing charge extraction with reduced recombination loss. One such device was measured by an accredited photovoltaic laboratory, obtaining a certified stabilized PCE of 24.05 ± 0.48% using an 11-point asymptotic
P max
(maximum power) scan protocol (Supplementary Fig.
21 ), along with
J – V
scans yielding a reverse-scan PCE of 25.37% and forwards-scan PCE of 25.06% (Supplementary Fig.

c , Stability of encapsulated control and target devices, held under resistive load (560 Ω) near the maximum power point, under 1-sun illumination at 55 ± 2 °C in air with 40–60% relative humidity. The initial device PCE was 22.3% for the control and 24.6% for the target. The devices were encapsulated with cover glass and epoxy (Gorilla 2 Part 4200101-2 Epoxy). Full size image We found that our reactive surface treatment also worked effectively for other FA-based perovskites (Supplementary Figs.
23
and
24 ) as well as various 3-APy-related molecules (Supplementary Fig.
25 ), making our approach a general strategy for improving p–i–n device performance. It is worth noting that surface treatment using the 3-APy-based iodide salt (3-APyI 2 )—which can form a two-dimensional surface layer—does not improve p–i–n device performance (Supplementary Fig.
26 ), probably owing to interfacial energy misalignment 13 . Furthermore, 3-APy surface treatment in n–i–p devices significantly decreased device performance (Supplementary Figs.
27
and
28 ), which confirms that n-type surface doping is ideal for p–i–n device operation, but it is detrimental to n–i–p devices. This result underscores the broader importance of designing surface treatment strategies that are both chemistry and functionality specific to a particular charge extraction interface. Finally, we investigated the operational reliability of encapsulated devices aged under continuous light illumination at about 55 °C in ambient air (Fig.
4c ). These devices were biased with fixed resistance loads near the maximum power point during illumination. The target device retained about 87% of its initial maximum PCE after 2,428 h, whereas the control kept only 76% over 1,368 h. We further examined the operation stability of unencapsulated target device at 65 °C under 1.2-sun continuous illumination in nitrogen (ISOS-L-2I). The device retained 90% of its maximum PCE after 1,315 h (Supplementary Fig.
29a ). Moreover, the damp heat (85 °C and 85% relative humidity; ISOS-D-3) test showed that the device retained 94% of its maximum PCE after 850 h (Supplementary Fig.
29b ). Taken together, our results suggest that the reactive surface engineering using 3-APy is an effective approach to significantly enhance p–i–n PSC performance to state-of-the-art levels of efficiency and operational reliability. Methods Materials Rubidium iodide (RbI, 99.99%), caesium iodide (CsI, 99.99%), lead iodide (PbI 2 , 99.999%) and 3-APy were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Organic salts of formamidinium iodide (FAI) and methylammonium bromide (MABr) were purchased from Greatcell Solar Materials; lead bromide (PbBr 2 ) and MeO-2PACZ were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry. Dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%, anhydrous), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%, anhydrous), chlorobenzene (99.9%, anhydrous) and toluene (99.9%, anhydrous) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. For evaporating materials, LiF was purchased from Alfa Aesar, C 60
was purchased from Lumtec and BCP was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All chemicals were used directly as received. Perovskite precursor solution The perovskite composition is Rb 0.05 Cs 0.05 MA 0.05 FA 0.85 Pb(I 0.95 Br 0.05 ) 3 . The perovskite precursor was prepared in mixed solvents of DMF:DMSO (volume ratio 4:1). The chemical molar ratio of CsI, RbI, FAI, PbI 2 , PbBr 2
and MABr is 0.05, 0.05, 0.85, 0.95, 0.05 and 0.05, respectively, and the concentration is 1.5 M. Synthesis of 3-picolyamine iodide salt (3-APyI 2 ) A mixture of 3-picolyamine (1.50 ml, 14.7 mmol) and ethanol (50 ml) was added to a round-bottom flask and cooled in an ice bath. While rapidly stirring, a slight excess of concentrated hydroiodic acid (4.75 ml, 31.0 mmol) was slowly added. After stirring for 1 h, a precipitate had formed and was removed from the mixture via vacuum filtration and washed with diethyl ether (4 × 50 ml). The product was then dried overnight at 55 °C under vacuum. Device fabrication The patterned transparent conducting oxide glass substrates (ITO or fluorine doped tin oxide [FTO]) were washed with acetone and isopropanol for 15 min each. After ultraviolet ozone treatment for 15 min, a 0.5 mg ml −1
MeO-2PACZ self-assembled monolayer solution dissolved in ethanol was spin-coated on substrates at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s in a nitrogen glovebox, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. The perovskite composition is Rb 0.05 Cs 0.05 MA 0.05 FA 0.85 Pb(I 0.95 Br 0.05 ) 3 , and the initial stock perovskite solution is 1.5 M. In detail, CsI (19.5 mg), RbI (15.9 mg), MABr (8.4 mg), FAI (219.5 mg), PbI 2
(656.9 mg) and PbBr 2
(27.5 mg) were dissolved in 1 ml mixed solvent of DMF:DMSO (v:v = 4:1), shaken by a vortex shaker for about 1–2 h to make it fully dissolved. The 1.5 M perovskite precursor solution, without filtering and dilution, was used for preparing perovskite films. Perovskite precursor solutions prepared on the same day or aged within about two weeks (in sealed vials) can be used without noticeable impact on device performance. We used an SCS G3 spin coater (model G3P8) for spin-coating. No intentional acceleration steps were used during spin-coating; the target spin speed can be reached within 1 s. Specifically, the substrate was first spinning at 1,000 r.p.m. (within 1 s from 0 to 1,000; no slow acceleration steps) for 10 s, and then at 3,000 r.p.m. (no slow acceleration steps) for 40 s. After 15 s into the second stage (3,000 r.p.m., 40 s), 150 µl chlorobenzene antisolvent was dropped on top of the spinning substrates (about 1-cm distance). The perovskite sample was subsequently annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. For 3-APy treatment, the diluted toluene solution of 3-APy (0.1 mM) was spin-coated on the perovskite surface at 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s, followed by annealing at 70 °C for 5 min. Afterwards, samples were transferred to an Angstrom evaporator for LiF (1 nm)/C 60
(30 nm)/BCP (6 nm)/Ag (100 nm) deposition. The device area by evaporation was 0.112 cm 2 . Unless otherwise stated, the devices were masked with metal aperture masks (0.059 cm 2 ) during the
J – V
measurement. KPFM characterizations KPFM measurements were performed on a D5000 atomic force microscope inside an argon-filled glovebox. We used a platinum–iridium-coated silicon probe (PPP-EFM) in tapping mode. The plane-view samples were scanned in at least three random locations to ensure reliable measurements. The mapping contains 1,024 pixels in the fast-scan axis and 256 lines in the slow-scan axis. The scan rate is 0.35 Hz. XPS and UPS measurements XPS and UPS measurements were performed on a Kratos AXIS-Supra in the Surface Science Facility at the UC Irvine Materials Research Institute. X-ray radiation was produced by a monochromatic Al Kα excitation centred at 1,486.6 eV. UPS radiation was produced by ionizing helium  i
(energy 21.22 eV). XPS survey spectra were collected using a step size of 1 eV and pass energy of 160 eV; core-level spectra were collected using a step size of 0.1 eV and pass energy of 20 eV; and UPS spectra were conducted using a step size of 0.02 eV and pass energy of 10 eV. The electron binding-energy scale was calibrated using the Fermi edge and core levels of gold and silver substrates cleaned with argon-ion bombardment. To ensure that important energetic information was preserved, UPS scans and I 3 d 5/2
low-power XPS (1.5 W versus 225 W) scans were conducted at the beginning of analysis, each on unanalysed locations. To attempt to account for energetic shifts arising from the beam damage that is unavoidable in the high-power core-level scans, all core levels were shifted back such that their high-power I 3 d 5/2
peak (225 W, 0.5 min) overlapped with the low-power peak (1.5 W, 4 min). UPS spectra were numerically corrected for satellite peaks that arose from the polychromic helium radiation 35 . XPS peaks were fit using a Gaussian–Lorentzian peak-fitting algorithm with a Shirley background using the XPST package on Igor WaveMetrics. Work functions were determined using the intersection between the baseline and a linear fit to the SECO. VBMs were calculated using linear extrapolation of the valence band feature to the background signal on a semi-log plot. Transient reflection measurement Transient reflection measurements were performed with a Coherent laser (800-nm fundamental beam, 1-kHz repetition rate, 3-mJ pulse and 100-fs pulse width). The fundamental beam was split into a pump and probe pulse. The probe pulse was used to generate a white light supercontinuum via a sapphire crystal that was then sent through a delay line with a timescale up to 2.5 ns. The pump pulse was tuned using a Palitra Duo optical parametric amplifier to obtain varying excitation wavelengths. The pump and probe pulses were aligned spatially onto the sample at an approximately 45° angle to the sample surface. A Helios ultrafast spectrometer was used for detection, with the spectrometer at a 90° angle to the incident pump and probe beams. The excitation density for all transient reflection measurements was kept so that the initial number of photogenerated charge carriers directly after pump excitation did not exceed about 4 × 10 17  charge carriers per cm 3 . A global fit analysis was performed on the measurements in accordance with previously reported protocols 36 . Time-resolved microwave conductivity measurement Perovskite target and control films were prepared in an identical manner to those used in devices, except onto precleaned 25 × 11 × 1-mm quartz plates (Technical Glass Products). Microwave conductivity measurements were conducted using previously described protocols 37 . In brief, a 5-ns pulse width, 10-Hz laser at 643 nm was coupled into an X-band resonant cavity to photo-generate carriers in each perovskite film, the power from which was measured before and after each measurement using a photothermal detector placed at the sample position and masked by the optical widow and waveguide sections when the sample was present. Each sample was positioned inside the microwave cavity such that excitation was always incident to the quartz side, and continuous nitrogen purge was applied to the cavity during all measurements. Neutral density filters were used to attenuate the beam power over one order of magnitude to below 10 10  cm −2
absorbed photon flux. For analysis, each sample’s fraction of absorbed light was measured inside an integrating sphere diffuse reflectance accessory (Cary 7000i), whereas the beam attenuation profiles of the filter combinations were extracted from the measured specular transmission data for each neutral density filter at the excitation wavelength. Photoluminescence characterization Excitation at 632.8 nm (HeNe laser) was used to measure photoluminescence emission spectra. A Princeton Instruments HRS300 spectrograph with silicon charge-coupled-device (Pixis F100) and indium gallium arsenide (PyLoN IR) detectors was used. The spectral response of the detectors and spectrometer system was corrected using calibration sources (IntelliCal for visible and infrared ranges, Princeton Instruments) and placing calibration sources at the sample position. Excitation beam size was determined with a charge-coupled-device camera. Data were measured in absolute photon numbers using Spectralon reflectance standards (LabSphere) and assuming that 1-sun equivalent fluence for 1.53-eV bandgap is about 1.73 × 10 17  photons cm −2  s −1 . DFT calculations The structural relaxation and static self-consistent energy calculations are performed by CP2K package at the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof level 38 , 39 . A six-layer FAPbI 3
perovskite slab model is constructed for the cases before and after 3-APy treatment with typical (001) orientation selected on the surface, which is terminated by FAI. The double-ξ valence polarization basis set trained from optimized molecular geometries is used in the calculations with only the gamma point considered, and an energy cut-off of 550 Rydberg is set. The formation energy difference of a charged V I
on the surface region with and without 3-APy treatment is calculated by the following equation: $$\Delta {E}_{{\rm{f}}}=({E}_{{\rm{w}}}({{\rm{V}}}_{{\rm{I}}},q)-{E}_{{\rm{w}}})-({E}_{{\rm{w}}/{\rm{o}}}({{\rm{V}}}_{{\rm{I}}},q)-{E}_{{\rm{w}}/{\rm{o}}})$$ where
E w (V I ,  q ) is the total energy of the supercell with the 3-APy cation and a charged V I ,
E w
is the total energy of the supercell with the 3-APy cation but without a charged V I ,
E w/o (V I ,  q ) is the total energy of the supercell without the 3-APy cation but with a charged V I ,
q
denotes the elementary charge, and
E w/o
is the total energy of the supercell without the 3-AP cation and without a charged V I . Mass spectrometry measurement The sample was diluted 1:1,000 v/v in acetonitrile and analysed with a Thermo Scientific Q-Exactive mass spectrometer equipped with a heated electrospray ionization source. The sample was directly infused via a syringe pump at 10 µl min −1 , with the following source conditions: sheath gas flow, 10 arbitrary units; aux gas flow, 0 arbitrary units; spray voltage, +2.9 kV; capillary temperature, 320 °C; S-lens radio frequency voltage, 50 V; aux gas heater, 0 °C. Spectra were collected with a resolution of 140,000 at
m / z
200 and an automatic gain control target of 1 million. Full-scan spectra were collected from
m / z
50–700 and mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry data were collected by quadrupole isolation of
m / z
136 ± 2 and fragmented with normalized collision energy values of 10 and 60 to yield the full fragmentation profile. Quasi mass spectrometry data were collected by inducing fragmentation in the source region, and isolating
m / z
92 ± 2, followed by fragmentation at 60 normalized collision energy. Molecular formula assignments were based on accurate mass and
13 C isotopic fine structure. Other characterizations The optical properties of the perovskite films were measured using ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (Cary 6000i). The crystal structures of perovskite films were recorded using an X-ray diffractometer (D-Max 2200, Rigaku). The morphologies and microstructures of the perovskite films and cross-sectional structures of the solar cells were investigated using a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope. The
J – V
curves were measured in a nitrogen glovebox using a Newport Oriel Sol3A class solar simulator with a xenon lamp that was calibrated before use with a silicon cell under a KG2 filter. The SPOs of the devices were measured by monitoring the photocurrent density output evolution under the biased voltage set near the maximum power point. EQE measurements were performed in ambient air using a Newport Oriel IQE200 with monochromatic light focused on the device pixels and a chopper frequency of 37 Hz.

A limit on the thermodynamic potential difference between the ground and excited states of any photochemical system is established by evaluating the potential difference at which the rate of photon absorption and emission are equal; the relationship between absorption and emission is given by a Planck‐law relation, provided that there is thermal equilibrium between the sublevels of each electronic band. The actual potential developed may be evaluated if the quantum yield of luminescence is known. The maximum amount of power storage obtainable is evaluated by lowering the potential difference until the product of the potential difference and the fraction of the quanta retained is maximized. The history and applications of the Planck‐law relation between absorption and emission spectra are discussed briefly, and applications of the potential difference calculation are mentioned.

Abstract
Charge transport layers (CTLs) are key components of diffusion controlled perovskite solar cells, however, they can induce additional non-radiative recombination pathways which limit the open circuit voltage ( V OC ) of the cell. In order to realize the full thermodynamic potential of the perovskite absorber, both the electron and hole transport layer (ETL/HTL) need to be as selective as possible. By measuring the photoluminescence yield of perovskite/CTL heterojunctions, we quantify the non-radiative interfacial recombination currents in
pin - and
nip -type cells including high efficiency devices (21.4%). Our study comprises a wide range of commonly used CTLs, including various hole-transporting polymers, spiro-OMeTAD, metal oxides and fullerenes. We find that all studied CTLs limit the
V OC
by inducing an additional non-radiative recombination current that is in most cases substantially larger than the loss in the neat perovskite and that the least-selective interface sets the upper limit for the
V OC
of the device. Importantly, the
V OC
equals the internal quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) in the absorber layer only in high efficiency cells, while in poor performing devices, the
V OC
is substantially lower than the QFLS. Using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and differential charging capacitance experiments we show that this is due to an energy level mis-alignment at the
p -interface. The findings are corroborated by rigorous device simulations which outline important considerations to maximize the
V OC . This work highlights that the challenge to suppress non-radiative recombination losses in perovskite cells on their way to the radiative limit lies in proper energy level alignment and in suppression of defect recombination at the interfaces.

Abstract The open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) deficit in perovskite solar cells is greater in wide-bandgap (over 1.7 eV) cells than in perovskites of roughly 1.5 eV (refs.  1 , 2 ). Quasi-Fermi-level-splitting measurements show
V OC -limiting recombination at the electron-transport-layer contact 3 , 4 , 5 . This, we find, stems from inhomogeneous surface potential and poor perovskite–electron transport layer energetic alignment. Common monoammonium surface treatments fail to address this; as an alternative, we introduce diammonium molecules to modify perovskite surface states and achieve a more uniform spatial distribution of surface potential. Using 1,3-propane diammonium, quasi-Fermi-level splitting increases by 90 meV, enabling 1.79 eV perovskite solar cells with a certified 1.33 V
V OC
and over 19% power conversion efficiency (PCE). Incorporating this layer into a monolithic all-perovskite tandem, we report a record
V OC
of 2.19 V (89% of the detailed balance
V OC
limit) and over 27% PCE (26.3% certified quasi-steady state). These tandems retained more than 86% of their initial PCE after 500 h of operation.

Main The wide range of bandgaps achievable using metal-halide perovskites (around 1.2–3.0 eV) has enabled the development of tandem solar cells with silicon, copper indium gallium selenide and organic photovoltaics 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 . Recently, all-perovskite tandems made from stacked wide-bandgap (WBG; approximately 1.8 eV) and narrow-bandgap (NBG; approximately 1.2 eV) layers surpassed the highest recorded power conversion efficiency (PCE) for a single-junction perovskite solar cell (PSC) 10 , 11 . Despite rapid progress, the PCE of perovskite tandems is limited by the large open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) loss of the WBG cell 1 , 2 . Whereas single-junction PSCs of around 1.5 eV have demonstrated
V OC
deficits (the difference between the bandgap and device
V OC ) as low as 0.3 V 12 , mixed iodide/bromide PSCs over 1.75 eV have yet to achieve
V OC
deficits lower than 0.5 V (Supplementary Fig.
1 ) 13 , 14 . The
V OC
deficit has been suggested to stem from increased trap density in perovskites with over 20% Br concentration, photoinduced halide segregation and poor energetic alignment with charge transport layers 15 , 16 . The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of perovskites, once in contact with charge transport layers, tends to decrease markedly, suggesting that the perovskite–transport layer interface produces recombination pathways within the perovskite bandgap 3 , 4 , 5 . Several causes have been reported in efforts to uncover the origin of this phenomenon, including band misalignment 16 , energy-level pinning 5
and halide migration from the perovskite into the transport layer 17 . Here we examine the perovskite–C 60
interface because it is ubiquitous in perovskite tandems, is the most easily accessed interface when fabricating inverted ( pin ) PSCs and yet is still considered one of the worst offenders in regard to induction of trap states 5 , 16 . We spin-coated WBG perovskite (Cs 0.2 FA 0.8 Pb(I 0.6 Br 0.4 ) 3 ) films on top of indium tin oxide (ITO)/hole transport layer (HTL) substrates with the structure ITO/NiOx/[4-(3,6-dimethyl-9H-carbazol-9-yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Me-4PACz) and measured their PLQY with and without a C 60
layer (Fig.
1b ). Consistent with previous reports 3 , 5
we found that, after C 60
deposition, the PLQY is two orders of magnitude lower, equivalent to a drop of about 100 meV in quasi-Fermi-level splitting (QFLS) 18 .

e , DOS calculated for bulk perovskite and different surface structures. Detailed DOS plots in the gap region are shown in zoomed-in insets, in which the control (slab) DOS are represented by blue dashed lines. Full size image Previous studies have focused on post treatments that reduce the defect density of the perovskite surface and thus increase the PLQY of films 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 . Extending this practice to WBG perovskites, we found that treating the surface with the popular passivant butylammonium iodide (BA) increases PLQY but that the improvement was not retained following deposition of C 60
(Fig.
1b ). Indeed, the QFLS of the stack is probably pinned due to interfacial recombination rather than the inherent trap density of the perovskite 5 . Seeking a different approach, we reasoned that tuning the surface potential at the perovskite–C 60
interface would suppress this cross-interface recombination by reducing band offset between perovskite and C 60 , and by reducing the population of minority carriers at the interface. This effect is analogous to field-effect passivation in traditional Si solar cells 23 , 24 . Thus, we turned our focus toward short-chain diammonium ligands, strong Lewis bases previously shown to induce n-type doping and surface dipoles that alter surface energetics in mixed Pb–Sn perovskites 25 , 26 , 27 . Treating the perovskite surface with 1,3-propane-diammonium iodide (PDA) (Fig.
1a ), the diammonium equivalent to BA, we observed only a slight increase in PLQY. However, following deposition of C 60
there was no marked drop in PLQY, suggesting that the recombination pathways induced by C 60
had been effectively suppressed. We also compared the effects of perovskite post treatments with similar concentrations of 1,2-ethane-diammonium iodide (EDA) and 1,4-butane-diammonium iodide, diammonium ligands with a shorter and longer chain length, respectively. Of these diammonium ligands, only PDA resulted in retention of PLQY after deposition of C 60
(Supplementary Fig.
3 ). To understand how both treatments affect interface energetics, we used ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and found that BA induces a Fermi-level downshift whereas PDA induces a Fermi-level upshift, resulting in stronger and weaker surface p-type doping, respectively (Fig.
1c ). The latter change in surface potential produces a lower minority carrier concentration at the interface and reduces band offset between perovskite and C 60
by 60 meV. Drift-diffusion modelling suggests that this has the potential to increase QFLS by approximately 90 meV (Supplementary Fig.
4 ). Using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Supplementary Figs.
5
and
6 ), we found that PDA ligands are present on the film surface after treatment. Using density functional theory, we studied work function changes following PDA treatment of various surface structures (Supplementary Fig.
7
and Fig.
1d ). Among considered surface configurations, the pristine Pb-I-terminated surface with a bromide vacancy ( V Br ), which exhibited a lower work function (by 0.44 eV) after PDA treatment (Supplementary Fig.
8 ), was in best agreement with the 0.1 eV shift obtained from experimental UPS data. Then, through density of states (DOS) analysis of BA and PDA surface treatments (Fig.
1e
and Supplementary Fig.
9 ) we found that, after PDA treatment, the in-gap surface states near the valence band maximum region were suppressed (Supplementary Materials), consistent with Fermi-level upshift relative to the valence band maximum (Fig.
1c ) observed in UPS measurements. Seeking to investigate how PDA affects films at the nanoscale, we used hyperspectral imaging to generate QFLS maps of perovskite films with and without C 60
(Fig.
2a,b
and Supplementary Fig.
10 ). From these maps we observed significantly greater spatial fluctuation than that observed for perovskites with narrower bandgaps (under 1.65 eV), which have a typical standard deviation ( σ ) in QFLS of around 10 meV 4 , 28 . After PDA treatment, however,
σ
was lowered significantly (from 61 to 24 meV), suggesting that the treated film is more homogeneous. After C 60
deposition the QFLS of the control dropped (1.32 to 1.25 eV) and broadened further ( σ  = 77 meV), whereas that of the PDA film was maintained at 1.33 eV but with a slightly narrower distribution ( σ  = 22 meV). Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) (Fig.
2c,d
and Supplementary Fig.
11 ) suggested that this effect is correlated with the nonuniform contact potential of the control film, which will act to broaden interfacial electronic states when in contact with C 60
leading to increased recombination 5 , 29 . PDA treatment narrowed contact potential distribution significantly ( σ  = 2.9 mV compared with 11.1 mV for the control), which is indicative of reduced recombination and improved carrier extraction 30 , 31 .

Films were encapsulated between two glass slides to mitigate environmental damage. Full size image We used grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) to show the crystallographic consequences of PDA treatment. Varying the incident angle of the X-ray beam, we compared the crystal structure of the film bulk (1.00°) and surface (0.15°) (Fig.
2e–h
and Supplementary Fig.
12 ). In contrast to previous perovskite systems treated with diammonium ligands, there exist no low- q -value peaks for the PDA-treated film and, thus, no indication of reduced-dimensional perovskite formation 32 , 33 , nor of a perovskite polymorph 34 . The concentration of PDA spin-coated onto the perovskite surface is low and thus does not appear to result in appreciable diffusion into the bulk perovskite. Two structural differences between control and treated films are apparent, however: (1) a peak at 0.88 Å −1
for the control that we ascribe to PbI 2 , which was entirely removed by PDA, and (2) a secondary peak with a
q -space value of 1.03 Å −1
alongside the (1 1 0) perovskite peak (1.00 Å −1 ), indicative of a Br-rich phase. This secondary peak is more obvious when probing only the first 5 nm or so of film, suggesting that the film surface is segregated into PbI 2 - and Br-rich perovskite regions, the probable cause of the broad contact potential 35 . The suppression of surface phase segregation and removal of PbI 2
implies that, whereas PDA does not induce the formation of a new crystal phase, it does react with the surface of the perovskite. This has been observed previously with diammoniums that template the growth of perovskite crystallization 36 , 37 , and is corroborated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Supplementary Fig.
13 ), transient absorption (Supplementary Fig.
14 ) and transient reflection spectra (Fig.
2i,j ). Transient reflection spectra show that two additional bleaches are present in the control compared with the PDA-treated sample: a peak around 500 nm (PbI 2 ) and a fast-decaying bleach at around 600 nm (approximately 85% Br-rich perovskite, which correlates exactly with the shift in
q -space seen in GIWAXS) 38 . Encouraged by the reduced interfacial recombination and surface homogeneity imparted by PDA treatment, we fabricated WBG solar cells. The device structure was ITO/NiOx/Me-4PACz/perovskite/C 60 /ALD SnOx/Ag, in which Me-4PACz is a self-assembled monolayer of [4-(3,6-dimethyl-9H-carbazol-9-yl)butyl]phosphonic acid. Figure

shows the forward and reverse
J–V
curves for champion control and PDA-treated 1.79 eV WBG PSCs (external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum shown in Supplementary Fig.
15 ), exhibiting an increase in
V OC
from 1.23 to 1.33 V, the highest value of
V OC
reported for PSCs of around 1.8 eV (Supplementary Fig.
1 ). Figure

shows the

curve of a PDA-treated PSC exhibiting a
V OC
of around 1.33 V and PCE of 19.3%, as verified by the photovoltaic (PV) cell and module performance group at the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) (Supplementary Fig.
16 ). Improvements in device
V OC , fill factor (FF) and PCE were consistent across 30 control and PDA-treated devices, as shown in Fig.
3c . We also fabricated 1 cm 2
WBG devices using PDA surface treatment, which delivered a
V OC
of around 1.35 V and PCE of 19.0% (Supplementary Fig.
17 ). Fig. 3: Characterization of WBG perovskite solar cells. a ,

losses were extracted from pseudo- J–V

and Supplementary Table
3 . 95% DB represents 95% of the detailed balance limit for
V OC , and corresponding PCE. Full size image We conducted transient photovoltage and photocurrent measurements of control and PDA-treated devices (Supplementary Fig.
19 ). The charge-recombination lifetime ( τ r ) of the PDA-treated device was longer than that of the control device (2.0 µs compared to 0.4 µs), consistent with reduced carrier trapping at the C 60
interface after PDA post treatment (Supplementary Fig.
20
and Supplementary Table
4 ) 39 . Calculating diffusion length (Supplementary Note  2 ), we found that PDA treatment resulted in a twofold increase, from 600 nm to 1.2 µm. We followed the output of a PDA-treated WBG cell operating for 700 h at the maximum power point (MPP) to determine the impact of PDA on device stability (Supplementary Fig.
21 ). After 700 h of continuous operation under 1 sun illumination, the PDA-treated device exhibited no loss in PCE. We attribute this to an increased ion migration barrier exhibited in PDA-treated films, calculated from thermal admittance spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig.
22 ). We used intensity-dependent PLQY measurements to conduct systematic loss analysis (pseudo- J–V ) of control versus PDA-treated films (Fig.
3d
and Supplementary Table
3 ) 40 . Both samples have similar bulk and HTL interface losses, but PDA treatment reduced
V OC
loss at the electron transport layer (ETL) from 104 to 16 mV. PDA also eliminated a 14 mV mismatch between the full-stack QFLS and device
V OC
present in the control sample, indicating a reduced band offset between perovskite and C 60
after treatment 16 , consistent with the band alignment analysis shown in Fig.
1 . In addition to reduced
V OC
loss, PDA-treated devices exhibited reduced transport (FF) losses compared with the control (3.4% abs.
versus 8.0% abs. ) (Supplementary Table
3 ). This also suggests favourable band bending at the treated interface, resulting in improved carrier extraction. Using our high- V OC
PDA-treated WBG active layer in combination with a Cs 0.05 FA 0.7 MA 0.25 Pb 0.5 Sn 0.5 I 3
NBG mixed Pb–Sn perovskite (approximately 1.2 eV), we fabricated monolithic all-perovskite tandem solar cells ( Methods ). The tandem device structure was ITO/NiOx/Me-4PACz/WBG perovskite/C 60 /ALD SnOx/Au (1 nm)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/NBG perovskite/C 60 /ALD SnOx/Ag (Fig.
4a ); the SEM cross-sectional image shows the thick Pb–Sn perovskite layer (approximate thickness 1.0 µm) needed for current matching (Fig.
4b ) 10 . The integrated short-circuit current density ( J SC ) values for WBG and NBG subcells from EQE measurements of a tandem device were 15.4 and 15.2 mA cm –2 , respectively (Fig.
4c ). Bandgaps of WBG and NBG subcells calculated from the EQE spectra were 1.79 and 1.22 eV, respectively. Fig. 4: PV performance and stability of perovskite tandem solar cells. a , Schematic diagram of tandem device structure.

shows forward and reverse
J–V
scans of a champion tandem, WBG and NBG PSCs. A record PCE of 27.4% was achieved with a high
V OC
of 2.19 V, along with a
J SC
of 15.1 mA cm –2
and FF of 83.1%. The 2.19 V
V OC
represents a significant improvement over the previous highest reported
V OC
among the best all-perovskite tandems 10 , 41 , 42 , 43 , 44
because of the high
V OC
of the PDA-treated WBG subcell. We sent a tandem cell to an accredited independent PV calibration laboratory (NREL). The device delivered a certified PCE of 26.29% and
V OC
of 2.13 V (Fig.
4e
and Supplementary Fig.
23 ), representing a certified all-perovskite tandem that surpasses the record PCE (25.7%) of single-junction perovskite solar cells using the asymptotic maximum power ( P max ) scan protocol 11 , 45 . We also fabricated 1 cm 2
all-perovskite tandem solar cells, which delivered a PCE of 26.03% and
V OC
of 2.16 V (Supplementary Fig.
24 ). We note that there is still room for improvement, particularly in the
J SC
value of the tandem because
J SC
values of over 16.5 mA cm –2
have been reported 10 . Therefore, we anticipate that PCEs approaching 30% are already experimentally feasible. We tested operating stability using MPP tracking of an encapsulated tandem in ambient air (Fig.
4f ). Under global standard spectrum (AM1.5G) 1 sun illumination at MPP, the device retained 86% of its initial PCE after 500 h of continuous operation. This promising operating stability, in combination with high
V OC
and PCE enabled by diammonium surface modification, represents an important step towards the application of all-perovskite tandem solar cells. Methods Materials All materials were used as received without further purification. Commercial ITO substrates (20 Ω per square, 25 × 25 mm 2 ) were purchased from TFD, Inc.

Perovskite precursor solutions WBG perovskite Wide-bandgap perovskite precursor solution (1.2 M, FA 0.8 Cs 0.2 Pb(I 0.6 Br 0.4 ) 3 ) was prepared by dissolving CsI, FAI, PbBr 2
and PbI 2
in a mixture of solvents DMF and DMSO at a volume ratio of 4:1. The precursor solution was stirred at 60 °C for 1 h and then filtered using a 0.22 μm polytetrafluoroethylene membrane before use. NBG perovskite Narrow-bandgap perovskite precursor solution (1.8 M, Cs 0.05 FA 0.7 MA 0.25 Pb 0.5 Sn 0.5 I 3 ) was prepared by dissolving CsI, FAI, MAI, SnI 2
and PbI 2
in a mixture of DMF and DMSO at a volume ratio of 3:1. Tin powder (5 mg), GuaSCN (4 mg), SnF 2
(14 mg), 4F-PEABr (2 mg) and glycine hydrochloride (4 mg) were added to the precursor solution, which was then stirred at room temperature for 1 h. The precursor solution was filtered using a 0.22 μm polytetrafluoroethylene membrane before use. Solar cell fabrication Single junction wide bandgap perovskite solar cells NiO x
nanocrystal (10 mg ml −1
in H 2 O and 2-Propanol mixed solvent with volume ratio of 3:1) layers were first spin-coated on ITO substrates at 3,000 rpm for 25 s in air without any post-treatment, then the substrates were immediately transferred to the glovebox. The NiO x
nanoparticles were prepared via the hydrolysis reaction of nickel nitrate referring to our previous work 46 . Me-4PACz (0.3 mg ml −1 ) in ethanol was spin-coated on the NiO x
film at 3,000 rpm for 25 s and then annealed at 100
o C for 10 min. For the perovskite film fabrication, the substrate was spun at 4,000 rpm for 32 s with an acceleration of 1,000 rpm, 100 μL Anisole was dropped onto the substrate during the last 8 s of the spinning. The substrates were then transferred onto a hotplate and heated at 100 °C for 15 min. The organic salts surface treatment solutions were prepared by dissolving PDAI 2 , and BAI in IPA with different concentrations. The optimal concentration of PDAI 2
used in devices was 1 mg ml –1 . The surface treatment was finished by depositing 130 µl organic salts solution onto the perovskite film surface at a spin rate of 4,000 rpm for 25 seconds with a 1,000 rpm s –1
acceleration. The film was then annealed at 100 °C for 5 min. After cooling down to room temperature, the substrates were transferred to the evaporation system and a 20-nm-thick C 60
film was subsequently deposited on top by thermal evaporation at a rate of 0.2 A s –1 . The substrates were then transferred to the atomic layer deposition (ALD) system (Picosun) to deposit 20 nm SnO 2
at 90 ºC using precursors of tetrakis(dimethylamino) tin (iv) (99.9999%) and deionized water. A 140 nm Ag electrode was then deposited by thermal evaporation. Single-junction Pb–Sn perovskite solar cells Prepatterned ITO glass substrates were sequentially cleaned using acetone and isopropanol. PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated on ITO substrates at 6,000 rpm for 30 s and annealed on a hot plate at 160 °C for 20 min in ambient air. After cooling we transferred the substrates immediately to a nitrogen-filled glovebox for deposition of perovskite films, which were deposited with a two-step spin-coating procedure: (1) 1,000 rpm for 10 s at acceleration 200 rpm s −1
and (2) 3,800 rpm for 45 s at acceleration 1,000 rpm s −1 ; 300 µl of chlorobenzene was dropped onto the spinning substrate during the second spin-coating step at 20 s before the end of the procedure. Substrates were then treated on the hot plate for 10 min at 100 °C. Post treatment with EDAI 2
was carried out by spin-coating a solution of 0.5 mg ml –1
EDAI 2
in 4:3 isopropyl alcohol (IPA)IPA:toluene at 4,000 rpm for 25 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 5 min. Next, 20 nm of C60, 8 nm of BCP and 140 nm of Ag were sequentially deposited on top of the perovskite layer by thermal evaporation 46 . All-perovskite tandem solar cells Wide-bandgap perovskite solar cell fabrication was completed as described above until deposition of ALD SnO 2 , after which 1 nm of Au was deposited by thermal evaporation. Next, PEDOT:PSS (diluted at a 1:2 volume ratio in IPA) was spin-coated onto the WBG subcell at 4,000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 120 °C for 10 min. Substrates were then cooled and transferred to a N 2 -filled glovebox for deposition of the NBG subcell. The NBG perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated onto substrates at 1,000 rpm for 10 s, followed by 3,800 rpm for 45 s. At 20 s before the end of the second step, 300 µl of chlorobenzene was dropped onto the substrate, which was then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. Post treatment with EDA was carried out by spin-coating a solution of 0.5 mg ml –1
EDAI 2
in 4:3 IPA:toluene at 4,000 rpm for 25 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 5 min. Finally, C 60
(30 nm), ALD SnO 2
(20 nm) and Ag (140 nm) were sequentially deposited as described above. Device testing Current density–voltage ( J–V ) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under illumination from a solar simulator (Newport, Class A) with a light intensity of 100 S5 mW cm −2
(checked with a calibrated reference solar cell from Newport).
J–V
curves were measured in a nitrogen atmosphere with a scanning rate of 100 mV s −1
(voltage step of 10 mV and delay time of 200 ms). The active area was determined by the aperture shade mask (0.049 cm 2
for small-area devices) placed in front of the solar cell. A spectral mismatch factor of 1.0 was used for all
J–V
measurements. For stabilized output measurements at MPP, the device testing chamber was maintained under ambient conditions. Solar cells were fixed at the MPP voltage (determined from
J–V
sweeps in both scanning directions) and current output was tracked over time. EQE measurements were performed in ambient air using a QuantX-300 Quantum Efficiency Measurement System (Newport), with monochromatic light focused on the device pixel and a chopper frequency of 20 Hz. For tandem solar cells, EQE measurements were performed in ambient air and bias illumination from bright LEDs, with emission peaks of 850 and 450 nm used for measurement of the front and back subcells, respectively. No bias voltage was applied during EQE measurement of tandem solar cells. Stability testing Devices were placed in a homemade stability-tracking station. For single-junction devices, the illumination source was a white light LED with intensity calibrated to match 1 sun conditions. For tandem solar cells, an AM1.5G solar simulator illumination source (G2V sunbrick) with an intensity of 100 mW cm −2
was used. For room temperature tests (ISOS-L-1I), the device chamber was sealed and supplied with continuous N 2
purging. MPPs were tracked by a perturb-and-observe algorithm that updates the MPP point every 10 s. Encapsulation was performed using a capping device with a glass slide, with ultraviolet-adhesive (Lumtec LT-U001) as sealant. GIWAXS GIWAXS measurements were conducted at the BXDS (LE-wiggler) beamline of the Canadian Light Source (CLS) using X-rays of wavelength
λ  = 0.82 Å, at a grazing incidence angle of either 0.15° or 1.00° and an exposure time of 5 s. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction patterns were collected by a MarCCD 225 detector with a sample–detector distance of 430 mm, and are presented in
q- coordinates using the equation
q  = 4πsin θ   λ –1 , where
θ
is half of the diffraction angle. In the present grazing incidence X-ray diffraction data,

was calibrated by measurement of XRD from a Lanthanum hexaboride reference sample. Images were calibrated using LaB6 and processed via the Nika software package 47
and GIXSGUI MATLAB plug-in 48 . Drift-diffusion simulations Simulations of perovskite solar cells were conducted in the heterojunction solar cell simulator SCAPS-1D, v.3.3.07 (ref.
49 ). Transient-absorption/time-resolved spectroscopy Femtosecond laser pulses of 1,030 nm generated by a Yb:KGW laser at 5 kHz repetition rate (Pharos (Light Conversion)) were passed through an optical parametric amplifier (Orpheus (Light Conversion)) selected for 450 nm light. The beam passed through the parametric amplifier served as the pump pulse, whereas the probe pulse was generated by focusing the initial 1,030 nm pulse into a sapphire crystal, which resulted in a white light continuum (Helios (Ultrafast)). With a temporal resolution of the system of around 250 fs, each time step meant delaying the probe pulse with respect to the pump, with time steps that increased exponentially. Every other pump pulse was blocked with a chopper to determine the change in optical density. After passing through a grating spectrograph, pulses were measured by means of a charge-coupled device (Helios (Ultrafast)). Intensity-dependent PLQY measurements The excitation source was an unfocused beam of a 442 nm continuous-wave diode laser. Photoluminescence was collected using an integrating sphere with a precalibrated fibre coupled to a spectrometer (Ocean Optics QE Pro) with an intensity of approximately 300 mW cm −2 . PLQY values were calculated by
\({\rm{PLQY}}=\frac{{P}_{{\rm{S}}}}{{P}_{{\rm{Ex}}}\times A}\) , where
\(A=1-\frac{{P}_{{\rm{L}}}}{{P}_{{\rm{Ex}}}}\)  represents absorption,
P S
is the integrated photon count of sample emission following laser excitation,
P Ex
is the integrated photon count of the excitation laser when the sample is removed from the integrating sphere and
P L
is the integrated photon count of the excitation laser when the sample is mounted in the integrating sphere and hit by the beam. A set of neutral-density filters were used to vary excitation density. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements were performed using a Horiba Fluorolog time-correlated single-photon counting system with photomultiplier tube detectors. A pulsed laser diode (532 nm, 110–140 ps pulse width) was used as excitation source for steady-state and transient measurements. For transient measurements, a 160 ns period (0.28 nJ per pulse) was used to capture accurate carrier lifetimes. IPES and UPS For combined UPS and IPES measurements, an Excitech H Lyman-α photon source (10.2 eV) with an oxygen-filled beam path was used for excitation, coupled to a PHI 5600 ultrahigh vacuum system with a hemispherical electron energy analyser. A sample bias of −5 V and pass energy of 5.85 eV were used for UPS acquisition. IPES measurements were performed in Bremsstrahlung isochromat mode with electron kinetic energy below 5 eV and an emission current of 2 μA to minimize sample damage. A Kimball Physics ELG-2 electron gun with a BaO cathode was used to generate the electron beam, and emitted photons were collected with a bandpass photon detector that included an optical bandpass filter (280 nm for 3-fluoro-phenethylammonium (3F-PEA) and BA-treated films and 254 nm for control and phenethylammonium (PEA)-treated films) and a photomultiplier tube (R585, Hamamatsu Photonics). Samples were held at a −20 V bias during all IPES measurements and the UHV chamber was blacked out to exclude external light. Perovskite films sent for combined UPS/IPES were fabricated on ITO/NiO x /Me-4PACz substrates. Transient photovoltage and photocurrent These measurements were carried out according to ref.
50 . KPFM Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) images were generated using an Asylum Cypher S atomic force microscope (Oxford Instruments) with a Ti-Ir-coated ASYELEC.01-R2 cantilever and
k  = 4 ± 0.5 N m –1
(Asylum Research). Scans were performed over 2 µm at 512 pixels and 0.5 Hz in a two-pass nap method, the first pass in tapping mode and the second in KPFM mode with a tip potential of 5 V and surface clearance of 5 nm. Cantilever calibration was performed using the Asylum Research GetReal database. Hyperspectral imaging Perovskite films were deposited on HTL/ITO films using the same method as for device fabrication, and the C 60
film was evaporated on top of the perovskite films to deliver a
pin
device stack. Absolute PL spectra of encapsulated samples were collected using a hyperspectral imaging system coupled to a microscope with 2 nm spectral resolution (Photon etc. IMA). Samples were excited from the top surface of perovskite (and C 60
layer) with a 405 nm laser at around 1 sun illumination 51 . The absolute calibration procedure of the setup is reported in detail elsewhere 52 . The collected data were analysed by home-built MatLab code using modified Würfel’s generalized Plank law to acquire QFLS, ∆ μ
(refs.
53 , 54 , 55 , 56 ): $${\varphi }_{(E,\theta )}={A}_{(E,\theta )}\frac{\cos \theta }{4{{\rm{\pi }}}^{3}{\hbar }^{3}{c}_{0}^{2}}{E}^{2}\frac{1}{\exp \left(\frac{E-\triangle \mu }{{k}_{{\rm{B}}}T}\right)-1}$$ where
\({A}_{(E,\theta )}\)
is the absorption probability of a photon with energy
E , incident at angle
\(\theta \)
with respect to the normal surface;
k B T
is the Boltzmann constant and temperature (equivalent to 25.7 meV at room temperature). Here, the
\(\cos \theta \)
factor represents emission from the surface following Lambert’s law. Finally, fitting is applied to each data cube to construct the images with two-pixel averaging, giving a spatial resolution of about 0.6 µm per pixel. SEM High-resolution SEM images were obtained using a Hitachi S5200 microscope with an accelerating voltage of 1.5 kV. A low accelerating voltage and low beam current were deployed to reduce surface damage of perovskite films under electron beam bombardment. Pseudo- J–V
curves Pseudo- J–V
curves were plotted based on intensity-dependent PLQY measurements. First, QFLS is calculated based on PLQY values at various excitation light intensities: $${\rm{Q}}{\rm{F}}{\rm{L}}{\rm{S}}={k}_{{\rm{B}}}T\times {\rm{l}}{\rm{n}}({\rm{P}}{\rm{L}}{\rm{Q}}{\rm{Y}}\times \,{S\times J}_{{\rm{G}}}/{J}_{0,{\rm{r}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{d}}})$$ where
S
is sun-equivalent excitation intensity,
J G
the current density generated at 1 sun (taken from device
J SC ) and
J 0,rad
the radiative recombination current in the dark (taken from the dark current value from Shockley–Queisser limit). Because the current density generated is proportional to excitation light intensity, an exponential current–QFLS curve is created that ideally follows the same functional dependence on voltage as the dark current–voltage curve of a diode with no series resistance. Subtracting this from a charge generation current density at 1 sun ( J G ) creates a
pJ–V
curve that is limited by nonradiative recombination processes in the cell, but not by transport and/or series resistance. DFT calculations All density functional theory (DFT) calculations were done using FHI-aims code 57 , 58 , 59 . Default numerical settings, referred to as ‘intermediate’ in FHI-aims, were used. Local minimum-energy geometries of Born–Oppenheimer surfaces were obtained with residual total energy gradients below 1 × 10 −2  eV Å –1
for atomic positions, by the PBE–generalized gradient approximation functional 60
within the Van der Waals corrections, followed by the Tkatcheko–Scheffler (TS) 61
method. DOS is calculated by the PBE–generalized gradient approximation functional, including spin-orbit coupling effects 62 , within a k-point grid of 2 × 2 × 1 to sample the Brillouin zone corresponding to the unit cell shown in Supplementary Fig.
7b,c . To mimic the experimental composition Cs 0.2 FA 0.8 Pb(I 0.6 Br 0.4 ) 3 , an alloyed structure was first built using a 2 × 2 × 2 supercell based on cubic phase conventional cells (Supplementary Fig.
7a ) within Cs 0.25 FA 0.75 Pb(I 0.584 Br 0.416 ) 3 . Next, the slab structures (Supplementary Fig.
7b,c ) with total
c  axis set to 100 Å were built based on these PBE + TS relaxed alloyed structures in a 1 × 1 × 3 supercell for Pb-I-terminated and (FA, Cs)-I-terminated surfaces. Detailed surface configurations are very important for prediction of work function tunability, which will be largely affected by surface terminations and defects. As a result, three different surface configurations (perfect surface, surface with one iodine vacancy (V I ) and surface with one bromine vacancy (V Br )) are considered for Pb-I terminations. On the other hand, five different surface configurations (perfect surface, surface with one Cs vacancy (V Cs ), surface with one FA vacancy (V FA ), surface with one iodine vacancy (V I ) and surface with one bromine vacancy (V Br )) are considered for (FA, Cs)-I terminations. In all geometry relaxations for the slab, the bottom three layers of atoms are fixed to mimic the bulk environment and the atomic positions of all atoms besides these three layers are relaxed by PBE + TS. Based on these relaxed slab structures, we can calculate the work function changes resulting from PDA treatment according to the electrostatic potential difference between the treated surface (ligands on top; Supplementary Fig.
8b
(bottom)) and untreated surface (Supplementary Fig.
8b
(top)), as shown in Supplementary Fig.
8c . Among different surface configurations (Supplementary Fig.
8a ), the Pb-I-terminated surface with V Br
provides the closest agreement for Δ W
after PDA treatment (theoretically calculated value, 0.44 eV) with the experimental UPS data (experimental result, 0.1 eV; Fig.
1c ). Next, detailed DOS comparison is used to elucidate potential changes to surface states after PDA treatment and their corresponding n-/p-doping effects. In DOS comparison plots, the contribution from the third-bottom fixed Pb-I layers in the slab (Supplementary Fig.
7c ) is used to align DOS positions to the bulk case (Supplementary Fig.
9 ). Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the  Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary

Abstract Organic halide salt passivation is considered to be an essential strategy to reduce defects in state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells (PSCs). This strategy, however, suffers from the inevitable formation of in-plane favored two-dimensional (2D) perovskite layers with impaired charge transport, especially under thermal conditions, impeding photovoltaic performance and device scale-up. To overcome this limitation, we studied the energy barrier of 2D perovskite formation from
ortho- ,
meta-
and
para- isomers of (phenylene)di(ethylammonium) iodide (PDEAI 2 ) that were designed for tailored defect passivation. Treatment with the most sterically hindered
ortho -isomer not only prevents the formation of surficial 2D perovskite film, even at elevated temperatures, but also maximizes the passivation effect on both shallow- and deep-level defects. The ensuing PSCs achieve an efficiency of 23.9% with long-term operational stability (over 1000 h). Importantly, a record efficiency of 21.4% for the perovskite module with an active area of 26 cm 2
was achieved.

Introduction As the front runner among emerging photovoltaic technologies, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 25% show great promise for scale-up and future commercialization due to relatively simple and low-cost solution processes 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . However, the disordered stoichiometric compositions at surfaces, the loss of organic components during thermal annealing, and the heterogeneous polycrystalline nature inevitably generate abundant defects in the solution-processed perovskite films, particularly at surfaces and grain boundaries 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 . Such defects incur electronic states in the bandgap of the perovskite and behave as non-radiative recombination centers, which shorten the carrier lifetime and limit the photovoltaic performance 9 . Moreover, these defects are responsible for local charge accumulation, accelerated ion migration, and the initial invasion of moisture or oxygen, ultimately causing device instability issues 3 . The defects also hinder the scale-up of PSCs to modules, thus restricting commercialization 10 . To address this problem, various defect reduction methods have been proposed including (i) composition tuning 11 , 12 , 13 , (ii) crystal growth regulation 14 , 15 , 16 , and (iii) surface passivation 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 . To date, surficial post-treatment by alkylammonium halides is commonly exploited to achieve efficient and stable perovskite devices, and many compounds have been evaluated 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 . Typically, an additional two-dimensional (2D) perovskite layer is formed on top of the primary perovskite absorber after treatment with alkylammonium halides, improving the stability of the devices 8 , 25 , 26 . A stubborn in-plane orientation and high exciton binding energy are usually observed for the surficial 2D perovskite layer, which potentially suppresses charge transport and draws back the passivation effect, especially when using bulkier spacer cations 27 , 28 , 29 . For this reason, recently, You et al. removed the annealing process after post-treatment to enable a thin phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI) layer instead of a 2D perovskite layer for more effective surface passivation 30 . As a result, they achieved a certified PCE of over 23%, benefiting from a combination of promotion of charge transport by the
π -conjugated phenyl rings, reduction of Pb 2+
interstitials through amine coordination, and filling of iodine vacancies by iodide ions 17 . However, these devices still suffered from a plummet in PCE under higher operating temperatures due to the conversion of PEAI to 2D PEA 2 PbI 4 . Therefore, an alkylammonium halide that can sustain higher temperatures without undergoing 2D perovskite formation is highly desirable to effectively passivate surface defects for efficient and stable PSCs and modules. Herein, we describe surface passivation of perovskite films using
ortho -(phenylene)di(ethylammonium) iodide ( o -PDEAI 2 ) that leads to high-performance PSCs and modules. From an investigation of the
ortho -,
meta- , and
para- isomers for PDEAI 2 , the
ortho -isomer effectively increases the energy barrier of the 2D perovskite formation and prevents the bulky organic cations from entering the perovskite lattice even at elevated temperatures. Surficial
o -PDEAI 2
exhibits a comprehensive passivation effect on both shallow- and deep-level defects, which suppresses non-radiative recombination and improves interfacial charge extraction, resulting in a PCE of 23.9% in PSCs with enhanced long-term stability at ambient and elevated temperatures, and light-soaking conditions. Furthermore, a
o -PDEAI 2 -based perovskite module, with an active area of 26 cm 2 , presents a record efficiency of 21.4%. Results Isomer construction for suppressing 2D perovskite formation The
ortho -,
meta- , and
para- isomers of PDEAI 2
(Fig.  1a ) were prepared and further details are provided in the  Supplementary Information . To examine their potential to form 2D perovskites, films composed of equimolar quantities of PDEAI 2
and PbI 2
were fabricated. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the
para- PDEAI 2
( p -PDEAI 2 )-based film (Fig.  1b ) exhibit a dominant peak at
∼ 7.15° associated with (002) lattice reflections of the 2D ( p -PDEA)PbI 4
perovskite 31 , 32 . The
meta- PDEAI 2
( m -PDEAI 2 )-based film contains the same peak, but with a much lower relative intensity, implying that the 2D perovskite is formed, but to a much lower extent. The non-perovskite amorphous XRD pattern observed in the
o -PDEAI 2 -based film suggests that the 2D perovskite cannot be formed. Absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra reveal a similar trend (Fig.  1c ). The
p -PDEAI 2 -based film shows an exciton absorption around 516 nm and a PL emission around 532 nm, assigned to the characteristic peaks of 2D perovskite with layer thickness
n  = 1 33 . These optical characteristics were not observed in the
m -PDEAI 2 -based sample due to the negligible 2D component in the film. Similarly, no absorption or emission signal was identified in the region 500–600 nm for
o -PDEAI 2 -based film, indicating that the formation of 2D perovskite is disfavored. Fig. 1: Structures of PDEAI 2

and

isopropanol solutions were spin-coated onto the perovskite surface and experiments were performed to determine whether the surficial 2D perovskite is formed during the post-treatment process, especially under thermal induction. Widely used PEAI was employed for comparison. Figure  1d
displays the temperature-dependent PL spectra of perovskite films under 450 nm excitation. As the temperature increases, the films deposited with PEAI and
p -PDEAI 2
show enhanced emission in the 510–540 nm region, evidencing the growth of 2D perovskite with
n  = 1 on the film surface (Fig.  1b ). In contrast, post-treatment with
m -PDEAI 2
and
o -PDEAI 2
did not lead to the formation of surficial 2D perovskite, even at elevated temperatures. This was further confirmed by the temperature-dependent XRD (Fig.  1e
and Supplementary Fig.  2 ), where reinforced (002) reflections of 2D perovskite were observed for the
p -PDEAI 2 - and PEAI-treated films whereas no peak was observed for the other two films. The upper 2D ( p -PDEA)PbI 4
perovskite shows a lower diffraction intensity than that of the (PEA) 2 PbI 4 , which is commonly observed for other Dion-Jacobson (DJ) perovskites 31 , 34 . Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was used to probe the crystal orientation of the annealed films (Fig.  1f ). The surficial (PEA) 2 PbI 4
exhibits a combined feature of diffraction arcs and Bragg spots along the
q z
direction at 0.39 Å −1
and 0.78 Å −1 , implying a random but predominantly in-plane orientation of the (002) and (004) crystal planes. A similar orientation was observed for ( p -PDEA)PbI 4
with the characteristic (002) crystal plane at
q z  = 0.51 Å −1 . Only diffraction signals corresponding to the three-dimensional (3D) perovskite ( q z  = 1.00 Å −1 ) and excess PbI 2
( q z  = 0.91 Å −1 ) were identified for the
m -PDEAI 2 - and
o -PDEAI 2 -treated films, which is consistent with the XRD results (Supplementary Fig.  2 ). It is evident that both the monoammonium and the
para -diammonium substituents on the phenyl ring enable organic halide salts to react with PbI 2
from the underlying 3D perovskite during the post-treatment process and form an in-plane-orientation dominated 2D perovskite on the surface (Fig.  1g ). The arbitrary, especially in-plane, orientation will block the charge transport along with the inorganic framework due to the alternant insulating organic layers 35 . In contrast,
m -PDEAI 2
and
o -PDEAI 2
form a thin organic halide salt layer instead of 2D perovskite layer on the surface, which may avoid the energy disorder and the efficiency loss at elevated operating temperatures. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to understand the specific behavior of each PDEAI 2
isomer. The formation energies of 2D perovskites formed from
p -PDEAI 2 ,
m -PDEAI 2
or
o -PDEAI 2
were calculated (Fig.  2a
and Supplementary Table  1 ). The formation of 2D perovskite with
p -PDEAI 2
and
m -PDEAI 2
are energetically more favorable than
o -PDEAI 2 . For comparison, the formation energy of 2D perovskite formed from PEAI was also calculated to be −7.71 eV (Supplementary Fig.  3 ), which is lower than that of PDEAI 2
isomers and consistent with experimental observation (Fig.  1d, e
and Supplementary Fig.  2 ). We further checked the possibility of the formation 2D perovskite with a larger layer thickness and calculated the reaction thermodynamics of the process with the different isomers. Supplementary Fig.  4
and Supplementary Table  1
indicate that the reactions of
p -PDEAI 2
and
m -PDEAI 2
processes are more favorable than that of
o -PDEAI 2 . This difference is due to the suitable matching between the distance of two –CH 2 –CH 2 –NH 3 +
groups of the cations and the distance of adjacent octahedral voids on the perovskite. As can be seen in Supplementary Fig.  5 , the lowest mismatching distances are 0.85, 0.15, and 1.85 Å for
p -PDEAI 2 ,
m -PDEAI 2 , and
o -PDEAI 2 , respectively. The formation of quasi-2D perovskite is also likely to be energetically costly for the
o -PDEAI 2 , which is nicely reflected by the reaction energy values. Thus, the model demonstrates that
o -PDEAI 2
possesses the highest formation energy barrier of surficial 2D perovskite among the PDEAI 2
isomers, in good agreement with the experimental observations. Fig. 2: Theoretical modeling. a

Optimized structures for the adsorption of 2D cations on the perovskite surface. The top insets indicate the maximum number of PDEA cations that can be adsorbed on a 2 × 2 perovskite surface. Schematic is based on the optimized coordinates of the corresponding structures and translating them in multiple numbers. For the
o -PDEAI 2
structures, both the modes adsorb in a similar manner. Full size image Passivation effects on photovoltaic performance In order to investigate the surface passivation effect, adsorption energies were calculated by depositing the PEA,
p -PDEA,
m -PDEA, and
o -PDEA cations on the perovskite surface considering both the ethylammonium and phenyl ring adsorption modes (Fig.  2b
and Supplementary Fig.  6 , Supplementary Table  2 ). The calculations indicate that all the cations show similar surface passivation if only adsorption of one molecule is considered. However, passivation is achieved by the cumulative effect related to the number of cations that can be adsorbed per unit surface area. The optimized structures were processed to estimate the maximum number of cations that may be adsorbed on a 2 × 2 supercell (17.7 Å 2 ) of perovskite surface, as illustrated in the insets of Fig.  2b . For the
p -PDEA cation, only 4 cations can be adsorbed, increasing to 4–6 for
m -PDEA and 6 for
o -PDEA cations. Therefore, it can be qualitatively argued that the
o -PDEA cation shows a better surface passivation effect due to the increased binding affinity and higher coverage, which may reduce the possibility of defect formation. To examine the passivation effect, we incorporated the PDEAI 2
isomers onto the perovskite film with a surficial morphology corresponding to that shown in Supplementary Fig.  7 , and the photovoltaic devices were fabricated with a typical configuration consisting of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/TiO 2 /SnO 2 /perovskite/PDEAI 2 /2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-( N , N -di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD)/Au (Fig.  3a ). Current density ( J )–voltage ( V ) characteristics of the devices are compared in Supplementary Fig.  8a
and Supplementary Table  3 . As expected, the devices with
p -PDEAI 2
show slightly lower PCEs compared to the control devices, ascribed to the high binding energy and electrical anisotropy of 2D ( p -PDEA)PbI 4
layer that hinders the charge separation and out-of-plane charge transport 29 . Interestingly, a comparatively low efficiency was observed for the
m -PDEAI 2 -based devices. This may be rationalized by the two –CH 2 –CH 2 –NH 3 +
groups of
m -PDEA anchoring at adjacent octahedral voids of the perovskite surface (Supplementary Fig.  5 ), which might cause carrier stagnation and resultant charge recombination. Among the three isomers,
o -PDEAI 2
has the best passivation effect, improving the average PCE from 20.88% of the control device to 22.41%, mainly reflected by the enhanced fill factor (FF) and open-circuit voltage ( V OC ). The effective passivation of
o -PDEAI 2
may be attributed to (i) the high adsorption density on the perovskite, (ii) the strong adsorption energy due to the diammonium structure, and (iii) the electrostatic interactions with the defective perovskite surface 17 , 36 . As a result, the best-performing PSC passivated with
o -PDEAI 2
shows a PCE of 23.92%, with a
V OC
of 1.157 V, a short-circuit current ( J SC ) of 24.75 mA cm −2 , and an FF of 83.50%, in which the concentration of the
o -PDEAI 2
was optimized to be 2 mg mL −1
(Supplementary Table  4 ), compared to the best control device with a PCE of 21.94%,
V OC
of 1.135 V,
J SC
of 24.49 mA cm −2
and FF of 79.00%. The integrated
J SC
values from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra in Supplementary Fig.  8b
matches well with those measured from the
J – V
curves (< 1% discrepancy). A stabilized power output of 23.50% and negligible hysteresis are demonstrated for the
o -PDEAI 2 -based device as shown in Fig.  3b . Also, the statistic histogram reveals good reproductivity with 75% of the devices having PCEs exceeding 22% (Fig.  3c ), confirming the effectiveness of
o -PDEAI 2
passivation. Fig. 3: Passivation layer-dependent device performance. a

Transient photocurrent decay in lateral sample geometry. Full size image To elucidate the passivation effect on the hole extraction and carrier dynamics in the devices, voltage-dependent transient PL and transient photocurrent studies were performed. Supplementary Fig.  9a–e
shows the PL decay kinetics obtained for different devices at various applied voltages. All devices show bicomponential PL decay, and the dependences of the average decay times on the applied voltage are shown in Fig.  3d . The applied voltage reduces the average decay times, indicating that they are at least partly determined by the carrier extraction. The average decay times anticorrelate with the device efficiency and particularly with FFs, where the devices with faster PL decays show better performance. Specifically,
o -PDEAI 2
passivation causes the fastest PL decay attributed to the improved hole extraction, whereas the
m -PDEAI 2
passivated film shows much slower PL decay, which indicates impaired hole extraction deteriorating the device performance 37 . To exclude the influence of the built-in electric field present in solar cells, we have additionally investigated the PL decays in the treated with PDEAI 2
and nontreated perovskite films covered with spiro-OMeTAD deposited on glass substrates (see Supplementary Fig.  9f
for kinetics and Supplementary Table  5
for bi-exponential fitting parameters). For comparison, we have also investigated a pure nontreated perovskite film, which showed a long lifetime of 284 ns indicating a high material quality 38 . The spiro-OMeTAD layer significantly shortens the PL decay due to efficient hole extraction. Passivation with the different PDEAI 2
isomers shows qualitatively similar results as for the complete devices confirming their influence on the hole extraction rate. The carrier extraction dynamics were revealed by transient photocurrent measurements. Due to the high capacitance of the devices restricting the time resolution of photocurrent measurements, the carrier extraction investigations were performed in integral mode measuring discharging of the device capacitance by photocurrents, when voltage was applied through a high (1 kΩ) resistor. The signal growth, in this case, corresponds to the cumulated extracted charge. Figure  3e
shows the normalized charge extraction kinetics under an applied voltage of 1 V. The
o -PDEAI 2 -passivated device shows the fastest carrier extraction of <0.2 μs. (The partial signal drop during about 0.4–2.0 μs is caused by the sample recharging by the capacitance from the external circuit.) The control device shows similarly fast initial extraction, however, an additional slow extraction component is also observed. Significantly slower charge extraction from the
m -PDEAI 2 -treated device is in good agreement with the PL decay data. We further addressed the role of PDEAI 2
passivation by investigating transient photocurrent kinetics in lateral sample geometry. The perovskite films were formed on an interdigitated comb of Pt electrodes (IDE) with 5 μm interelectrode distances and a spiro-MeOTAD layer was deposited on top of perovskite films. Due to the large, 5 μm interelectrode distance, the carrier extraction was slow. We also used low excitation intensity, when carrier recombination could be ignored. In these conditions, the photocurrent kinetics on a sub-microsecond time scale was mainly determined by the carrier trapping and by the hole extraction to hole transport layer (HTL) 39 . The control device with HTL shows faster photocurrent decay than that without HTL during initial ~50 ns due to the hole extraction (Fig.  3f ). The influence of PDEAI 2
treatment is expected to be bilateral: passivation of surface traps shall cause slower photocurrent decay, and modification of the hole extraction rate may cause additional photocurrent changes. Indeed, all passivated samples show slower photocurrent decay indicating reduced carrier trapping. The
m -PDEAI 2 -treated sample shows particularly slow decay, apparently because of reduced carrier trapping and the prevented hole extraction. While the
o -PDEAI 2 -treated sample shows similar slow carrier decay during initial ~20 ns, due to reduced carrier trapping, but at longer times the photocurrent decays faster attributed to the improved hole extraction. The overall transient PL and photocurrent results provide indications of interfacial trap passivation by the PDEAI 2
isomers and also demonstrate that
o -PDEAI 2
treatment reduces the carrier transfer barrier at the perovskite/HTL junction and effectively increases the hole extraction rate contributing to the FF enhancement of PSCs. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was used to understand the surface energy band structure with and without
o -PDEAI 2 . The work function is determined to be −4.45 eV and −4.91 eV for the pristine perovskite surface and the
o -PDEAI 2
passivated surface, respectively (Supplementary Fig.  10 ). This shift is in accordance with the change in surface potential probed by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) as reflected in Fig.  4a . The
o -PDEAI 2 -passivated surface exhibits a lower average electronic chemical potential (0.16 mV) than that of the control (0.33 mV). The downshifted energy level suggests a less
n -type surface after
o -PDEAI 2
treatment, which causes upwards band bending and improves hole transport and extraction for higher
V OC
values 40 , 41 . Confocal PL microscopy mapping was applied to probe the homogeneity of perovskite films. The film with
o -PDEAI 2
presents more uniform PL emission compared to the control film, indicating less surface defect densities (Fig.  4b ). This is also revealed by the cathodoluminescence (CL) intensity maps, where a more homogeneous distribution was demonstrated for the film with
o -PDEAI 2
passivation (Fig.  4c ). To complement these data the corresponding CL spectra (Supplementary Fig.  11 ) confirm that
o -PDEAI 2
treatment does not induce 2D perovskite formation on the surface and the CL peaks at around 508 nm may be assigned to the presence of excess PbI 2
in both films. To confirm the presence of
o -PDEAI 2
on the perovskite surface, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed. The high-resolution XPS patterns of C 1 s
(Supplementary Fig.  12 ) show an emerging peak at ~291.0 eV, corresponding to the conjugated π–π bonding of the phenyl group in
o -PDEAI 2 30 . The XPS pattern of Pb 4 f
for the control film displays two dominant peaks located at 138. 8 and 143.7 eV, assigned to the Pb 4 f 7/2
and Pb 4 f 5/2 , respectively (Fig.  4d ), which shift to 139.1 and 144.0 eV for the film with
o -PDEAI 2 . This shift to higher binding energies reflects the modified electronic states of the perovskite atoms due to interactions between
o -PDEAI 2
and the perovskite surface 41 . In addition, another two peaks located at 137.0 and 141.9 eV arising from the metallic Pb were observed in the control film, which were not observed in the passivated film. This implies that
o -PDEAI 2
can combine with under-coordinated Pb 2+
ions and thereby avoid the formation of metallic Pb, thus restraining the ionic defects and improving the operational stability of the PSCs 42 . To quantify the passivation effect of
o -PDEAI 2 , a Mott–Schottky analysis and trap density of states (tDOS) measurements were conducted on the complete devices. As indicated in Fig.  4e , the higher built-in potential (1.146 vs 1.121 V) and lower interfacial charge density (2.73 × 10 15
vs 3.50 × 10 15  cm −3 ) for the
o -PDEAI 2 -passivated device demonstrates that the
o -PDEAI 2
layer can enhance the driving force of carrier injection and reduce the recombination losses at the interface 10 . The tDOS distribution under each energy demarcation was characterized as shown in Fig.  4f . The charging and discharging of trap states within the bandgap contributes to a larger variation in capacitance with the change of frequencies. Thus, the frequency differential capacitance can disclose the defects at certain energy demarcations 43 . It was found that the control device has higher trap densities of 10 19 –10 21  m −3  eV −1
over three trap bands. After
o -PDEAI 2
treatment, the tDOS was reduced over the entire energy region, to 10 18 –10 20  m −3  eV −1 , confirming that the
o -PDEAI 2
effectively passivate the defects with both shallow and deep energy levels on the surface of perovskite film. Fig. 4: Characterization of the perovskite films and interface with

o -PDEAI 2
by fabricating a perovskite solar module with a total active area of 26.00 cm 2
(Fig.  5a ). The module was completed by laser etching with 9 subcells in series and the interconnection is schematically illustrated in Fig.  5b . Encouragingly, the perovskite solar module based on
o -PDEAI 2
passivation exhibits a
V OC
of 10.30 V, a
J SC
of 2.71 mA cm −2 , an FF of 76.40%, and a PCE of 21.36% (Fig.  5c
and Supplementary Fig.  13 ), which corresponds to a designated-area efficiency of 19.27%. This is one of the highest efficiencies reported so far for perovskite solar modules (Supplementary Table  6 ) 44 . The high module performance originates from the good uniformity of the perovskite layer, the reduced trap density, and suppressed interfacial recombination, confirming the utility of the
o -PDEAI 2
passivation strategy for scale-up of PSCs. Fig. 5: Module performance and long-term stability of the PSCs. a

Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) for 1100 h of the unencapsulated devices under continuous light (100 mW cm −2 ) illumination at 25 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere. Full size image Shelf life and operational stability Long-term stability tests were carried out to study the influence of
o -PDEAI 2
layer on device stability. The PCEs of the unencapsulated devices under a RH of 40–50% were first tracked over time (Fig.  5d ). The control device maintains 58% of the initial PCE (20.82%) after 1008 h, compared to that of 85% for the
o -PDEAI 2
passivated device with an initial efficiency of 22.65%. The thermal stability was also evaluated by heating the perovskite films and corresponding devices at 85 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere. As shown in Fig.  5e , the
o -PDEAI 2
passivated device (initial PCE 22.38%) degrades by 25% over 1000 h, compared to a 49% decrease for the control device (initial PCE 20.32%). Interestingly, an efficiency plummet is not observed at the start of the annealing process. That is, the suppression of converting
o -PDEAI 2
into 2D perovskite effectively retains the passivation effect under constant heating, and avoids the PCE drop at the initial stage, which was normally observed in the widely used PEAI passivation 30 . XRD tracking shows that the thermal degradation of these perovskite films results from the decomposition of the perovskite material (Fig.  5f ). The control film shows an increase in the intensity of the peaks that correspond to PbI 2 , whereas decomposition is retarded after
o -PDEAI 2
passivation, indicating the
o -PDEAI 2
passivation layer reduces the release of volatile organic components and enhances the resistance to heat of the perovskite material 45 . The continuous performance of the unencapsulated PSCs was also examined by MPPT under 1 sun illumination in an inert atmosphere (Fig.  5g ). The device passivated with
o -PDEAI 2
exhibits enhanced light stability, maintaining >90% of its original PCE after 1100 h, outperforming the control device, which degrades to >60% of the initial PCE. The robust ambient and operational stability of the
o -PDEAI 2 -based device may be attributed to the hydrophobicity of the phenyl group, the mitigated interfacial charge accumulation, and the suppressed ion migration benefiting from the passivation of defects 46 , 47 . Discussion We demonstrate that
o -PDEAI 2
is an effective passivation agent which affords highly efficient and stable PSCs. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that locating the two ammonium cations in the most sterically hindered
ortho
position endows
o -PDEAI 2
with an energy barrier for the formation of the in-plane favored 2D perovskite together with stronger defect passivation effects compared to the other structural isomers, to significantly reduce interfacial charge recombination. Passivation with
o -PDEAI 2
boosts the efficiency of PSCs and modules (active area of 26 cm 2 ) to 23.9% and 21.4%, respectively, while ensuring long-term stabilities over 1000 h. This study demonstrates that altering functional groups and chemical structures should be an effective strategy to develop novel organic cation passivators with continuous and stable passivation effect, which may pave the way for scaling up perovskite photovoltaics to sizes of commercial relevance. Methods Device fabrication The TiO 2
compact (c-TiO 2 ) layer was deposited onto the cleaned FTO (Nippon Sheet Glass, TEC8) substrates by spray pyrolysis of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75 wt.% in isopropanol, Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in anhydrous isopropanol (99.8%, Acros Organics) with 1:20 volume ratio at 450 °C and then annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. TiO 2
paste (30NR-D, GreatCell Solar) was diluted in anhydrous ethanol (99.8%, Acros Organics) with a weight ratio of 1:10 and spin-coated onto substrates at 3000 rpm for 20 s. The films were then annealed at 500 °C for 30 min in air. After cooling, 0.1 M SnCl 4
(99%, Acros Organics) aqueous solution was deposited on the substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The films were then dried at 190 °C for 1 h and transferred into a nitrogen glovebox. 1.45 M perovskite precursors (PbI 2 :PbBr 2 :FAI:MAI:CsI:MACl = 0.98:0.02:0.81:0.04:0.05:0.20) were dissolved in the mixed DMF (99.8%, Acros Organics): DMSO (99.7%, Acros Organics) = 4:1 (volume ratio) solvent. The perovskite solution was spin-coated on substrates at 1000 rpm for 12 s and 5000 rpm for 28 s, respectively. 200 µL of chlorobenzene (99.8%, Acros Organics) was dropped onto the spinning films at 15 s before the end of the second step, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min and 150 °C for 10 min. For the post treatment, phenyldiethylammonium iodide (PDEAI 2 ) solutions in anhydrous isopropanol (99.8%, Acros Organics) were deposited on the perovskite films at 4000 rpm for 20 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 5 min. 0.06 M spiro-OMeTAD was dissolved in chlorobenzene (99.8%, Acros Organics), adding 0.2 M 4- tert -Butylpyridine (98%, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.03 M bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-imide lithium salt (LiTFSI, 99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich) in acetonitrile (99.9%, Acros Organics) and 0.0035 M FK209 Co(III) TFSI salt (GreatCell Solar) in acetonitrile (99.9%, Acros Organics). The spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 20 s, followed by thermal evaporation of a 70 nm gold electrode under a high vacuum. For module fabrication, 6.5 cm × 7 cm FTO substrates were patterned by laser with nine subcells connected in series. The film deposition processes were the same as the normal solar cells as described above. The geometric fill factor (GFF) was calculated to be 90.2%, which was defined as the active area divided by the designated area. Characterization The GIWAXS was measured with a photon energy of 8.03 keV (1.55 Å) at an incident angle of 0.3°. PL decay kinetics were measured using the Edinburgh Instruments time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) fluorescence spectrometer F900. Voltage-dependent PL decay measurements were performed by varying the reverse bias voltage applied to the cell from 0 to 2.5 V in steps of 0.5 V and simultaneously measuring the PL lifetime at each voltage. The PL decay kinetics were fitted using the intensity-weighted double exponential functions ( \(\bar{\tau }={\sum }_{i=1}^{2}{{A}_{i}{\tau }_{i}}^{2}/{\sum }_{i=1}^{2}{A}_{i}{\tau }_{i}\) ) to estimate the average lifetimes. The KPFM images were acquired using an MFP-3D Infinity with AC bias modulation at 7.5KHz and 4 V amplitude in ambient. The UPS was measured by an AXIS Nova spectrometer (Kratos Analytical Ltd, UK) with a He-I source (21.22 eV). The XPS was examined by VersaProbe II (Physical Electronics Inc.) with an Al-Ka source of 1486.6 eV. The micro-PL maps were obtained with an Acton Standard Series SP-2558 laser confocal Raman spectrometer (Princeton Instruments), a digital CCD (PIXIS:100B_eXcelon), and a 485 nm laser (PicoQuant LDH-P-C-485). CL measurements were performed on the Attolight ROSA 4634 CL SEM at 1 kV and 50 nm per pixel for the image of 128 × 128 pixels. J – V
characteristics of the devices were characterized by a commercial solar simulator (Oriel, 450 W xenon, AAA class) combined with a Keithley 2400 source meter at room temperature in air. The light intensity was calibrated before each measurement with a Si reference cell (KG5, Newport) to match with the AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm −2 ) standard. The voltage scan rate and scan steps were 125 mV s −1
and 10 mV, respectively. No light soaking or voltage bias was applied before the measurement and the active area of the cells was defined by a black metal mask with a square aperture of the area of 0.09 cm 2 . For solar modules, the voltage scan rate was 5 V s −1
and scan steps were 50 mV, and the active area is 26 cm 2 . The statistics of PCEs for devices were obtained from 20 samples for each condition. The EQE spectra were recorded with an IQE200B (Oriel). The stability test was conducted under 100 mW cm −2
LED illumination at 25 °C and the devices were sealed in a cell holder flushed with a N 2
flow of ~30 mL min −1 . For the humidity test, the unsealed solar cells were kept in the ambient of 40–50% RH monitored by a hygrometer at room temperature in the dark. For the thermal stability test, the solar cells were kept at 85 °C in nitrogen under dark conditions. Transient photocurrent measurements were performed with an Agilent Technologies DS05054A oscilloscope using a 1 kΩ input resistor and a Tektronix AFG 3101 function generator. The Mott–Schottky curve was recorded with an SP-200 potentiostat (BioLogic). Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the  Nature Research Reporting Summary

Abstract The performance of perovskite solar cells is predominantly limited by non-radiative recombination, either through trap-assisted recombination in the absorber layer or via minority carrier recombination at the perovskite/transport layer interfaces. Here, we use transient and absolute photoluminescence imaging to visualize all non-radiative recombination pathways in planar pin - type perovskite solar cells with undoped organic charge transport layers. We find significant quasi-Fermi-level splitting losses (135 meV) in the perovskite bulk, whereas interfacial recombination results in an additional free energy loss of 80 meV at each individual interface, which limits the open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of the complete cell to ~1.12 V. Inserting ultrathin interlayers between the perovskite and transport layers leads to a substantial reduction of these interfacial losses at both the p and n contacts. Using this knowledge and approach, we demonstrate reproducible dopant-free 1 cm 2
perovskite solar cells surpassing 20% efficiency (19.83% certified) with stabilized power output, a high
V OC
(1.17 V) and record fill factor (>81%).

Main The solution processability and potential for simple manufacturing from earth-abundant materials drives research into perovskite solar cells in the search for cheap, printable photovoltaic devices. The discovery that perovskites effectively sensitize titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) in dye-sensitized solar cells in 2009 1 , and the demonstration of the first thin-film solid-state perovskite solar cells in 2012 2 , 3
has spurred tremendous research efforts concerning the understanding and optimization of perovskite-based optoelectronic devices. Though power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar cells 4
are rapidly approaching industrially engineered silicon and inorganic thin-film solar cells 5 , several key issues remain that need to be understood and overcome. These include fundamental questions regarding recombination losses 6 , long-term stability 7
and difficulties in scaling to large electrode areas 8 . Today it is well known that to unlock the full thermodynamic potential of perovskite solar cells it is imperative to suppress all non-radiative recombination losses, which manifest as increased dark currents and ideality factors greater than one, limiting both the cells’ open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) and fill factor 6 , 9 . One of the most challenging tasks in this regard is being able to pinpoint the origin of these losses in a complete device under operational conditions. In general, recombination losses may occur either in the perovskite bulk 4 , 6 , 10
or close to the interface of an adjacent transport layer as a result of a higher density of trap states at the surface 11 , 12 . Likewise, recombination may also occur across interfaces 13 , 14 , 15
between charges in the transport layer and minority carriers in the perovskite, or in the transport layers themselves 15 . The situation becomes more challenging for cells with a comparatively large area (for example, 1 cm 2 ), where additional losses come from inhomogeneities of the active perovskite absorber as well as at the interfaces to the transport layers, with transport resistances also becoming an issue 8 . Knowing the origin of the non-radiative recombination losses would greatly facilitate targeted improvements in device performance 13 . This is particularly relevant for planar perovskite devices in the pin configuration, which still lag behind the most efficient nip cells 4 , 11 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19
due to their lower open-circuit voltage and higher non-radiative recombination losses (for example, 1.15 V for record pin cells 11
compared to more than 1.23 V for nip cells 13 , 17 ). Nevertheless, pin - type cells are very attractive for single-junction solar cells as they require only ultrathin undoped charge transport layers (for example, 8 nm poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA), 30 nm C 60 ) 9
without the need for extensive chemical doping 9
and annealing at temperatures above 100 °C. This renders their fabrication compatible with roll-to-roll deposition on flexible plastic substrates. Moreover, a pin perovskite device architecture is required for Si/perovskite tandem applications in combination with well-established solar cell technologies based on p-type silicon 20 , 21 . Thus, a detailed investigation of non-radiative recombination losses and which interface represents the bottleneck for cell efficiency is urgently needed. We use a combination of steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL and TRPL) measurements to pinpoint the origin of non-radiative recombination losses in pin-type perosvkite solar cells. In particular, we determine the recombination kinetics and quasi-Fermi-level splitting (QFLS) in sample stacks consisting of the perovskite absorber-only, and perovskite/charge transport layer heterojunctions on length scales relevant to our solar cells (1 cm 2 ). We identify the main limitation to higher performance to be minority carrier recombination at the heterojunction with the organic charge transport layers. These losses are found to be surprisingly similar at the electron- and hole-selective interfaces. We therefore optimized the hole-selective interface through the use of a conjugated polyelectrolyte, which almost entirely suppressed interfacial recombination while simultaneously improving the wetting of the perovskite solution on the hole transport layer surface, delivering reproducible 1 cm 2
devices. With the knowledge that the
V OC
of the final device is now largely defined by the QFLS of the inferior perovskite/C 60
heterojunction we introduced an ultrathin layer of LiF (0.6−1 nm) between the absorber and the electron transport layer. This allowed us to reduce the interfacial recombination loss at the electron-selective interface by 35 meV. Suppressing the non-radiative recombination at both interfaces directly resulted in critical
V OC
and fill factor improvements in complete devices, allowing 1 cm 2
cells with ~20% efficiency, stabilized maximum power output and high reproducibility. This is currently the highest certified efficiency for a published 1 cm 2
perovskite solar cell structure. Last, numerical simulations highlight the importance of interface optimizations versus bulk optimizations for further perovskite solar cell developments. Device architecture Our work builds on recent advancements in the understanding and improvement of pin devices 11 , 19 , 22 . The chemical structures of PTAA, perovskite and C 60
as used in our standard cells with architecture [(indium tin oxide, ITO (150 nm)/PTAA (8 nm)/perovskite (400–500 nm)/C 60
(30 nm)/bathocuproine, BCP (8 nm)/Cu (100 nm)] are shown in Fig.
1a . For the active layer material, we chose the previously reported ‘triple cation perovskite’ mixture with the composition CsPbI 0.05 [(FAPbI 3 ) 0.89 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.11 ] 0.95 , as it delivers among the best photovoltaic performance. We note that though we focus on triple cation cells we have also generalized the results to methylammonium lead iodide MAPbI 3
and caesium formamidinium lead iodide (Cs 0.05 FA 0.95 )PbI 3
absorber layers, as discussed at the end of the manuscript. Figure

Full size image One of the most important considerations for scaling the device area is the electrode architecture, due to the relatively high sheet resistance of the transparent conducting electrode (TCE) 8 . It is thus essential to minimize the distance carriers have to traverse through the comparatively high resistance electrode (that is, ITO versus copper). Figure
2a
shows the current–voltage characteristics of optimized 1 cm 2
cells with electrode widths of 8 mm and 4 mm, which demonstrate that the fill factor can be increased from 69% to 77.9% simply by reducing the width of the active area. This is also in agreement with numerical solutions of the Shockley equation for different electrode aspect ratios, as illustrated in Fig.
2b , which confirm a roughly 2% absolute efficiency gain through the fill factor (Supplementary Fig.
1 ). This approach is in principle scalable, as the rectangular cells can be connected using laser patterning 23
while the electrode width may be slightly increased using a lower-resistance ITO substrate (for instance, 10 Ω sq −1 ). Fig. 2: Optimization of electrode design. a , Experimental

a . Full size image Non-radiative recombination losses Among the most widely used and trusted techniques in the community to study the fate of photogenerated charges in perovskite solar cells is TRPL 24 , 25 . At sufficiently low fluences a mono-exponential decay is usually observed, indicative of an underlying non-radiative trap-induced recombination that gradually reduces the density of emitting species, and hence the PL signal 6 , 10 , 26 . The fluence dependence of the TRPL signals is illustrated in Supplementary Fig.
2 . Figure
3
shows the result of such an experiment on a neat perovskite film, which displays a long PL lifetime of approximately half a microsecond, comparable to previously reported 16
perovskite films on TiO 2 . Considerably longer lifetimes have been reported in exceptional cases; for example, a lifetime of 8 µs was recently realized through surface passivation of the perovskite with tri- n -octylphosphine (TOPO) 26 . As demonstrated 6 , the achievable
V OC
in the case of dominant Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination can be predicted from the monoexponential carrier lifetime ( τ SRH ). As we detail in Supplementary Note
1 , a SRH lifetime of 500 ns (as deduced from the exponential PL decay of the neat perovskite layer) should limit the open-circuit voltage to approximately 1.215 V at room temperature. The measured
V OC
of the device is significantly lower, which suggests that addition of the charge transport layers induces substantial non-radiative recombination losses. Fig. 3: Impact of transport layers on kinetics of charge recombination. Mono-exponential TRPL decay of a neat perovskite film indicating the dominance of trap-assisted recombination in the bulk or the surface. The corresponding mono-exponential lifetime is around 500 ns, potentially allowing a
V OC
of 1.215 V (see Supplementary Note
1 ) if no additional interface recombination losses were present. The TRPL signals of perovskite/transport layer heterojunctions show a bi-exponential decay, indicating rapid charge extraction and interfacial recombination on different timescales. The films were illuminated at 470 nm (~30 nJ cm –2 ) through the organic layer, and through C 60
in the case of the pin stack. Full size image Figure
3
demonstrates the large impact of the addition of charge transporting layers on the TRPL decay, which is consistent with other previously reported studies 16 . Notably, large reductions in PL lifetimes are seen independent of whether the PTAA is added between the glass and the active material or coated on top of the perovskite film (on glass), indicating that differences in perovskite morphology related to the nature of the underlying substrate are of minor importance in determining the PL lifetime (see Supplementary Fig.
3 ). Interestingly, all samples comprising one or two transport layers exhibited a similar and fast bi-exponential decay. As pointed out previously 6 , 27 , this may be due either to the rapid extraction of charges on (sub)nanosecond timescales (quenching) or increased non-radiative recombination losses—two processes that are inherently difficult to disentangle from the TRPL signal alone. However, unless one transport layer completely depletes the perovskite bulk of one carrier type, the impact of non-radiative interface recombination will still be visible in the signal. As the bulk recombination happens at rather long timescales (lifetimes of approximately 500 ns), it can be concluded that the TRPL signals from the films with the transport layers present are subjected to additional non-radiative interface recombination. Following this line of reasoning, we attribute the fast initial decay to the loss of carriers at the interfaces due to charge extraction to the transport layers and/or to interface recombination, and the second decay (for which the mono-exponential lifetimes are provided in Fig.
3 ) to interface recombination. In accordance with this, the initial decay becomes less pronounced and smeared out when increasing the excitation wavelength—that is, when light penetrates deeper into the perovskite layer (see Supplementary Fig.
2 ). The rather similar decays after the initial drop in the samples with either PTAA or C 60
indicate that the two perovskite/organic heterojunctions equally limit the
V OC
due to additional non-radiative recombination losses at the interfaces. After carriers reach a quasi-equilibrium distribution, the lifetime of the second decay ( τ II ) can be described by an equilibrium between the bulk decay time ( τ bulk ), the diffusion time to the surface
\(\left( {\frac{{4d^2}}{{{\mathrm{\pi}} ^2D}}} \right)\)
and interface loss velocity
\((S_1)\) , that is,
\(\frac{1}{{\tau _{\mathrm{II}}}} = \frac{1}{{\tau _{\mathrm{bulk}}}} + \left( {\frac{{4d^2}}{{{\mathrm{\pi}} ^2D}} + \frac{d}{{S_1}}} \right)^{ - 1}\) , where
d
is the perovskite film thickness and
D
the diffusion constant 24 , 27 . Using the bulk lifetime of 500–785 ns, a mobility of 30 cm 2  V –1  s –1
(ref.  28 ),
d  = 400 nm and the measured
τ II
value of 20–30 ns would result in an interface loss velocity of
S 1  ~ 1.6 × 10 3 –2.1 × 10 3  cm s −1
at the interface between the charge transport layer and the perovskite. However, other processes may potentially influence the TRPL signal as well, such as a decelerating charge extraction, light-soaking effects 29 , photon recycling 24 , 25 , or a graded generation profile. Thus, it is clear that though TRPL is a useful guide to recombination losses, it by no means provides a definitive mechanistic insight. Photoluminescence and QFLS A much more direct way to quantify the additional non-radiative recombination losses at the perovskite/organic interfaces is steady-state PL, as the absolute PL intensity ( I PL ) is a direct measure of the QFLS (or ∆ E F ) 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 . Here, we use hyperspectral absolute photoluminescence imaging to create depth-averaged maps of the QFLS on the neat perovskite films in comparison to multilayer samples comprising one or both types of transport layer. This approach has been recently used by El-Hajje et al. 31
to spatially resolve the opto-electronic quality of evaporated methylammonium lead iodide junctions, and to study the hole blocking of different electron transport layers. Moreover, absolute PL has been recently applied to disentangle interfacial and bulk recombination losses in nip cells by Sarritzu et al. 33 , though the QFLS was not compared to the device voltage, and thus open-circuit voltage losses were not directly quantified. As recently discussed 32 , there are different approaches to calculate ∆ E F
from absolute PL spectra, which are all based on Würfel’s generalized Planck law 30 , which describes the non-thermal radiation of a semiconductor: $$I_{{\mathrm{PL}}}\left( E \right) = \frac{{2{\mathrm{\pi}} E^2a\left( E \right)}}{{h^3c^2}}\frac{1}{{\exp \left( {\frac{{E - \mathrm{\Delta }E_{\mathrm{F}}}}{{k_{\mathrm{B}}T}} - 1} \right)}}$$
(1)
Here,
a ( E ) is the photon energy ( E )-dependent absorptivity,
c
is the speed of light,
h
is the Planck constant and
k B
is the Boltzmann constant. Under the assumption that for emission energies above the PL maximum,
a ( E ) approaches unity, equation
(1)
can be simplified to $$\ln \left( {\frac{{I_{{\mathrm{PL}}}\left( E \right)h^3c^2}}{{2{\mathrm{\pi}} E^2}}} \right) = - \frac{E}{{k_{\mathrm{B}}T}} + \frac{{\mathrm{\Delta }E_{\mathrm{F}}}}{{k_{\mathrm{B}}T}}$$
(2)
Equation
(2)
allows one to deduce ∆ E F
simply from fitting the high-energy slope of the PL emission 36 . By applying equation
(2)
to every spectrum associated with each pixel (10 µm in diameter) of the hyperspectral images, ∆ E F
distribution maps can be created. Figure
4
shows the depth-averaged QFLS maps (1 cm 2 ) of the neat triple cation perovskite film, with either PTAA or C 60
alone, or both transport layers being present. The perovskite absorber exhibits a homogenous profile with a QFLS of approximately 1.21 eV (we note a 20 meV global systematic error on all maps). Though this value is remarkably close to the
V OC
obtained from the TRPL lifetime according to Supplementary Note
1 , it is substantially below the radiative
V OC
of approximately 1.345 eV. The latter was estimated from the dark generation current
J 0,rad
≈ 4 × 10 –21  A cm − 2
(see Supplementary Fig.
4 ). This approach for calculating the radiative
V OC
limit has been extensively applied to perovskite solar cells, as shown in refs  37 , 38 , 39 , and dates back to Shockley and Queisser 40 . We also note that the emitted PL can be influenced by photon recycling 24 , 25 . However, this does not affect our conclusions, because it is the external PL quantum yield that determines the QFLS and maximum achievable device
V OC
(ref.  41 ). Figure

also shows that the QFLS of the perovskite/C 60
film is reduced to approximately 1.136 eV ± 10 mV and the PTAA/perovskite film exhibits a QFLS of approximately 1.125 eV ± 10 mV. It is important to note that, compared to the neat absorber material with a PL quantum yield of ~0.5%, addition of PTAA or C 60
results in a large reduction of the average photoluminescence efficiency (for example, 0.017% for a perovskite/C 60
film), which also means a large increase in the non-radiative loss current (approximately 30-fold in case of perovskite/C 60
compared to the neat absorber material). Yet, despite the different nature of these two interfaces, the non-radiative recombination losses at both interfaces are surprisingly similar (lowering the QFLS by ~80 meV compared to the neat absorber), which is consistent with the TRPL results. For the (unoptimized) pin stack (glass/PTAA/perovskite/C 60 ) we obtain a ∆ E F
of approximately 1.121 V ± 10 mV, which perfectly matches the average
V OC
in complete cells under comparable illumination intensities (see below). Interestingly, this value lies only slightly below the QFLS of samples with only one transport layer present, which indicates that the non-radiative recombination losses at each individual interface are both reducing the
I PL ( E ), yet the QFLS only through the logarithm in equation
(2) . We also note a good reproducibility and homogeneity of the QFLS on the neat perovskite film and all films with C 60 , except for the glass/PTAA/perovskite heterojunctions, for which we observed a relatively large batch-to-batch variation (with the average QFLS ranging from 1.09 eV to 1.16 eV, see Supplementary Table
1 ). On the other hand, no difference in the QFLS was observed between a PTAA/perovskite film on a glass or an ITO substrate, which suggests no additional non-radiative recombination losses at the ITO/PTAA interface (see Supplementary Fig.
5 ). Fig. 4: Visualization of non-radiative interfacial recombination through absolute photoluminescence imaging. a , b , Quasi-Fermi level splitting maps (1 cm 2 ) ( a ) and corresponding energy histograms ( b ) on perovskite-only, perovskite/C 60 , PTAA/perovskite and PTAA/perovskite/C 60
films on glass. The neat perovskite absorber allows a QFLS (and thus potential
V OC ) of approximately 1.208 eV (at 300 K), which is consistent with the transient photoluminescence decay (Fig.
3 ) but significantly below the QFLS in the radiative limit (1.345 eV), as indicated by the arrow. Addition of only one transport layer (either PTAA or C 60 ) induces additional non-radiative recombination pathways, which lower the QFLS to approximately 1.125–1.135 eV. The pin junction with both transport layers adjacent to the perovskite absorber still has an average QFLS of approximately 1.121 eV. The arrow shows that interfacial recombination dominates the non-radiative recombination losses in the stack. The films were excited at 450 nm with a 1 Sun equivalent intensity and the histograms were recorded on 5 mm × 5 mm squares in the middle of the films without edge effects (PL quenching) due to the encapsulation glue, as visible in samples 1, 3 and 4. Full size image Though Fig.
4
shows that the perovskite absorber imposes a substantial limitation on the
V OC , we would expect that it is the weakest component of the (pin) stack that dominates the non-radiative loss current and sets the upper limit for the device
V OC
(in our case both interfaces equally). To further clarify the importance of interfacial optimizations in relation to bulk optimizations depending on the selectivity of the interlayers, we numerically simulated the open-circuit voltage of a pin device stack by varying the interface recombination velocities and the bulk lifetime using a drift-diffusion simulator (Supplementary Fig.
6 ) 42 . Applying the measured interface-recombination velocity in our structures before optimization (that is, ~2,000 cm s −1 ) and bulk lifetime (500 ns) as input parameters, the simulation accurately describes the
V OC
of our standard cells. The simulations clearly show that even if we improved the perovskite bulk lifetime multiple times (to much greater than 500 ns), no
V OC
improvements are possible when the interface recombination velocities stay at 2,000 cm s −1 . We therefore conclude that the
V OC
of our cells is entirely limited by the interfaces, and any improvement of the bulk would be lost due to rapid interfacial recombination. Thus, it is essential to systematically improve the interfaces, as we discuss in the following. Suppression of interfacial recombination Following the approach proposed by Lee et al. 43
to improve the wettability of hydrophobic charge transport layers, we functionalized the PTAA layer with the interface compatibilizer poly[(9,9-bis(30-((N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium)-propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] dibromide (PFN-P2)—a conjugated polyelectrolyte (CPE). In line with their findings 43 , the amphiphilic properties of PFN-P2 improved the wetting of the perovskite film on the hydrophobic PTAA, thus greatly enhancing the fabrication yield of our cells without frequent pinhole formation. To reveal possible changes of the layer morphology as a function of the underlying substrate, we performed top and cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements of perovskite films deposited on glass, glass/ITO/PTAA and glass/ITO/PTAA/PFN-P2. The images shown in Supplementary Fig.
7
demonstrate perovskite grains ranging from tens of nanometres to micrometres in size and indicate, at least qualitatively, only small changes of the perovskite bulk morphology across these substrates. Importantly, we find that PFN-P2 causes a substantial reduction of the recombination at the hole transport layer contact, as shown in Fig.
5a,b . This resulted in an average QFLS value (~1.19 eV) very close to the value for the neat perovskite (~1.21 eV) while simultaneously improving the homogeneity of the absolute PL image. To check whether PFN-P2 itself passivates the perovskite surface by reducing trap-assisted recombination independent of the presence of the hole transport layer/perovskite interface, we compared QFLS maps of glass/perovskite and glass/PFN-P2/perovskite samples (Supplementary Table
1 ). No differences in the QFLS were found, which allows us to assign the increased QFLS of the hole transport layer/PFN-P2/perovskite junction to suppressed interfacial recombination. In accordance with this, we recorded a significantly slower TRPL decay on samples including PFN-P2 (Fig.
5c ). Motivated by this success, we aimed to reduce the detrimental recombination at the perovskite/electron transport layer interface. Different strategies have been reported to block holes at the n-interface, such as polystyrene 44
or choline chloride 11
for pin cells or Ga 2 O 3
for nip cells 13 . However, for our triple cation pin perovskite solar cells we found the most significant effect on the QFLS and device efficiency when inserting an ultrathin layer (0.6–1 nm) of LiF between the perovskite and C 60 , causing a reduction of the non-radiative interfacial recombination loss by 35 meV (Fig.
5d,e ). Again, as shown in Fig.
5f , the increase in QFLS was correlated with a slower mono-exponential TRPL decay (with a lifetime that increased from 26 ns to 180 ns for a perovskite/C 60
and perovskite/LiF/C 60
film on glass, respectively.) Fig. 5: Suppression of interfacial recombination through interlayers. a , b , QFLS map (1 × 1 cm) ( a ) and QFLS histogram ( b ) of a PTAA/PFN-P2/perovskite film on glass, demonstrating a comparatively high average QFLS of approximately 1.19 eV. This represents a significant enhancement of approximately 65 meV compared to the QFLS of the PTAA/perovskite film and approaches the QFLS potential of the neat perovskite within 20 mV.

stack (1.169 eV) and the pin device stack (1.173 eV) are both almost identical to the
V OC
of our optimized cells (1.16–1.17 V). The histograms were recorded on a 5 mm × 5 mm square in the middle of the films, without edge effects (PL quenching) due to the encapsulation glue.
c , f , TRPL transients highlighting the significant prolongation of the carrier lifetime when either PFN-P2 ( c ) or LiF ( f ) is added as an interlayer. Full size image Photovoltaic performance Introducing both interlayers led to considerable improvements of the cell efficiency (from an average of 18% to 20%) through an increase in
V OC
and fill factor (see Supplementary Fig.
8
for the performance of 6 mm 2
devices). Importantly, the average
V OC
of cells with both interlayers present is 1.16 V, which compares well with the average QFLS of the perovskite/LiF/C 60
stack and the complete device stack (~1.17 eV, see Supplementary Table
1 ). Measuring the
V OC
as a function of light intensity on cells with and without both interlayers reveals a similar ideality factor but a smaller dark recombination current density for the interlayer-containing device, indicating that these additional layers do affect the rate but not the overall nature of the recombination process (Supplementary Fig.
9 ). From the device manufacturing perspective, introducing PFN-P2 greatly improved the homogeneity of the perovskite films, allowing us to manufacture 1 cm 2
cells without the frequent pinhole formation encountered in our standard cells (without the interlayers), resulting in reproducible high efficiencies. Typically, without PFN-P2, only one out of three 1 cm 2
cells resulted in efficiencies above 18%, while this PCE could be safely achieved with 17 out of 18 cells in two batches with 9 cells each if PFN-P2 was included. Cells with PFN-P2 (but without LiF) reached efficiencies up to 19.6% ( J SC  = 21.85 mA cm –2 ,
V OC  = 1.143 V, fill factor = 78.6% Supplementary Fig.
10 ) when measured with an aperture mask (1.018 cm 2 ) at 25 °C. The short-circuit current matched the integrated external quantum efficiency (EQE) and solar spectrum product (21.5 mA cm –2 ) within an error of less than 2% (Supplementary Fig.
11 ). This cell was certified by an independent accredited institute (Institute for Solar Energy, Fraunhofer Freiburg), which gave a stabilized PCE of 19.22% Supplementary Fig.
12 ) with a negligible mismatch to our
J–V
measurement in terms of current. Moreover, encapsulated cells were stable for at least 100 h under maximum power point (MPP) tracking conditions in air and constant illumination from a white light-emitting diode (LED) with 1 Sun equivalent light intensity, with only a small loss in efficiency (0.6% absolute) (Supplementary Fig.
13 ). We also note that using 10 Ω sq −1
ITO substrates instead of our standard 15 Ω sq −1
ITO substrates allowed us to achieve fill factors above 81%; values which, to our knowledge, are 3% higher than the highest reported fill factors for 1 cm 2
size cells (Supplementary Fig.
14 ) 45 . As expected from the QFLS analysis, the
V OC
of the cells is significantly increased through the introduction of the LiF interlayer (~1.17 V), pushing the PCE of our 1 cm 2
cells up to a value of 20.0%, with virtually no hysteresis and a stable power output, as shown in Fig.
6 . Fig. 6: 20% efficient pin-type perovskite cells with 1 cm 2

perovskite cells reaching 20% PCE were achieved using a combination of PFN-P2 and LiF interlayers ( J SC  = 21.7 mA cm − 2 , fill factor = 78.6%,
V OC  = 1.17 V) as measured with an aperture mask (1.018 cm 2 ) at 25 °C. The inset shows the stabilized power output at 20.1%. Full size image However, compared to the highest certified 1 cm 2
cells 46
with a PCE of 20.9% ( J SC
of 24.9 mA cm –2 , geometry and structure currently unpublished) a remaining limitation of our cells is their relatively low short-circuit current. Thus, to lower the bandgap of the perovskite layer, we optimized the ratio of FAPbI 3
to MAPbBr 3 . We found that using a ratio of 89:11 allows a significant improvement in short-circuit current (0.5–1 mA cm –2 ) with surprisingly minimal loss in
V OC
and efficiencies up to 21.6% for small 6 mm 2
cells ( J SC  = 23.2 mA cm –2 ,
V OC  = 1.156 V, fill factor = 80.4%) (Supplementary Fig.
8 ). As for the 1 cm 2
devices, Supplementary Fig.
15a
shows our present hero device with both interlayers included (PFN-P2 and LiF) fabricated from a CsPbI 0.05 [(FAPbI 3 ) 0.89 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.11 ] 0.95
perovskite with an efficiency of 20.3%, again with very small mismatch versus the integrated EQE–solar spectrum product (Supplementary Fig.
15b ). This cell was certified by Fraunhofer-ISE, resulting in a PCE of 19.83%, which is currently the highest certified efficiency of a 1 cm 2
perovskite cell with published geometry and structure (Supplementary Figs.
16
and
17 ) 4 . We also highlight the important fact that the efficiency of our cells is stabilized, in contrast to most previous perovskite solar cell certifications, which are denoted as ‘not stabilized’ 4 , 46 . Last, we note that our concept to identify and suppress interfacial recombination can be successfully generalized to other perovskite compositions, including the standard methylammonium lead iodide absorber (MAPI), where we reached efficiencies slightly above 20%; as well as Cs-containing formamidinium lead iodide perovskite cells (Cs 0.05 FA 0.95 )PbI 3
with close to 20% PCE (Supplementary Fig.
18 ). The latter system is particularly interesting as pure FAPbI 3
exhibits a bandgap of 1.47 eV, which is closer to the optimum bandgap in the Shockley–Queisser model 47 . However, reports of FAPbI 3
cells are rare and the efficiencies of such devices lag significantly behind the mixed perovskite systems 47 , 48 , 49 . Measurement of the absolute PL from the individual perovskite/charge transport layer junctions proves once again substantial reduction of interfacial recombination by the addition of PFN-P2 and LiF at the p- and n-interfaces, respectively (Supplementary Table
2 ). Notably, this allowed the devices to reach record efficiencies for MA/Br-free FAPbI 3
perovskite solar cells, which further underlines the potential of our recombination analysis and interfacial engineering approach (Supplementary Fig.
18 ). Conclusions Hyperspectral photoluminescence imaging allowed us to identify the origin of non-radiative recombination loss channels through mapping of the QFLS of the relevant perovskite/transport layer combinations. We found significant non-radiative recombination losses in the neat perovskite layer that reduce the potential
V OC
by approximately 135 mV compared to the radiative limit of this type of perovskite (1.345 V). However, interface recombination at each individual hybrid interface (PTAA/perovskite and perovskite/C 60 ) dominates the non-radiative loss current in the stack and results in a significant reduction of the QFLS down to ~1.13 eV. In line with this interpretation, we achieved a considerable improvement of the device performance by applying PFN-P2 and LiF as interfacial layers, which suppressed the recombination losses by 65 meV and 35 meV at the p- and n-interfaces, respectively. The reduced recombination and increased QFLS splitting resulted in significant
V OC
and fill factor gains, which in combination with an optimized composition of the perovskite layer led to a PCE above 20% for 1 cm 2
cells, with a certified PCE of 19.83% and stabilized power output. This work demonstrates how interfacial recombination losses can be unambiguously identified and suppressed, and paves the way to reach the thermodynamic limit for perovskite solar cells through further minimization of interface and trap-assisted recombination in the absorber layer. Methods Hyperspectral absolute photoluminescence imaging Excitation for the PL imaging measurements was performed with two 450 nm LEDs equipped with diffuser lenses. The intensity of the LEDs was adjusted to ~1 Sun by illuminating a contacted perovskite solar cell (short circuit) and matching the current density to the short-circuit current measured in the
J–V
sun simulator (the measured short-circuit current density of the solar cell under this illumination was 22.2 mA cm − 2 ). The photoluminescence image detection was performed with a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (Allied Vision) coupled with a liquid crystal tunable filter. The system was calibrated to absolute photon numbers in two steps in a similar way to the process described by Delamarre and colleagues 50 . For this purpose an infrared laser diode and a spectrally calibrated halogen lamp were coupled to an integrating sphere. The pixel resolution of the images corresponds to about 10 μm in diameter. Sets of images from 650 nm to 1,100 nm taken at a step size of 5 nm were recorded. All absolute PL measurements were performed on films with the same thicknesses as used in the operational solar cells. A global systematic error of 20 meV (or equivalently an approximate factor of two in PL efficiency) was estimated on the basis of uncertainties in the optimum approach to calculate the QFLS (equation ( 2 )), as well as small uncertainties in the estimation of the bandgap and the temperature. Time-resolved PL PL data was acquired with a TCSPC system (Berger & Lahr) after excitation with a pulse-picked and frequency-doubled output from a mode-locked Ti:sapphire oscillator (Coherent Chameleon) with nominal pulse durations ~100 fs and a fluence of ~ 30 nJ cm −2
at a wavelength of 470 nm. The samples were excited from the side of the interface we sought to investigate (that is, the glass side for PTAA and the top side for the other samples). The short-wavelength excitation was chosen to specifically excite the samples close to the interface we were interested in. All TRPL measurements were performed on films with the same thicknesses as used in the operational solar cells. Device fabrication Pre-patterned 2.5 × 2.5 cm² 15 Ω sq −1
ITO substrates (Automatic Research) were cleaned with acetone, 3% Hellmanex solution, deionized water and isopropanol, by sonication for 10 min in each solution. After a microwave plasma treatment (3 min, 200 W), the samples were transferred to a N 2 -filled glovebox. A thin (~8 nm) PTAA (Sigma-Aldrich) layer was spin-coated from a 1.5 mg ml −1
toluene solution at 6,000 r.p.m. for 30 s using an acceleration of 2,000 r.p.m. per second. The layers were subsequently annealed inside a nitrogen-filled glovebox ( < 1 ppm H 2 O and O 2 ) at 100 °C for 10 min. After the substrate was allowed to cool for 5 min, a 60 µl solution of PFN-P2 (0.5 mg ml −1
in methanol) purchased from 1-Material was added to the spinning substrate at 5,000 r.p.m. for 20 s, resulting in a film with thickness below the detection limit of our atomic force microscopy (less than 5 nm). The perovskite layer was prepared using an anti-solvent treatment and the concentration of the perovskite components in the solution and solvent ratios were detailed in a previous work 9 . We found an improvement in
V OC
and reproducibility by switching the anti-solvent from diethyl ether (DEE) to ethyl acetate, which is miscible with dimethylformamide:dimethyl sulfoxide (DMF:DMSO) mixtures and has a higher boiling point (77.1 °C) and an optimal polarity of approximately 4.5. Therefore, all cells reported here were fabricated using ethyl acetate as the anti-solvent. The perovskite layer was deposited by spin-coating at 4,000 r.p.m. for 35 s. Ten seconds after the start of the spinning process, the spinning substrate was washed with 300 µl ethyl acetate for approximately 1 s (the anti-solvent was placed in the centre of the film). The perovskite film was then annealed at 100 °C for 1 h on a preheated hotplate. The samples were transferred to an evaporation chamber and LiF (6 Å to 1 nm), C 60
(30 nm), BCP (8 nm) and copper (100 nm) were deposited under vacuum ( p  = 10 –7  mbar). After completion, the glass side of the 1 cm 2
cells was coated with a Brisbane Materials Technology (Australia Pty Ltd) anti-reflection coating optimized for a broadband spectral response in the AM1.5 window. Current density–voltage characteristics J–V
curves were obtained in a two-wire source-sense configuration with a Keithley 2400. An Oriel class AAA Xenon lamp-based sun simulator was used for illumination, providing approximately 100 mW cm –2
of AM1.5 G irradiation, and the intensity was monitored simultaneously with a Si photodiode. The exact illumination intensity was used for efficiency calculations, and the simulator was calibrated with a KG5-filtered silicon solar cell (certified by Fraunhofer ISE). A spectral mismatch calculation was performed based on the spectral irradiance of the solar simulator, the EQE of the reference silicon solar cell and three typical EQEs of our cells. This resulted in three mismatch factors of
M  = 0.9949, 0.9996 and 0.9976. Given the very small deviation from unity, the measured
J SC
was not corrected by the factor 1/ M . All EQEs presented in this work were measured by ISE-Fraunhofer. Coupled optical and Shockley–Queisser modelling We employed an optical modelling tool 51
to calculate the photogenerated current inside the perovskite material depending on the thickness of the ITO layer. To this end, we kept the other layer thicknesses constant (8 nm PTAA, 450 nm perovskite, 20 nm C 60 , 8 nm BCP, 100 nm copper). We employed measured spectral refractive indices
n
and
k
for all layers under normal incident illumination. The resulting short-circuit current was used to numerically solve the modified Shockley–Queisser equation (typical voltage steps are 1 mV) including an ideality factor of 1.5 (ref.  9 ), a shunt resistance of 4,000 Ω, a luminescent efficiency of 0.1% (ref.  15 ) a radiative current of 8 × 10 –20  A cm –2
and an internal series resistance of 1.5 Ω cm 2
in addition to the series resistance imposed by the ITO for any given thickness and geometry. Our standard ITO (Automatic Research GmbH, Germany) has a nominal sheet resistance of 15 Ω sq −1
with a thickness of 150 nm. We extrapolated the resulting sheet resistance starting from this value. Data availability The data that support the plots within this paper and other findings of this study are available from the corresponding authors upon reasonable request.

Abstract Two-dimensional Ruddlesden–Popper layered metal-halide perovskites have attracted increasing attention for their desirable optoelectronic properties and improved stability compared to their three-dimensional counterparts. However, such perovskites typically consist of multiple quantum wells with a random well width distribution. Here, we report phase-pure quantum wells with a single well width by introducing molten salt spacer
n -butylamine acetate, instead of the traditional halide spacer
n -butylamine iodide. Due to the strong ionic coordination between
n -butylamine acetate and the perovskite framework, a gel of a uniformly distributed intermediate phase can be formed. This allows phase-pure quantum well films with microscale vertically aligned grains to crystallize from their respective intermediate phases. The resultant solar cells achieve a power conversion efficiency of 16.25% and a high open voltage of 1.31 V. After keeping them in 65 ± 10% humidity for 4,680 h, under operation at 85 °C for 558 h, or continuous light illumination for 1,100 h, the cells show <10% efficiency degradation.

Main Two-dimensional Ruddlesden–Popper layered metal-halide perovskites, with desirable optoelectronic properties and good environmental stability, have recently attracted extensive research interest as one of the most promising materials for the fabrication of long-term operationally stable and high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs) 1 , 2 , 3 . The general chemical formula of the layered perovskite is L 2 A n −1 M n X 3 n +1 , where L is a long-chain organic cation (spacer), A is a short-chain organic cation, M is a divalent metal cation and X is a halide anion. The unique architecture, with
n
layers of inorganic [MX 6 ] octahedral sheets sandwiched by two long organic spacer layers, represents a natural quantum well (QW) due to a mismatch in the dielectric constants between the organic and inorganic layers 4 , 5 . However, layered perovskites deposited using solution methods typically suffer from a mixture of multiple quantum wells with a random well width ( n
number) distribution (MQWs), which has severely hindered further progress in this field 6 , 7 , 8 . The component interaction in the solution generally controls the final assembly of the layered perovskite segment. The perovskite solution prepared with stoichiometric amounts of precursors, however, has been confirmed to be a complex mixture of colloid particles with a random size distribution in a mother solution of dissolved ions 9 , 10 . Although the large particles can be easily filtered out, the small particles with a few unit cells persist in the solution, and could act as nucleation centres in forming QWs with different well widths. Therefore, the deposition of phase-pure QWs remains a key scientific challenge for the thermodynamic stability of compounds in solution. Here, we report phase-pure QW thin films by introducing a molten salt spacer
n -butylamine acetate (BAAc), instead of the traditional halide spacers
n -butylamine iodide (BAI). For strong ionic coordination between BAAc and the perovskite framework during the initial stage of solution processing, compounds with a uniformly distributed intermediate phase can be gelled from the precursor solution with near-monodisperse unit cell particles. We observe that the phase-pure QW films with microscale, vertically aligned grains can then be crystallized from their respective intermediate phases. The high phase purity, confirmed by various spectroscopic techniques and crystal structure characterizations, could potentially facilitate charge transport and stabilize the perovskite framework. The photovoltaic devices exhibited a best-performing power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.25% and open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 1.31 V, with greatly improved stability with respect to their MQW counterparts under conditions of humidity, heat and light stress. After keeping them in 65 ± 10% humidity conditions for 4,680 h, under operation at 85 °C for 558 h, or under continuous light illumination for 1,100 h, the unencapsulated devices showed no significant degradation (<10%). Properties of MQW and phase-pure QW films Phase-pure QW (BA 2 MA n −1 Pb n I 3 n +1 ) films, with different well widths (< n > = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; < n > represents the designed
n
value), were prepared by introducing a molten salt spacer BAAc, instead of the traditional halide spacers such as BAI (Supplementary Fig.
1 ) 11 , 12 , 13 . Here,
n
is the number of semiconducting [PbX 6 ] 4−
octahedron slabs within the organic ammonium
n -butylamine (BA) spacers. The number of these slabs determines the QW thickness and the degree of quantum confinement, leading to tunable exciton properties and band gaps. To probe the phase purity of the perovskite films deposited with BAAc, as well as the control films deposited with BAI, femtosecond transient absorption (TA) measurements were conducted on these films (Fig.
1a,b
and Supplementary Figs.
2
and
3 ). Upon a 3.1 eV photon pulse excitation, hot charge carriers are injected into all the perovskite QWs. These hot charge carriers subsequently cool to the band edge states or transfer to the adjacent QWs through quantum coupling. The cooled charge carriers in the band edge states induce pronounced photobleaching (PB) in the transitions associated with these states. The high energy level transitions, which dominate the linear absorption above the band gap, are almost invisible in this differential absorption spectrum. Therefore, even if the volume doping concentration of a QW (with
n ) in a film is very small, the band edge exciton transition associated with this QW (with
n ) can be identified in the white light probe spectrum, at the early probe delay times 3 , 14 , 15 . Although all the films were prepared with the desired precursor stoichiometry for single-phase perovskite QWs, Fig.
1a
clearly shows that the TA spectra of the QWs (< n > = 2, 3, 4, 5) deposited with traditional BAI are dominated by multiple PB peaks. The peaks located at 516, 572, 610, 644, 670 and 760 nm closely match with the band edge exciton transitions in
n  = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and ∞ QWs, respectively. The multiple peaks indicate that the QW films deposited with traditional halide spacers are perovskite MQWs, which is consistent with previous publications 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 14 . The deposition of phase-pure metal-halide perovskite QWs was a long-term challenge for the research community. By contrast, as shown in Fig.
1b , the TA spectra are dominated by single PB peaks, for all the QW films prepared with the molten salt spacer BAAc. The PB signals associated with the undesired phases in each film are almost negligible. These results reveal that near-single-phase perovskite QWs films could be deposited with a molten salt spacer.

1c,d ) and photoluminescence (PL; Fig.
1e,f
and Supplementary Figs.
4
and
5 ) patterns from that of the perovskite MQWs. As presented in Fig.
1c , the MQW films (for < n > ≥ 2) show typical multiple exciton absorption peaks 4 , 5 , 16 , 17 . Correspondingly, the PL spectra of these films are complicated with multiple peaks (Fig.
1e ). Owing to the volume doping concentration of the three-dimensional (3D) perovskite, the phase increases with increasing < n >. This increase combined with an efficient charge carrier funnelling from the thin to thicker QWs 3 , 6 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21
causes the PL of the MQW films with < n > > 2 to be dominated by the broad emission from 3D perovskite, with a slight contribution from thin QWs. By contrast, the linear absorption and PL spectra of phase-pure QW films exhibit a clear single peak (Fig.
1d,f ). Both the absorption and PL peak wavelengths increase monotonically with increasing designed well width < n >. The peak positions of film < n > matched well with the values determined for QW
n 1 , 3 , 18 , 19 . Furthermore, no obvious PL from 3D perovskite was observed for any of the films. These results further confirm that near-single-phase perovskite QW films were deposited with the molten salt spacer BAAc. In light of the above findings, as well as the results of a comparative optical investigation by probing from the top (QW side) and bottom (quartz side) surfaces, the schematic structures of the films deposited with BAI and BAAc are illustrated in Fig.
1g,h , respectively. MQWs with a graded vertical distribution are formed in the films deposited with BAI. Thin QWs were located near the substrate and thick QWs (including the 3D phase) were located on the top, which is consistent with previous reports 17 , 19 . The 3D ( n  = ∞) phase on top of the films is subject to degradation, which is not good for perovskite stability. By contrast, the phase-pure QW films deposited with BAAc possess a continuous phase distribution, which not only ensures stability but also guarantees efficient carrier transport along the vertical direction 22 . The vertical alignment of the phase-pure QWs was proved with the following crystal structure characterizations. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the QW films deposited with BAI and BAAc are shown in Fig.
2a,b , respectively. In MQW films deposited with BAI, clear periodic two-dimensional (2D) crystallographic planes (00 k ) and (0 k 0) were observed for the < n > = 1 and < n > = 2 films, respectively. However, the 2D crystallographic planes disappeared in the films with < n > ≥ 3 for the largely mixed phases, which is consistent with previous reports 8 , 12 , 23 . By contrast, clear periodic 2D crystallographic planes (0 k 0) were observed in all the films (< n > = 2, 3, 4, 5) deposited with BAAc, which further confirmed their high phase purity. To further elucidate the crystal orientation of the QWs on the substrate, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were performed on the films (< n > = 4) deposited with BAI and BAAc (Fig.
2c,d ). The MQW film exhibited diffraction rings with the signal of the (111) plane, indicating considerable randomness of the polycrystalline orientation, which agrees well with the X-ray diffraction results. However, sharp, sporadic Bragg spots in the phase-pure QW films were observed, such as (060), (080) and (0100) diffractions, suggesting superior crystallinity and preferential orientation with respect to the substrate and high phase purity. The aligned phase-pure QWs could build an efficient carrier-transport channel between the two electrodes, which is favourable for electronic devices 17 , 24 . The surface morphologies of the films were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (Fig.
2e,f
and Supplementary Figs.
6
and
7 ). The results show that phase-pure QW films possess a smooth surface with a large average grain size of ~10 μm, while the MQW films possess much smaller grains (~1–2 µm) and obvious pinholes. The high quality of the phase-pure QW films was further confirmed by atomic force microscopy and photo-image measurements (Supplementary Figs.
8
and
9 ). These dense and pinhole-free perovskite films with smooth surfaces and excellent crystallinity are highly desirable for optoelectronic devices.

Source data Full size image Probing the formation mechanisms of phase-pure QWs The introduction of BAAc into the precursor solution instead of the traditional BAI affected the perovskite sol–gel processes during spin coating. These processes may include solution formation, gelation and crystallization 9 , 25 , 26 . The solution, prepared with stoichiometric amounts of precursors, has been confirmed to be a complex mixture of colloid particles with random size distribution in a mother solution of dissolved ions 9 , 10 . Although large particles are easily filtered out before spin coating, the small particles with one to a few unit cells persist in the solution, and can act as nucleation centres forming QWs with different well widths. Therefore, this random particle size distribution in the precursor solution is a fundamental limitation for depositing phase-pure QWs films. Here, particle size distribution in the precursor solutions prepared with BAI and BAAc was examined by dynamic light scattering (Fig.
3a ). In the solution prepared with BAI, the particles were randomly distributed, with separation varying from 1 nm to several micrometres, indicating different degrees of [PbI 6 ] 4−
octahedron aggregation 9 , 10 , 25 , 27 . Surprisingly, in the solution prepared with BAAc, the particles showed a very narrow size distribution (~0.6 nm). This narrow size distribution may originate from the strong interaction between Ac −
and Pb 2+ , which prevents the aggregation of colloids with more than one unit cell. Fig. 3: Probing the formation mechanisms of phase-pure QWs. a , Dynamic light scattering shows the particle size distributions in the precursor solutions prepared with BAI and BAAc.

f , The
1 H NMR spectra show there is a strong upfield chemical shift in the resonance signal of –NH 3 +
protons by introducing BAAc instead of BAI into the perovskite precursor solution with DMSO-d 6
at 295 K (the orange arrow represents the shift of –NH 3 +
protons). Source data Full size image To prove this strong interaction between the carbonyl groups of acetate and Pb 2+ , attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared spectra were collected (Fig.
3b ). The asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration peaks of Ac −
in pure BAAc are located at 1,557 cm −1
and 1,402 cm −1 , respectively. The corresponding peaks shifted to 1,548 cm −1
and 1,405 cm −1
upon interaction with the lead ions 28 . This strong coordination interaction may result in the formation of a stable and homogeneous precursor solution. In addition, the local coordination environment of Pb ions in the precursor solution was examined by X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy at the Pb L3 edge (Fig.
3c–e ). The extended X-ray absorption fine structure study showed that the coordination environment of Pb in BAAc precursor solution is distinctly different from that in the BAI precursor solution (Supplementary Table
1 ). In the solution with BAI, a dominant peak at a distance
R  = 2.8 ± 0.01 Å was observed in the Fourier-transformed spectrum (Fig.
3d ), which corresponds to the Pb–I scattering path. However, in the solution with BAAc (Fig.
3e ), the peak of the Fourier-transformed spectrum is located at
R  = 1.8 ± 0.01 Å, which corresponds to the Pb–O scattering path. Therefore, the strong coordination interaction between Ac −
and Pb 2+
was further confirmed by the results of the X-ray absorption near-edge structure. Furthermore, the
1 H NMR spectra (Fig.
3f ) show that there is a strong upfield chemical shift (Δ δ  ≈ 0.08 ppm) in the resonance signal of the –NH 3 +
protons, by introducing BAAc (7.57 ppm) instead of BAI (7.49 ppm) into the perovskite precursor solution. This chemical shift is caused by the stronger shielding effect of N–H•••O=C–O −
compared to the N–H•••I −
hydrogen bond. For these strong coordination interactions between Ac −
and the precursors as well as the high viscosity and negligible vapour pressure of BAAc (ref.
25 ), as the other solvents evaporate during the initial stage of spin coating, a uniformly distributed intermediate phase could be gelled from the precursor solution with near-monodisperse unit cell particles. Subsequently, a phase-pure QW film with microscale vertically aligned grains could be crystallized from the intermediate phase, by ejecting the coordinated molten salt and evaporating the by-product methylammonium acetate (MAAc). To more clearly illustrate the mechanisms of different QW films deposited with BAI and BAAc, the reaction formation enthalpies were also calculated using density functional theory from first principles. The results clearly show that MQW formation has the lowest enthalpy value in the case of BAI. However, the formation of phase-pure QWs is thermodynamically preferred by introducing BAAc (Supplementary Note

and
11 ). Photovoltaic performance of solar cells To demonstrate the potential application of phase-pure QW films, efficient solar cells with remarkably high stability and high
V OC
were constructed. The device structure is made up of layers of indium tin oxide (ITO), SnO 2
(~50 nm), perovskite QWs (~500 nm), spiro-OMeTAD (2,2’,7,7’-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9’-spirobifluorene) (~200 nm), MoO 3
(~5 nm) and Au (~80 nm; Supplementary Fig.
12 ). Here, a value of < n > = 4 QWs is used for its balanced wide-band visible-light absorption and good stability (for other < n > QW devices, see Supplementary Fig.
13
and Supplementary Table
2 ). Scanning transmission electron microscopy cross-sectional images of a typical phase-pure QW device are shown in Fig.
4a . Compact multiple layers with clear contrast can be observed. The coloured energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy elemental mapping exhibits a uniform distribution of lead and iodide across the perovskite layer, which is further confirmed by the intensity of lead and iodide elemental signals. The uniform element distribution in the phase-pure QW film is significantly different from the vertical gradient distribution of the elements in the MQW films 19 . A PCE of 16.25% was achieved for the phase-pure QW PSC, with a record high
V OC
of 1.31 V, a short-circuit current density ( J SC ) of 16.75 mA cm −2 , a fill factor of 74.07% and negligible
J – V
hysteresis (Fig.
4b
and Supplementary Table
3 ). By comparison, the MQW PSC demonstrated a PCE of 13.81%, with a
V OC
of 1.12 V, a
J SC
of 18.43 mA cm −2 , a fill factor of 66.95% and visible
J – V
hysteresis. The increased
J SC
in the MQW PSC was caused by the broadened visible-light absorption in the MQW film. However, with the large increases in
V OC
and fill factor, the phase-pure QW PSC presented a substantially higher PCE than the MQW PSC. The steady-state output powers, measured under the maximum power point voltages, are 16.14% and 12.97% for the champion phase-pure QW and MQW devices, respectively (Fig.
4c ). The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra and integrated
J SC
of the two champion devices are presented in Fig.
4d . The IPCE spectra closely match the corresponding linear absorption spectra (Fig.
1c,d ). The integrated
J SC
is also in good agreement with the value derived from the corresponding
J – V
measurements. The statistical results of the devices’ performance are shown in Supplementary Fig.
14 . For each condition, 20 devices were fabricated. Fig. 4: Photovoltaic characteristics and stability of layered PSCs based on MQWs and phase-pure QWs. a , A cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy image (scale bars, 500 nm) showing the device architecture: ITO/SnO 2

g , Illumination stability performance of the unencapsulated solar cells under continuous one sun, AM1.5G illumination. (The blue and pink curves represent the MQWs and phase-pure QWs devices, respectively). Source data Full size image To explore whether the QW phase purity will affect stability, the long-term stability of the PSCs was recorded under various conditions without encapsulation. After storage under ambient conditions (65 ± 10% relative humidity) for 4,680 h, the phase-pure QW device retained 93.8% of its original PCE, while the MQW device showed a 49.4% PCE loss (Fig.
4e ). Under accelerated ageing tests in a N 2 -filled glovebox (Fig.
4f,g ), the phase-pure QW cells retained 95.7% of their original PCE after continuous heating at 85 °C for 558 h, and retained 96.2% of the initial PCE after continuous illumination at AM1.5G for 1,100 h. By contrast, the MQW device retained only 59.1% and 70.8% of its initial PCE after the corresponding ageing tests (Supplementary Table
4 ). Therefore, the phase-pure QW device possesses much better stability than the MQW device under varying conditions. This conclusion is also consistent with a previous publication 12 , which concluded that the stability of thin QWs is better than that of thick QWs (or 3D perovskite). The long organic cation spacers between the inorganic slabs could be responsible for blocking the perovskite from reacting with moisture and oxygen, as well as inhibiting ion migration within the perovskite lattice 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 . In phase-pure QW films, the inorganic slabs are uniformly protected by the spacer layers, whereas in the MQW films, there are substantial thick QWs and 3D perovskite crystals. Hence, QW phase purity is of crucial importance for device stability. Conclusions Our findings show that the traditional constraints of deposition phase-pure QW films could be overcome by introducing a molten salt spacer. High-quality phase-pure QW films in 2D Ruddlesden–Popper layered perovskite with microscale vertically aligned grains were produced, yielding an efficient and stable PSC. Compared to the traditional all-inorganic QWs deposited with vacuum methods 33 , the hybrid organic–inorganic metal-halide perovskite phase-pure QWs offer several improvements, including solution processability, low-temperature fabrication and atomic layer accuracy. Considering the good stability, unique structure and optoelectronic properties, we anticipate that the phase-pure QWs will facilitate the development of solar cells and other perovskite-based optoelectronic devices, such as detectors, light-emitting diodes and lasers. Methods Materials Methylammonium iodide (MAI, 99.9%), butylammonium iodide (BAI, 99.9%) and poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine) (PTAA, 99.9%) were purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology. Lead iodide (PbI 2 , 99.99%) and 4-isopropyl-4′-methyldiphenyliodonium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate (TPFB, 98.0%) were purchased from TCI Development. Spiro-OMeTAD (Lumtec, 99.5%), acetonitrile (ACN, 99.8% anhydrous), 4- tert -butylphenol ( t -BP, 99%), bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (Li-TFSI, 99.95% trace metals basis),
N , N -dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.99%), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, 99.5%), chlorobenzene (99.9%), BA (98%), hydriodic acid (HI, 57 wt% in H 2 O), acetic acid (HAc, 99.99%), ethyl alcohol, acetone and isopropyl alcohol were used as received from Sigma-Aldrich. The SnO 2
colloid precursor was obtained from Alfa Aesar (tin( iv ) oxide, 15% in H 2 O colloidal dispersion), and the particles were diluted by H 2 O to 2.67% before use. Unless otherwise noted, all the reagents were used without additional treatment. Synthesis of BAAc First, 50 ml acetic acid and 71 ml butylamine were injected and stirred in a 250 ml round-bottom flask in an ice water bath for 2 h. After stirring at 0 °C for 2 h, the resulting solution was recovered by reduced pressure rotary evaporation at 80 °C for 1 h and produced synthesized liquid chemical BAAc. The liquid product was put into a refrigerator for 2 h to crystallize. The frozen product was washed three times with diethyl ether and then was dissolved in ethanol and recrystallized from diethyl ether three times. Then, the solid product was dissolved in ethanol again, and liquid product was collected by reduced pressure rotary evaporation at 80 °C for 1 h. Finally, the liquid product was cooled to room temperature. Synthesis of perovskite precursors The BA 2 MA n -1 Pb n I 3 n +1
perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving BAI, MAI and PbI 2 , or BAAc, MAI and PbI 2
in DMF and DMSO (volume ratio is 4:1). For the
n  = 1–5 systems, the molar concentration of BAAc (liquid) was 0.58 mmol ml –1 , 0.31 mmol ml –1 , 0.21 mmol ml –1 , 0.16 mmol ml –1
and 0.13 mmol ml –1 , respectively. The obtained solution was stirred at 65 °C for 2 h in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. BAAc-based precursor (< n > = 1) was prepared with BAAc (76.86 mg, 0.58 mmol), HI (~66 µl, 0.58 mmol) and PbI 2
(133.14 mg, 0.29 mmol) in DMF and DMSO. For the < n > > 1 precursor, we provided additional MAI with the BAAc in the amount needed to make up for the insufficient iodine; for example, the < n > = 2 precursor contained BAAc (41.47 mg, 0.31 mmol), MAI (74.36 mg, 0.47 mmol) and PbI 2
(143.74 mg, 0.31 mmol); < n > = 3 precursor contained BAAc (28.39 mg, 0.21 mmol), MAI (67.90 mg, 0.43 mmol) and PbI 2
(147.65 mg, 0.32 mmol); < n > = 4 precursor contained BAAc (21.59 mg, 0.16 mmol), MAI (64.53 mg, 0.41 mmol) and PbI 2
(149.68 mg, 0.32 mmol); and < n > = 5 precursor contained BAAc (17.42 mg, 0.13 mmol), MAI (62.46 mg, 0.39 mmol) and PbI 2
(150.93 mg, 0.33 mmol). Device fabrication The patterned ITO substrate was washed with deionized water, acetone, ethanol and isopropanol successively, with drying under nitrogen flow. After 15 min ultraviolet–O 3
treatments, a SnO 2
nanocrystal solution was spin coated on the substrate at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s to form a 50-nm-thick electron-transporting layer, which was then annealed at 150 °C for 30 min in air. For the persistent hot-casting process, the ITO/SnO 2
substrates were preheated at 100 °C on the spin coater for 5 min, and 50 μl of precursor solution was dropped onto the hot substrate. The spin coater was immediately started with a spin speed of 4,000 r.p.m. for 20 s with 4,000 ramp, and the substrate temperature was elevated from 100 °C to 110 °C by a program controller. The colour of the thin film turned from pale yellow to brown in a few seconds as the solvent escaped. After spin coating, the substrates were quickly removed from the spin coater and annealed at 100 °C for 5 min covered with a small Petri dish. The substrates were then transferred to a nitrogen glove box to complete the device fabrication. For the hole transporting layer, a spiro-OMeTAD/chlorobenzene (75 mg ml –1 ) solution was employed with the addition of 35 μl Li-TFSI/acetonitrile (260 mg ml –1 ) and 30 μl 4-tertbutylpyridine. For the stability test, PTAA solution was obtained by dissolving 40 mg PTAA powder in 1 ml chlorobenzene with 10% TPFB. Then 35 μl of the spiro-OMeTAD solution or PTAA solution was dropped onto the perovskite-coated substrate and spin coated at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. The device was finished by the thermal evaporation of molybdenum trioxide (5 nm) and Au (80 nm) under vacuum with a shadow mask that kept an active area of 0.05 cm 2 . Characterization The crystallographic structure information was characterized on a Rigaku (Smart Lab 3 kW) X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation,
λ  = 1.5406 Å) at a speed of 20 degrees per minute under the operation conditions of 40 kV and 30 mA. Scanning electron microscopy images were obtained via a field emission scanning electron microscope (JEOL-JSM7800F). UV–visible–near-infrared absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV 1750 spectrophotometer at room temperature. PL (excitation at 400 nm) was measured with an Edinburgh Instruments machine (FLSP980). The
J – V
curves were recorded with a Keithley 2400 source meter and 425 W collimated xenon lamp (Enlitech SS-F5-3A) calibrated with the light intensity to 100 mW cm −2
under AM1.5G solar light conditions by a certified silicon solar cell (NREL). To ensure the accuracy of the
J SC
measured from the
J – V
scans, a mask with an aperture area of 0.05 cm 2
was covered during the measurement. The
J – V
curves were scanned by reverse (forward bias (1.4 V) → short circuit (−0.2 V)) or forward (short circuit (−0.2 V) → forward bias (1.4 V)) scan with a scan rate of 50 mV s −1
and 1 ms delay time. The
J – V
measurements of non-encapsulated solar cells were performed in a N 2 -filled glove box. The IPCE was measured on a QE-3011 computer-controlled system (Enlitech). The diameter of the fibre-optical for the IPCE measurements was 3 mm. Dynamic light scattering measurements were performed by a Zetasizer Nano 55 ZS instrument (Malvern Instruments) with a 633 nm He–Ne laser. Stability test The thermal stability of the non-encapsulated solar cell was tested in a nitrogen atmosphere by tracking the device performance at 85 °C. Light stress stability tests were carried out under AM1.5G solar light in a N 2 -filled glove box. Full simulated sunlight was used during the whole ageing process. All devices were aged under open-circuit conditions, and were taken out from the chamber and tested at different time intervals under a separate solar simulator (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm −2 ) for
J – V
characterization. The
J – V
curves were recorded with a Keithley 2400 source meter under one sun illumination (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm −2 ), equipped with a 425 W collimated xenon lamp (Enlitech SS-F5-3A), in which the light intensity was calibrated by the NREL certified silicon solar cell. When measuring the cells during ageing, we removed them from the ageing chamber and allowed them to cool to room temperature, which typically took a few minutes. The relative humidity in the laboratory was within 65 ± 10% during the entire ageing test. GIWAXS measurements GIWAXS measurements were performed at beamline BL14B1 of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Samples prepared on Si/SnO 2
substrates used an X-ray beam ( λ  = 0.68877 Å) at an incident angle of 0.20° for 20 s, and the scattered light was collected by a MarCCD charge-coupled device detector system at a distance of ~746 mm vertically from the sample. Fourier-transform infrared spectra Fourier-transform infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 6700 Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer equipped with a mercury–cadmium–telluride detector. KBr was put in the sample position for background collection. Infrared spectra were recorded at the same temperature in the 4,000–500 cm −1
range; 32 scans were recorded in the absorbance mode. A Nicolet 6700 instrument equipped with a mercury–cadmium–telluride detector was used to collect transmission infrared spectra of powder samples at a 4 cm −1
resolution.
1 H NMR The
1 H NMR spectra were recorded on a JNM-ECZR (JEOL) NMR spectrometer. The samples were prepared by dissolving 15 μl BAAc and BAI precursors in 0.8 ml DMSO-d 6 . Atomic force microscopy measurements The surface morphologies of the perovskite films with < n > = 4 values were measured using ScanAsyst in air. The cantilever used is ScanAsyst-Air, a silicon tip on a nitride lever with spring constant of ~0.4 N m –1 . Samples were prepared in air under the same spin-coating conditions as the devices. Scanning transmission electron microscope measurements We used a dual-beam focused-ion-beam system (Quata 3D FEG) to prepare the cross-sectional samples. The samples were characterized by a Titan G2 80–200 ChemiSTEM microscope operated at 200 kV. High-angle annular dark-field and transmission electron microscopy observations on the samples were conducted using a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 microscope operated at 200 kV. All transmission electron microscopy experiments were conducted under low-dose conditions to minimize beam damage. X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy measurements Transmission mode Pb L-III edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy measurements were collected on the 1W1B beamline of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Institute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy of Science. The electron beam energy of the storage ring was 3.5 GeV with a maximum stored current of 300 mA. All the collected spectra were processed and analysed using Athena and Artemis software (version 0.9.26) within the IFEFFIT package 34 . Pb metal foil was calibrated to the literature photoelectron energy origin value,
E 0 , for the Pb L-III edge (13,035 eV). The background was removed, and the data were assigned an Rbkg value of 1.4. The passive electron factors,
S 0 2 , were determined by fitting the result of the experimental PbO and PbI 2
data, and then fixed for further analysis of the measured samples. The parameters including the electronic properties (for example, correction to
E 0 ) and nature structure coordination environment including coordination number (CN), fitting bond distance ( R ) and Debye–Waller factor ( σ 2 ) around the absorbing atoms were allowed to vary in the whole fitting process. The fitted ranges for
R
and
k
spaces ( k
weighted), where
k
is the wave vector of the ejected photoelectron, were selected to be
R  = 1.4−3.5 Å −1
and
k  = 2.6−13.0 Å −1 , respectively. Transient absorption The broadband femtosecond TA spectra of the perovskite films were taken using the Ultrafast System HELIOS TA spectrometer. The laser source was a Coherent Legend regenerative amplifier (150 fs, 1 kHz, 800 nm) seeded by a Coherent Vitesse oscillator (100 fs, 80 MHz). The broadband probe pulses (420–780 nm) were generated by focusing a small portion (around 10 mJ) of the fundamental 800 nm laser pulses into a 2 mm sapphire plate. The 400 nm laser pulses were generated by passing the strong 800 nm femtosecond laser beam through a beta barium borate crystal. Theoretical calculation The generalized gradient approximation proposed by Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof was used for the electronic exchange and correlation function. The energy cut-off was 500 eV, and a Monkhorst–Pack
k -mesh of 2 × 2 × 1 was used in the calculations. All atoms were allowed to relax during the geometrical optimization until the force acting on a single atom was less than 0.01 eV Å –1 . The initial atomic structures of MAI, PbI 2 , BAAc, MAAc and BAI are built according to the literature 4 , 6 , 23 , 25 , 26 , 35
(Supplementary Fig.
10 ). The optimized simulated structures of BA 2 MAPb 2 I 7 , BA 2 MA 2 Pb 3 I 10 , BA 2 MA 3 Pb 4 I 13
and MAPbI 3
are shown in Supplementary Fig.

Abstract Solar cells based on organic–inorganic halide perovskites have recently shown rapidly rising power conversion efficiencies, but exhibit unusual behaviour such as current–voltage hysteresis and a low-frequency giant dielectric response. Ionic transport has been suggested to be an important factor contributing to these effects; however, the chemical origin of this transport and the mobile species are unclear. Here, the activation energies for ionic migration in methylammonium lead iodide (CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 ) are derived from first principles, and are compared with kinetic data extracted from the current–voltage response of a perovskite-based solar cell. We identify the microscopic transport mechanisms, and find facile vacancy-assisted migration of iodide ions with an activation energy of 0.6 eV, in good agreement with the kinetic measurements. The results of this combined computational and experimental study suggest that hybrid halide perovskites are mixed ionic–electronic conductors, a finding that has major implications for solar cell device architectures.

Introduction Solar cell materials based on organo-lead halide perovskites are attracting extraordinary attention on account of the rapid rise in their solar-to-electricity conversion efficiencies 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . Other key features of these hybrid perovskites include their ease of solution-based processing at low temperature, and their strong optical absorption, although there are significant stability issues. Devices based on methylammonium lead iodide, CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 , have dominated most research 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 , as so far they exhibit the highest power conversion efficiencies (>20%); these values are comparable to those of the best thin-film solar cells based on Cu(In,Ga)Se 2
or CdTe, but greater than those of conventional dye-sensitized or organic solar cells. The ABX 3
perovskite-type structure, illustrated in
Fig. 1 , is comprised of an extended framework of corner-sharing PbI 6
octahedra with the methylammonium cation (CH 3 NH 3 + ) occupying the central
A
site and surrounded by 12 nearest-neighbour iodide ions. Figure 1: Perovskite structure of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 . Methylammonium cation (CH 3 NH 3 + ) occupies the central

site surrounded by 12 nearest-neighbour iodide ions in corner-sharing PbI 6
octahedra. Full size image Inorganic perovskite oxides have been intensively researched for decades in connection with a rich variety of solid-state magnetic, ferroelectric and conduction properties. In particular, it is well known that numerous perovskite oxides (for example, Sr- and Mg-doped LaGaO 3 ) exhibit high ionic conductivity mediated by defect species (typically oxide-ion vacancies), making them useful in applications such as solid oxide fuel cells 33 , 34 . In addition, ionic conductivity studies of inorganic perovskite halides (for example, CuPbI 3
and CsPbCl 3 ) have reported low activation energies for the migration of halide-ion vacancies 35 , 36 , 37 . Diffusion of intrinsic ionic defects in organo-lead halide perovskites has important implications in terms of the long-term stability and performance of perovskite solar cell devices. In these hybrid perovskites, however, the exact nature of the mobile ionic species and migration activation energies are poorly understood. Charge transport and resistivity studies of hybrid halide perovskites have largely focussed on their semiconducting (electron/hole transport) behaviour, and indicate high carrier mobility and long minority-carrier diffusion lengths 10 , 11 , 12 . Current–voltage characteristics show a hysteresis in photovoltaic performance 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 ; this has been speculated to be related to ion migration 17 , 18 . Xing
et al. 22
suggest that the non-radiative pathways involved in electron–hole recombination may include bulk defects such as vacancies. From spectroscopic impedance studies, Dualeh
et al. 31
suggest that the hybrid perovskites might exhibit ionic charge transport in addition to electronic conduction. More recently, Xiao
et al. 32
ascribe the field-switchable photovoltaic effect to the drift of charged ions or vacancies, although they provided no direct evidence for ion diffusion. In addition to ion migration, ferroelectric and charge-trapping effects have also been suggested as possible mechanisms 13 . Recent analysis of quasielastic neutron scattering data 23 , as well as polarization and piezoresponse force microscopy measurements 38
suggests that ferroelectric behaviour in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
is unlikely to be the dominant mechanism behind the observed hysteresis. Simple capture and release of photogenerated charges in bulk or interfacial defects is also unlikely due to the magnitude and duration of the changes in photocurrent during relaxation following biasing. Previous electronic structure calculations have been used to examine band structures, spin–orbit coupling and intrinsic defects in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
(refs

51 ). The defect studies 45 , 46
suggest that Pb 2+ , I −
and CH 3 NH 3 +
(MA + ) vacancies create shallow donor or acceptor levels. Recent simulation work 41
shows the prevalence of ionic over electronic disorder in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
with low formation energies for Schottky-type defects associated with anion and cation vacancies, shown in the following reaction in the Kröger–Vink notation for the full Schottky defect, where nil represents the perfect CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3

V
indicates a vacancy, subscripts the ionic species and superscripts the effective defect charge (a dot for each positive charge and prime for each negative charge); recent results 41
suggest a significant equilibrium concentration of I − , Pb 2+
and CH 3 NH 3 +
vacancies at room temperature, which could support vacancy-mediated diffusion. Macroscopic conductivity or diffusion experiments, however, have so far not enabled the mobile defect species or the atomistic transport mechanism to be identified. Here, we investigate key issues related to intrinsic defect migration in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
using first-principles techniques combined with kinetic experiments monitoring the photocurrent relaxation of devices, extending our previous work on hybrid perovskites 39 , 40 , 41
and ion transport in perovskite-type oxides 33 , 52 . We have carried out a detailed examination of the pathways and relative activation energies for the vacancy-mediated migration of I − , Pb 2+
and CH 3 NH 3 +
ions, and compared these values directly with kinetic data extracted from a working CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
solar cell. The results support a mechanism of vacancy-mediated ion diffusion, pointing to mixed ionic–electronic conduction in these hybrid perovskites. The implications for perovskite solar cell operation and stability are discussed. Results Migration mechanisms and energies It is well established that the mobile ionic species in the solid state is associated with some type of vacancy or interstitial defect, the concentration of which is controlled by intrinsic Schottky and Frenkel defect reactions, non-stoichiometry or aliovalent doping 33 , 34 , 53 . In materials with the ABX 3
perovskite structure, vacancy-mediated diffusion is the most common process, which is further supported for CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
by the ease of formation of Schottky disorder (reaction (1)), with an intrinsic concentration of I − , Pb 2+
and CH 3 NH 3 +
vacancies predicted to exceed 0.4% at room temperature 41 . Interstitial migration has not been observed in inorganic perovskite oxides or halides due to the lack of interstitial space in such close-packed structures. In this study, three vacancy transport mechanisms involving conventional hopping between neighbouring positions (illustrated in
Fig. 2 ) were considered. These were (i) I −
migration along an octahedron edge; (ii) Pb 2+
migration along the diagonal (<110> directions) of the cubic unit cell; (iii) CH 3 NH 3 +
migration into a neighbouring vacant
A -site cage. Energy profiles for these mechanisms were mapped out by performing a series of transition-state calculations between adjacent equivalent sites. Particular care has to be taken to ensure the starting and end point configurations are well converged to avoid anomalously low migration energies. This approach allows the energy barrier to ion migration to be determined, and has been used successfully in previous studies on oxide-ion, proton and metal-ion migration in perovskite oxides 52 , 54 . One particular challenge is to adequately describe the polarization response to the change in position of the migrating ion, which involves a combination of electronic polarization and lattice relaxation; this required the large supercells employed here to minimize any spurious interactions. Figure 2: Transport mechanisms in the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
perovskite structure. Schematic illustration of the three ionic transport mechanisms involving conventional vacancy hopping between neighbouring positions: ( a ) I −
migration along an octahedron edge; Pb 2+
migration along the diagonal direction <110>; ( b ) CH 3 NH 3 +
migration into a neighbouring vacant
A -site cage involving motion normal to the unit cell face composed of four iodide ions. Full size image The migration activation energies for the three mechanisms are reported in
Table 1 . The lowest activation energy of 0.58 eV suggests favourable vacancy-assisted diffusion of iodide ions. A higher activation energy of 0.84 eV is found for CH 3 NH 3 +
migration, which involves motion through the unit cell face or bottleneck comprising four I −
ions (ion radius of 2.20 Å); this value is probably at the lower limit since we have considered the ideal migration path normal to the unit cell face. In addition, neutron diffraction 55
and quasielastic neutron scattering 23
studies confirm a high level of orientational motion of the CH 3 NH 3 +
ion at room temperature, which is likely to further inhibit long-range transport.
Table 1
shows a high energy barrier for Pb 2+
vacancy migration, suggesting an immobile Pb sublattice. This result is consistent with the thermodynamic stability of the inorganic lead iodide sublattice of the perovskite structure. The high activation energy for Pb 2+
transport also suggests that such cation diffusion is likely to be rate controlling for crystal growth processes. Table 1 Calculated activation energies for ionic migration in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 . Full size table From the calculated activation energies a diffusion coefficient can be estimated. Assuming a Boltzmann-like barrier-hopping process with a typical attempt frequency of 10 12  Hz for ionic species at a temperature of 320 K, we estimate a diffusion coefficient of 10 −12  cm 2  s −1
for I −
ions, which is four orders of magnitude higher than the value of 10 −16  cm 2  s −1
for CH 3 NH 3 + , suggesting negligible diffusion of CH 3 NH 3 +
ions. These results clearly indicate that hybrid halide perovskites are mixed ionic–electronic conductors with iodide ions as the majority ionic carriers. A key factor for ionic conductivity will be the level of intrinsic iodide ion vacancies in the material, which will be sensitive to the synthesis conditions (equilibrium or non-equilibrium) and thermal processing routes. It is recognized that, as in binary lead halides, there are stability and photodecomposition issues with these hybrid lead perovskites 1 , 2 , 56 , which require further investigation. With regard to mechanistic features, it is often assumed that the migrating ion takes the shortest path between adjacent sites, that is, a direct linear jump. However, detailed analysis of the migration paths for the iodide ion vacancy mechanism reveals a small deviation from the linear route involving a curved path between iodine sites, with the saddle point slightly bowed away from the neighbouring Pb ion (shown in
Fig. 3
together with the corresponding energy profile); such an atomic-scale mechanism is difficult to extract from an experiment alone. It is worth noting that analogous curved paths have been found from both atomistic simulation 52
and neutron diffraction studies 33 , 57
of oxide-ion conduction in inorganic perovskite oxides such as doped LaGaO 3 . Similar mechanisms may feature in related hybrid halide perovskites. Figure 3: Iodide ion vacancy migration from density functional theory calculations. ( a ) Calculated migration path indicating a slightly curved path and local relaxation/tilting of the octahedra. ( b ) Corresponding energy profile. Full size image Kinetic measurements Several recent studies have probed current–voltage hysteresis in hybrid perovskite solar cells 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 . However, there is currently an absence of temperature-dependent kinetic data. Hysteresis is frequently observed when performing a photocurrent–voltage scan on the device. If the voltage is held at forward bias and then swept from forward to reverse, the power conversion efficiency inferred from the measurement can be as much as 90% higher than that inferred if the current–voltage scan proceeds from reverse to forward bias. The size of the difference depends on the scan rates, the preconditioning voltage and time and the light level. Recent studies indicate that there is no direct influence of light on the hysteresis in the photocurrent 15 , 17 . Light may have an indirect effect on hysteresis by generating a photovoltage that influences device performance in a similar way to the application of an external bias. The effect of sweeping voltage with time can be decoupled from the hysteresis phenomenon by making stepped chronophotoampereometry measurements where the relaxation of the photocurrent towards a steady-state value at short circuit is observed following application of a constant bias in the dark. By measuring the temperature- and time-dependent photocurrent following forward and reverse biasing in the dark, the rate at which the cell relaxes to equilibrium can be determined and thus activation energies for the relaxation of the device can be estimated (see
Fig. 4a,b ). The temperature range covered in this study is representative of typical device-operating temperatures but below the second-order tetragonal-to-cubic phase transition. Following dark reverse bias conditions, the photocurrent rise at short circuit was fitted well by a bi-exponential. The time constant for the initial part of the photocurrent rise after reverse biasing varied between 53 s at −9.5 °C and 0.36 s at 50 °C. The time constant for the slower phase of the rise was six times longer, with values very similar to those obtained by fitting to single exponential functions to the tail of the photocurrent decay following forward biasing in the dark ( Fig. 4a ). The shape of the photocurrent relaxations remained relatively constant but scaled with time according to the temperature, implying that only the kinetics of the relaxation process had changed. The activation energies for short-circuit photocurrent relaxation from both forward (1 V) and reverse bias (−0.5 V) preconditioning were similar: 0.68 eV and 0.60–0.62 eV, respectively. This similarity, combined with the observation that the slow phases of both the rise and fall of the photocurrent have approximately the same time constants for a given temperature, suggests that the underlying process controlling the relaxation is reversible.

( a ) The measurement sequence in a d-TiO 2 /CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 /spiro-OMeTAD/Au cell is indicated; measured temperatures (to the nearest 0.5 °C) of the devices were −9.5 (dark blue), −5.5, 0.5, 5, 10.5, 15, 19.5, 24.5, 30, 40 and 50 °C (dark red). The dark current under forward bias was very sensitive to fluctuations in the controlled temperature; no time constants were taken from the dark current. ( b ) Arrhenius plot of the rates of photocurrent relaxation. Fits (purple lines) to the fast ( k 1 ) and slow ( k 2 ) components of bi-exponential to the photocurrent rise at 1 sun equivalent light intensity following reverse bias at −0.5 V in the dark (open circles and squares, respectively). The activation energy of the fast component evaluated between −9.5 and 50 °C was
E A =0.62 eV. The activation energy for the slow component evaluated between 15 and 50 °C was
E A =0.60 eV (the measurement duration was insufficient to reliably estimate the slow component at lower temperatures). The photocurrent rise at 50 °C did not reach a stable plateau and started to decline after its peak; we did not fit to this portion of the curve. The red crosses show the rates inferred from a single exponential fit to the tail of the photocurrent decay ( k 3 ) following forward bias at 1 V in the dark; the corresponding activation energy is 0.68 eV (red line) evaluated between 15 and 50 °C. Given the spread of points, we consider that the range of activation energies determined is similar to the uncertainty of the estimation. Full size image The measured activation energies for hysteresis, 0.60–0.68 eV, are very close to the value calculated for the migration of iodide ion vacancies, 0.58 eV. Our measured and calculated values are also compatible with experimental ionic conductivity studies of inorganic perovskites, which have reported similar activation energies for halide-ion vacancy conduction in perovskite halides (for example, CsPbCl 3 ) 35 , 36 , 37
and oxide-ion vacancy transport in perovskite oxides 33 , 34 . In contrast, the activation energies calculated for the migration of MA +
and Pb 2+
vacancies (0.84 and 2.31 eV, respectively) are higher than the measured values, confirming that significant migration of these ions is unlikely at the temperatures and timescales examined. The diffusion length of an iodide vacancy on the timescale of a photocurrent relaxation at room temperature (around 10 s) using our estimated diffusion coefficient (10 −12  cm 2  s −1 ) is of the order of 30 nm. The corresponding drift distance in this time due to an electric field that might be found in a device of this thickness (1 V dropped uniformly across 500 nm) is around 80 nm. As an example, the change in potential across a layer of accumulated vacancies of thickness
w
of 10 nm yields a value of ≈0.6 V, using the relation
qw 2 N /(2 ɛ 0 ɛ r ) assuming a relative permittivity ( ɛ r ) of 24 and 0.4% Schottky defects ( N ≈1.6 × 10 19  cm −3 ) at room temperature 41 . Hence, a change of this magnitude in electric potential in the perovskite adjacent to electrodes would certainly result in a significant variation in the observed photocurrent in a solar cell. Migration of iodide ion vacancies under the influence of an electric field could change the photogenerated charge collection efficiency of devices with time and so helps to explain hysteresis. The possible influence of iodide ion vacancies on band energies of a perovskite thin film device and its interfaces is described in
Figure 5 . We suggest the following model to explain the chronophotoamperometry measurements (see
Fig. 5b ). When the cell is short-circuited, a built-in electric field is present in the perovskite layer due to the difference in the work functions of the contacts. This could result in the migration of iodide ion vacancies towards the contacts (while immobile vacancies remain fixed), partially screening the field. As discussed above, we expect the magnitude of the short-circuit photocurrent to be controlled by the extent to which the electric field is screened (as also recently suggested by Tress
et al. 17 ). A reduced internal field within the device (due to ionic screening) would lead to less efficient collection of photogenerated charge carriers. Prolonged poling of the device under forward bias reduces (or reverses) the built-in field, which could allow a dissipation of ionic charge from the contacts by diffusion. This tempering would result in more efficient collection of photogenerated charges when the device is returned to short circuit, since the built-in field is no longer screened by accumulated ionic or vacancy charge. Conversely, holding the device under reverse bias would accentuate the migration of ions and vacancies to the interfaces, resulting in less efficient collection of photogenerated charges when the device is returned to short circuit. Figure 5: Influence of iodide ion vacancies on band energies of a perovskite thin film. ( a ) Schematic diagrams indicating the influence of vacancy drift on the band energies of a p-i-n device at short circuit.
E C
is the conduction band energy,
E V
is the valence band energy and
V bi
is the built-in potential. Iodide ion vacancies are represented by the squares with ‘plus’ signs. Implicit in the diagram is that the vacancies with effective positive charges are balanced by immobile cation vacancies (not shown) with effective negative charges. ( b ) Hypothesized energy level configurations corresponding to different bias conditions and times during the chronophotoamperometry measurements. The variation in the conduction and valence bands corresponds to the redistribution of iodide ion vacancies to and from interfaces with different applied potentials and times. Full size image Within this model, the rate at which the short-circuit photocurrent relaxes towards equilibrium following poling, under either forward or reverse bias, gives an indication of the rate of ion diffusion. The temperature dependence of iodide ion migration would then correspond to the measured activation energy. The agreement between the measured and predicted activation energies supports ionic transport as one of the primary causes of the anomalous hysteresis in current–voltage curves 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , and the giant switchable photovoltaic effect 32 . The detailed behaviour may be more complex owing to additional contributions from, for example, electronic charge redistribution (at faster timescales). Although this investigation is not exhaustive in terms of possible polarization phenomena and direct observation of ion migration, it does highlight a crucial area for further work on this fascinating system. Indeed, large-scale molecular dynamics simulations could be used to explore diffusion mechanisms and defect association effects, while isotope diffusion measurements would provide a direct probe for determining the extent of ion transport in these materials. Discussion Our combined computational and experimental study has provided new atomic-scale insights into the ion transport mechanisms operating in the hybrid perovskite CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 . We find facile vacancy-assisted diffusion of iodide ions, with good agreement with activation energies derived from kinetic measurements on a CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 -based solar cell. A key factor influencing the conduction of iodide ions (as the majority ionic carriers) will be the levels of intrinsic iodide ion vacancies in the material, which will be sensitive to the fabrication conditions and sample thermal history. Our study provides a framework for understanding ionic transport phenomena in organic–inorganic halide perovskites, including the influence of the migration of iodide ion vacancies to and from interfaces in solar cell devices. Such ion migration has been suggested as a factor contributing to their unusual behaviour, including current–voltage hysteresis and a giant dielectric response at low frequencies. The picture emerging is that hybrid halide perovskites are mixed ionic–electronic conductors. This behaviour has major repercussions for interpreting solar cell device performance and degradation pathways, and for the design of future architectures. Methods Computational The theoretical framework for modelling ion transport in the solid state is well developed 53 , and has been extensively validated for perovskite oxides 52 , 54 . The CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
perovskite structure and energies were calculated using density functional theory methods (employing the
ab initio
code VASP 58 ). A 4 × 4 × 4 supercell (768 atoms) of the pseudo-cubic unit cell was modelled; a plane wave cutoff energy of 500 eV,
k -point sampling at the gamma point, PAW pseudopotentials 59
and the PBEsol exchange-correlation functional were employed. For structure relaxation, forces were converged to <0.01 eV Å −1 . For the hybrid perovskites, PBEsol reproduces the experimental crystal structure in good agreement with neutron diffraction data, and also describes the finite temperature behaviour (lattice vibrations and dynamics) in agreement with Raman and neutron scattering. We obtained an average lattice parameter of 6.28 Å for CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 , in good agreement with the observed values of 6.28–6.32 Å from X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments ( Table 2 ) 11 , 55 , 60 , 61 . The defect results using PBEsol are very similar to those using other functionals, for example, see discussions of LDA/PBE in ref.
50 . For migration barriers, the expanded lattice volume for standard GGA functionals (such as PBE) could be a major source of error, which PBEsol avoids. Table 2 Structural parameters of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 . Full size table Activation energies for diffusion processes can be computed from the total energy difference between the diffusing species in their ground-state configuration and at the saddle point of the diffusion process. Migration mediated by ion vacancies was examined using nudged elastic band and constrained energy minimization methods 58 ; in the latter, the migrating species is propagated along the migration direction in a series of small steps with all unconstrained degrees of freedom relaxed at each step. While in a cubic lattice with disordered CH 3 NH 3 +
ions, each iodine site is equivalent, for an ordered cell that we used there are distinct apical and equatorial positions. We previously confirmed 41
that the vacancy formation energy is similar on both sites; here, we performed nudged elastic band calculations involving each iodine position, and find that the resulting activation energies are within 0.01 eV, and also insensitive to the alignment of methylammonium ions. Solar cell fabrication Methylammonium lead iodide solar cells were fabricated using a modification of standard recipes 5 . Fluorine-doped tin oxide (F:SnO 2 )-coated glass (TEC 15, Hartford Glass Co. Inc.) was patterned by etching with zinc powder and 2 M HCl, cleaned with deionized H 2 O, isoproponal and heated at 450 °C for 30 min. A dense titanium dioxide ( ∼ 80 nm) blocking layer (d-TiO 2 ) was deposited on SnO 2 :F glass substrates via spray pyrolysis and heated at 450 °C for 30 min 62 . A solution of 2.64 M methylammonium iodide and 0.88 M lead chloride in dry DMF was spun at 2,000 r.p.m. (acceleration 1,000 r.p.m. s −1 ) onto the substrate and dried at room temperature for 30 min before heating at 90 °C for 3 h in a glove box. Studies suggest that negligible chloride remains in the film following this preparation. The resulting CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
perovskite film thickness was
∼ 500 nm. A solution of 61.6 mM spiro-OMeTAD, 55 mM tBP and 26 mM LiTFSI in dry chlorobenzene was then spun onto the perovskite, as above, to create the hole-transporting layer. A gold electrode was evaporated onto this with an active area of 0.08 cm 2 . The cell was sealed in the glove box using a glass coverslip and a surlyn gasket. Kinetic measurements Chronophotoampereometry measurements were made using the TRACER system 15 , 63 . The current and voltage were measured while bias light (from white light-emitting diodes), applied voltage and short-circuit/open-circuit status were modulated in an arbitrary sequence of steps. The modulation was accomplished with three MOSFET switches possessing <1 μs switching time and synchronicity (for both the optical and electrical steps). The temperature of the cells was controlled to within ±1 °C using a Peltier cooler/heater to which the devices were coupled using thermal paste. Devices were stabilized for 5 min at each temperature before measurement. Illumination by the light-emitting diodes was also found to result in <1 °C temperature increase of the device. The chronophotoampereometry measurement sequence was as follows. The current through the cell was recorded with a reverse bias of −0.5 V for 102 s, the device was then switched to short-circuit mode (0 V) and the light simultaneously turned on (with 1 sun equivalent absorbed photon flux) for a further 102 s. The light was then turned off and a forward bias of 1 V was simultaneously applied to the cell for 102 s. The cell was then returned to short-circuit mode (0 V) and the light simultaneously switched on for a final 102 s. Empirically, the rise in the photocurrent ( J sc ) towards equilibrium ( J sc,equilibrium ) after reverse bias was found to be well fit by a double exponential function: where
t
is the time after switching,
k 1
and
k 2
are the rate constants (units: s −1 ) for the fast and slow phases of the rise and
J 1
and
J 2
are constants. The decay of the photocurrent towards equilibrium was observed to have a more complicated functional form with a shoulder in the decay at early times. The tail of this decay could be well fit by a single exponential function: where
k 3
is the rate constant for the decay and
J 3
is a constant. As discussed in the main text, we hypothesize that these phenomenological rates of photocurrent relaxation ( k 1 ,
k 2
and
k 3 ) are related to the formation or removal of energetic barriers in the material, which change the efficiency of photogenerated charge carrier collection 17 . The barriers result from the motion of ionic charge to or from the interfaces following a change in the electric field across the device caused by switching the bias voltage state. Measurements were taken as a function of temperature ( T ) from 263 to 323 K, representative of device-operating temperatures but below the tetragonal-to-cubic phase transition. Associated activation energies ( E A ) were determined by fitting the expression ln[ k ]= C — E A /( k B
T ) to an Arrhenius plot of the rate ( k ) data, where
C
is a constant and
k B
is Boltzmann’s constant. Although the activation energies are derived from the rates of photocurrent relaxation, they are likely to be related to the underlying mechanism that causes the change in photocurrent. Additional information How to cite this article:

Abstract Perovskite solar cells have demonstrated the efficiencies needed for technoeconomic competitiveness. With respect to the demanding stability requirements of photovoltaics, many techniques have been used to increase the stability of perovskite solar cells, and tremendous improvements have been made over the course of a decade of research. Nevertheless, the still-limited stability of perovskite solar cells remains to be fully understood and addressed. In this Review, we summarize progress in single-junction, lead-based perovskite photovoltaic stability and discuss the origins of chemical lability and how this affects stability under a range of relevant stressors. We highlight categories of prominent stability-enhancing strategies, including compositional tuning, barrier layers and the fabrication of stable transport layers. In the conclusion of this Review, we discuss the challenges that remain, and we offer a perspective on how the field can continue to advance to 25-year and 30-year stable perovskite solar modules.

Introduction Because of their remarkable properties, metal-halide perovskite (MHP) semiconductors have ushered in a new era of solar cell research. MHPs form an ABX 3
structure in which the A site is a monovalent cation (typically a mixture of caesium, methylammonium or formamidinium), the B site is a divalent metal (usually Pb or Sn) and the X site is a pure halide or mixture of halides (I, Br, Cl) (Fig.  1a ). Owing to their large absorption coefficients, high mobilities, long diffusion lengths and tunability, polycrystalline thin films of perovskite have been used to fabricate perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with bandgaps from 1.2 to 2.3 eV (refs.
1 , 2 ) and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) approaching 26% (~1.5 eV) 3 . Metal-halide perovskites are commonly known to have intrinsic defect tolerance, but modest temperatures (≥60 °C) can cause perovskite crystal decomposition 4 , 5 , and 1-sun illumination can break bonds to induce degradation 6 , 7 . Unsurprisingly, the time taken for early PSCs to drop to 80% of their original performance (their
T 80
lifetime) was only a few hours 8 . Since then, great strides have been made, and some PSCs have demonstrated thousands of hours of operational stability at ≥65 °C with negligible PCE loss 9 , 10 . Despite these improvements, the fundamental understanding of instabilities and the mechanisms behind stability-enhancing methods are often overlooked.

CC BY 4.0 . Full size image In this Review, we focus on lead-based perovskites used in single-junction PSCs. First, we discuss the special properties of perovskite materials and the major advances in PSC stability. Then we discuss the factors affecting PSC stability, the techniques used thus far to combat them, and potential routes to further improvement. Several reports have demonstrated encapsulation that renders humidity and oxygen effects negligible on timescales up to 1 year (ref.
11 ). Hence, it seems reasonable to consider moisture and oxygen ingress separately as an encapsulation issue. The need for robust, long-term encapsulation techniques and the best ways to encapsulate PSCs are discussed at length elsewhere 12 . Here, we instead focus on illumination, bias and temperature-based degradation. Differences between perovskites and traditional semiconductors Perovskites and traditional semiconductors (such as Si, CdTe and III–V semiconductors) have several key differences (Fig.  1a,b ) that ultimately affect their stability. Paramount to the success of perovskites is their defect tolerance, a result of their band structure (Fig.  1a , right). In typical semiconductors, the valence band maximum (VBM) is formed from bonding orbitals and the conduction band minimum (CBM) from antibonding orbitals 13 . When these bonds are broken, dangling bonds form close to where the original bonds were, creating defects deep within the semiconductor bandgap (Fig.  1b , right). Perovskites instead form their bandgap from antibonding orbitals at both the VBM and CBM, and thus breaking these bonds produces states away from the bandgap, either shallow defects or states within the valence band. The upshot of this is that polycrystalline perovskite films with defect densities 10 6
times greater than single-crystal silicon can produce similar solar cell performance 14 . The downside is that high defect densities reduce the energy needed for ions to migrate through the film, and defects tend to propagate over time, resulting in faster degradation of the absorber 15 . A second important difference between perovskites and traditional semiconductors is the lone pair effect. The divalent metal B site (usually Pb or Sn) forms with a lone pair of electrons that dictates the local geometry of the perovskite lattice 16
(Fig.  1c ). Similarly to how a water molecule is bent by the lone electron pairs on the oxygen, the perovskite lattice is distorted by the lone pair on the B site. However, rather than distorting to one specific orientation (like in the case of water), several local minima exist, and at room temperature the perovskite lattice is continually moving and reorienting. This behaviour is not clearly resolved by X-ray diffraction, which reveals the average lattice spacing, but is obvious in the Raman spectra of perovskites, which at room temperature appear similar to fluids 17
(Fig.  1d ). The dynamic nature of the perovskite lattice has many profound consequences for its stability. The thermal expansion coefficients of metal-halide perovskites are typically 10 times that of silicon, which is an important consideration when evaluating the mismatch in expansion and thus strain between perovskite and contacts. Additionally, the dynamic lattice increases the density of interstitials and vacancies, and aids ion migration 16 . Ion migration is of great consequence in perovskite photovoltaics. High defect densities generate high ion densities (up to 10 17  cm −3 ) (ref.  18 ) and provide pathways for ion migration through the lattice or along grain boundaries. The ion migration energy of halides is lower than for cations or metal species 19 , meaning halide drift is generally attributed as the reason that perovskites act as both electronic and ionic conductors. PSCs are typically made by sandwiching a mostly intrinsic perovskite semiconductor layer between an electron-transport layer (ETL) and a hole-transport layer (HTL). Mobile ions in the perovskite migrate to the interfaces until they screen the built-in electric field that would normally exist when a semiconductor with a relatively low carrier density is between electrodes with different work functions. If the voltage across a PSC is changed so quickly that the ions cannot redistribute fast enough, then, depending on the direction of the voltage scan, the field can either be larger than normal (which favours electron extraction) or it can point in the wrong direction (which hinders electron extraction) 18 . On initial testing, hysteresis is measured between forward and reverse current–voltage ( J–V ) scans with strong dependency on scan speed 20 , 21 . In the long term, ion redistribution results in a loss of current over time due to either flattening bands at the device interface or a build-up of insulating interface material 22 . More troublingly, we now know that in iodide-based MHPs, the density of mobile ions is increased under illumination. As the VBM is formed from iodide bonds, photogenerated holes could oxidize iodide to make neutral iodine interstitials and iodide vacancies (Fig.  1e ) causing several knock-on effects: iodine interstitials act as recombination centres and, because iodide vacancies are conductive, they move towards the interfaces 23 , 24 , I 2
gas is produced and can leave the perovskite, and iodine ions diffuse into charge-transport layers (CTLs) where they can react with metal electrodes, reducing conductivity 25
(Fig.  1f ). Another phenomenon that affects perovskite stability is phase segregation under illumination. For most perovskites in the family AB[I 1− x Br x ] 3 , iodine and bromine can be mixed uniformly for
x
ranging from 0 to 1. However, typically when
x
is greater than 20–33%, the perovskite phase separates into iodide-rich and bromide-rich regions under illumination 26 . The characteristic demonstration of this phase segregation is redshifted photoluminescence. When the film absorbs light, electrons and holes migrate to (lower-energy) iodide-rich regions, and as segregation progresses, the photoluminescence redshifts over time (Fig.  1g ). The fundamental driver for segregation is debated, some suggesting it is thermodynamic in origin 27 , 28 , others suggesting it is the result of polaron-induced lattice strain 29 , 30
or charge carrier gradients 31 , 32 . Some consensus is emerging that iodide is oxidized by photogenerated holes and has a higher mobility than bromine, and this sets up the opportunity for halide segregation 33 , 34 . Regardless, phase segregation limits the potential open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of ≥1.7-eV-bandgap PSCs necessary for tandem photovoltaics. Device stability so far The PCE of PSCs now rivals that of Si photovoltaics (PV), and thus device stability is of utmost importance. The stability of PSCs depends on many factors (ageing condition, perovskite composition, CTLs, electrodes, encapsulation and passivation) and is thus a complex issue. Considering ageing conditions alone, a consensus statement on stability testing of PSCs was made in 2020 (ref.
35 ), and researchers are encouraged to use the ISOS testing protocols to enable comparison between studies. PSCs are classified into two architectural configurations: conventional (n–i–p) and inverted (p–i–n) structures (Fig.  2a,b ). Figure  2c
shows a timeline of PSCs, comparing record certified efficiency in n–i–p and p–i–n cells along with reported stability. We find that even though the efficiency of the record n–i–p devices has improved hugely in the past decade, their stability has improved relatively slowly (Box
1 ). Some reports on record devices are without stability measurements, others use different device fabrication with lower efficiency for stability testing and those that use the same architecture record
T 80
lifetimes at room temperature of only a few hundred hours 36 . These results give the impression that poor stability is abundant among the best PSCs. Scrutinizing further, one finds that the situation is more positive. The stability of record p–i–n devices, for example, has vastly improved, with devices demonstrating stability under illumination and heat (ISOS-L2/3) with
T 80  > 1,000 h from initial PCEs >23%. It should be noted that similarly high stability has been demonstrated in n–i–p, but not with record efficiency 8 , 10 , 22 . Indeed, we also notice that many impressive stability milestones have been achieved. These are generally accomplished with low-efficiency devices first, and a few years is taken to achieve the same stability in a device with record efficiency.

1 . Full size image Factors other than ageing condition that affect perovskite stability are often considered separately from efficiency, with many reports using CTLs or metal contacts for their stability testing that are different from those used to obtain their best PCEs. This is particularly popular in n–i–p devices where the hole-transporting material (HTM) spiro-OMeTAD is replaced with more stable HTMs 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 . This causes two problems: stability is achieved with significantly lower (often unreported) PCEs than the best efficiencies, and cells are optimized for efficiency using spiro-OMeTAD when these optimizations may not be beneficial using other CTLs. As the field matures, it is important to combine stability with efficiency, considering how best to optimize devices within a stable architecture. Another development is outdoor perovskite stability testing. Initially, real-world testing produced
T 80
lifetimes of only a few days 41 . More recently, however, the use of lamination-based glass–glass encapsulation has produced cells with no PCE degradation after 10 months of maximum-power- point (MPP) tracking outdoors in Berlin 42
(Fig.  2c ). A small-scale (~3-m 2
active area) perovskite solar farm with lamination encapsulation and an initial efficiency ~12.5% PCE was tested over the course of a year, with a recorded
T 80
of 5,832 h (8 months) following the ISOS-O3 protocol 43 . These results indicate that the lifetime of PSCs is increasing beyond what is practically assessable, and there is a need to move from standard test conditions towards accelerated testing. Box 1 The Perovskite Database An open-access database of perovskite solar cell (PSC) results has been generated with data from >40,000 devices published between 2012 and 2020 (ref.
198 ), most of which have no stability data associated with them. Still, there are >1,000 devices with stability referenced to the ISOS protocols, which we used to generate the figure. Panel
a
of the figure compares stability over time from all PSCs in the Perovskite Database with corresponding ISOS protocols. The data are understandably noisy, as there are various perovskite compositions, device architectures and ageing parameters included. The trendline still demonstrates an increase in
T 80
lifetime from ~10 h to ~100 h over 6 years. However, noise brought about by the huge volume of studies under-represents the stability gains. Looking instead at only PSCs aged under illumination (see the figure, panel
b ), the increase in stability from 2015 to 2020 becomes more obvious, probably because this is a more intense ageing test in which early devices fared poorly. To update the Perovskite Database statistics, we added 26 data points from recent high-impact studies from 2021 onwards (Supplementary Table
2 ). From these data, we can see that in modern studies, 1,000 h operational stability is readily achievable. This higher stability becomes particularly obvious when one realizes that only 4 of the 26 devices decayed to 80% of their original efficiency during stability testing. For the other 22, the number recorded is either the
T 90 ,
T 95
or
T 100
lifetime. Indeed, with lifetimes extending well beyond 1,000 h, researchers are turning to accelerated ageing to assess stability, evidenced by the fact that 15 of the 26 devices were tested above room temperature (45 °C to 85 °C). Panel
c
of the figure compares n–i–p and p–i–n cell stability. Considering cell configuration, we find that (when normalized to ISOS-L1 conditions using a simple acceleration factor model discussed in Supplementary Note  1 ) there is little difference in stability on average between n–i–p and p–i–n devices, which is surprising, as many state the stability of transport layers in p–i–n as an advantage of the configuration 141 , 158 , 199 . Still, this equivalence is bolstered when considering our 26 recent data points with high stability, which are evenly spread between n–i–p and p–i–n (Supplementary Fig.
1 ). Finally, we find that the vast majority of PSC stability is reported in cells with bandgaps from ~1.5 eV to 1.65 eV (panel
d
of the figure). This result is unsurprising as most PSC research is in this range, but demonstrates the need for more work in the areas of low-bandgap (~1.2 eV Pb/Sn) and wide-bandgap (~1.8 eV) cells that are used in all-perovskite tandems. Although not the subject of this Review, it should be noted that in Pb-free, Sn-containing perovskites, the oxidation of Sn( ii ) to Sn( iv ) results in poorer stability for narrow-bandgap PSCs 200 . Additionally, higher ionic conductivity and halide segregation hamper the stability of wide-bandgap films with >20% Br concentration 201 . Factors affecting PSC stability To understand the rapid increase in PSC stability and how to improve it further, we must first understand which materials and stressors contribute. Despite differences in configuration between n–i–p and p–i–n devices, both consist of similar layers: the electron-transporting layer (ETL), hole-transporting layer (HTL), perovskite light-absorbing layer, cathode and anode contacts (Fig.  2a,b ). Under different external stressors (that is, illumination, thermal and bias), the instability of each constituent layer and the interfaces between layers are both important factors leading to operational instability. Perovskite stability Inherent stability of perovskite structure/phase Before delving into the stability of full PSCs, we should examine the intrinsic stability of the perovskite structure. The majority of highly efficient PSCs are based on a 3D perovskite in a cubic crystal phase (also known as the α-phase). The Goldschmidt tolerance factor
τ
can be used to determine the stability of a given perovskite from the ionic radii of its constituent ions: $$\tau =({R}_{{\rm{A}}}+{R}_{{\rm{X}}})/\surd 2({R}_{{\rm{B}}}+{R}_{{\rm{X}}}),$$ where
R A ,
R B
and
R X
are the ionic radii of the corresponding ions. In general, if
τ
for a given perovskite composition is between 0.9 and 1.0, it forms an ideal cubic structure. If
τ
is between 0.71 and 0.9, it will form an orthorhombic structure around room temperature. For MHPs, it has been observed that if
τ  > 1 or
τ  < 0.8, then the lattice distortion generated induces a photo-inactive, non-perovskite structure to form, normally known as the δ-phase 44 . MAPbI 3
has a
τ
value of ~0.9 and an ideal cubic structure at room temperature. FAPbI 3
( τ
of ~1) is near the upper boundary for a cubic structure, so it has two phases at room temperature: cubic (α-phase) and hexagonal (δ-phase). High-temperature annealing (>433 K) is required to obtain α-phase FAPbI 3
(ref.
45 ), but δ-phase formation only needs a temperature of ~285 K (ref.
46 ). Because the δ-phase is more stable than the α-phase, it is difficult to stabilize cubic FAPbI 3 . By contrast,
τ
is approximately 0.8 for CsPbI 3 , which is close to the lower range for the cubic perovskite structure. The thermodynamically stable phase of CsPbI 3
at room temperature is the non-photoactive δ-phase, and the photoactive α-phase is obtained by high-temperature annealing of the δ-phase (>633 K) 47 . Perovskite degradation under thermal stress Some perovskite materials will undergo decomposition reactions under thermal stress. It is important to consider both operational temperatures (−40 °C to 75 °C; a temperature of 65 °C is commonly used as the upper end of PSC operating temperature, but there is evidence that this could be as high as 70–75 °C (refs.
43 , 48 ) and temperatures >75 °C for accelerated degradation testing. Note that temperatures used for accelerated ageing should not introduce a new decay mode that would not be observed below 75 °C. MAPbX 3
(X = Cl, Br, I) have low decomposition temperatures (<100 ˚C), with MAPbI 3
in particular degrading within the operational range (~60 °C), which is likely to preclude its use as a stable PSC material 49 . The thermal stability of FAPbI 3
is reportedly higher than MAPbI 3 . FAPbI 3
films exposed to 150 °C for 60 mins are stable without discoloration, whereas MAPbI 3
discolours after ~30 minutes 50 . This enhanced stability is attributed to the stronger interaction between FA +
and [PbI 6 ] 4+
compared with MA +
(ref.
51 ). Despite this, FAPbI 3
will undergo thermal decomposition at relatively low temperatures (>50 °C), where formamidinium iodide (FAI) decomposes into formamidine and HI 52
(Fig.  3a ). Both of these reactions are reversible and in a well-encapsulated device might not be fatal. When the temperature is around 95 °C, formamidine decomposes into
sym -triazine and ammonia through irreversible reactions 45
(Fig.  3a ). When the temperature exceeds the phase transition temperature of α-FAPbI 3
(160 °C), FAPbI 3
partially decomposes into PbI 2
as FAI evaporates to HCN and NH 3
(ref.
53 ). This degradation behaviour suggests that FAPbI 3
has potential as a stable PSC material between −40 °C and 75 °C, although accelerated ageing above 95 °C is likely to be non-representative. Fig. 3: Factors affecting perovskite solar cell stability. a , FAPbX 3

(1) Hole injection: halide vacancies drift towards the hole-transport layer (HTL), resulting in favourable band energetics for hole injection via trap-assisted tunnelling at the interface between the electron-transport layer (ETL) and perovskite. (2) Hole drift: a strong electric field pulls the holes away from the space charge region. Holes accumulate at the edge of the region where there is no net electric field. (3) Hole diffusion: a high concentration gradient of holes in the bulk results in diffusion of the holes towards the HTL. (4) Halide oxidation by holes: part of the holes that build up in the perovskite bulk oxidize halides into neutral halogens. (5) Hole extraction into the HTL. In this band diagram,

76 , RSC . Full size image Because CsPbI 3
does not contain volatile and decomposable organic components, it does not break down at low temperatures, and α-CsPbI 3
is stable at temperatures as high as 390 °C. Above this, PbI 2
volatilizes and leaves CsI as residue 54 . Hence, accelerated ageing beyond 300 °C is feasible, although the stability of other PSC layers would come into question. Perovskite degradation under illumination Ultraviolet and blue wavelengths have the strongest impact on PSC stability 55 . Perovskites rapidly decompose under illumination when oxygen is present, although without oxygen, illumination can still trigger decomposition through simultaneous reversible and permanent reactions 56 , 57 . Our discussion will focus on illumination without oxygen, assuming high-quality encapsulation. PbI 2
films degrade into metallic Pb 0
and I 2
gas under simulated sunlight (Xe lamp), with an activation energy ( E a ) of ~9 kcal mol −1 , or 0.4 eV per Pb atom 58 . The activation energy is increased by a factor of 6 (~57 kcal mol −1 ) on using a white-light LED. The degradation is retarded completely for photon energies less than 2.3 eV (ref.
59 ), which is the bandgap of PbI 2 , suggesting that degradation is caused by light absorption. For MAPbI 3
under a Xe lamp, the
E a
for Pb 0 /I 2
decomposition is lower than PbI 2
(~6 kcal mol −1 ) owing to the lower bandgap of MAPbI 3
and [PbI 6 ] octahedral distortion which produces shorter I–I bond distances, aiding the release of I 2
(ref.
58 ). Moreover, when MAPbI 3
is illuminated with energies higher than 450 nm, signals from CH 3 NH 2
and H 2
are detected, indicating that the N–H bond in the perovskite can dissociate under sunlight 60
(Fig.  3b ). Although most studies examining degradation under illumination have been carried out on MAPbI 3 , decomposition into Pb 0
has been witnessed in FACs perovskites also 61 . Most perovskites with a >20% Br to I ratio will segregate into I-rich and Br-rich regions under illumination 62 . Considering stability, the funnelling of charges into lower-bandgap (I-rich) regions effectively reduces the maximum
V OC
of wide-bandgap devices, resulting in a ~10% decrease in
V OC
over the first hour or so of operation 27 , 63 . Illumination can also induce a similar process in mixed-cation perovskites in which cations aggregate leading to phase transitions. Density functional theory simulations indicate that cation aggregation in a FA 0.89 Cs 0.11 PbI 3
perovskite with a uniform distribution of cations can be triggered with relatively little energy (0.133 kJ mol −1 ) (ref.
64 ). Perovskite degradation under bias In a solar module, partial shading by neighbouring trees, dirt or snow prevents some of the cells from generating photocurrent 65 . Because all cells must pass the same amount of current for the panel to generate power, the cells that are illuminated put the shaded cells into whatever reverse bias is needed for current matching to occur. Cells in reverse bias have both short-term reversible and irreversible degradation problems. Several interesting observations have been made on the reverse-bias behaviour of perovskite solar cells. When metal electrodes are used, the metal filaments grow all the way through the device under reverse bias to create a shunt 66 . In a reverse-bias current–voltage scan, the current increases very suddenly when the shunt forms, and localized heating is observed with thermal imaging 67 , 68 . The extreme heating at the shunt causes permanent damage to most layers of the cell. By contrast, this behaviour is not seen when transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) and carbon electrodes are used. In these cells, there is an exponential increase in current that starts typically between −1 V and −4 V when sweeping the voltage to increasing negative values. This current is enabled by the tunnelling of holes from the electron-transport layer due to strong band bending associated with mobile ions redistributing to screen the applied field. After current is passed through a cell in reverse bias for as little as a minute, the efficiency can be reduced by more than 50%. Much, but not all, of this efficiency recovers if the cell is exposed to 1 sun at a positive voltage for approximately 30 minutes. The rapid degradation most likely occurs because the hole density while passing the short-circuit current density in reverse bias is similar to what it would be at the MPP under 1-sun illumination, but the electron density is nearly zero. Consequently, the holes can oxidize iodide more rapidly to form smaller neutral iodine species that can move to interstitial sites, creating a vacancy in the process. With few electrons being present, the reverse reaction is slow. The iodine interstitials act as recombination centres, which greatly reduces the efficiency of the cell. During the recovery process at positive voltage, the iodine interstitials are reduced and return to the octahedral corners. The recovery only occurs, however, if the iodine species stay in the perovskite film. For this reason, internal barriers that confine the iodine to the perovskite are critically important. If strategies for preventing degradation in reverse bias are not found, then engineering solutions for preventing degradation due to partial shading will be needed. In silicon solar panels, strings of cells are protected by a few bypass diodes that are located in the junction box. The current can be routed to the diodes through metal ribbons. The approach could be used relatively easily in panels made with perovskite–silicon tandems 69 . The breakdown voltage of the tandem is the sum of the breakdown voltages of the subcells. Many tandems can be protected by one bypass diode because of the high breakdown voltage of silicon. It is not clear, however, how to use bypass diodes in thin-film panels in which cells with a length greater than a metre are separated from each other by laser scribes. If one of these cells were shaded, some of the current would have to travel as far as the length of the cell to get to the bypass diode on the edge of the panel and then travel back. One of the electrodes would probably be a TCO, and the voltage drop over such a large distance would be excessive. It is for this reason that bypass diodes are typically not used in commercial CdTe solar panels. It is quite possible that the degradation in reverse bias is similar in nature to what happens under 1 sun at the MPP in good solar cells that do not have weaknesses associated with poor packaging, mobile additives or reactive electrodes. Because degradation in reverse bias is approximately 100,000 times faster, it might offer an excellent way to test new materials and processing conditions rapidly to assess their impact on stability. In particular, reverse biasing can be used to generate mobile iodine in order to assess barrier quality (Fig.  3c ). Effect of defects on PSC stability A large number of defects are generated during perovskite crystallization. Defect densities >10 14  cm − 3
have been reported for optimized perovskite thin films 70 , most of which appear at surfaces and grain boundaries. Perovskite composition and fabrication conditions have a substantial influence on defect type and concentration 71 . The primary defects affecting PSC performance are point defects at grain boundaries or surfaces 72 , including antisites (MA Pb , MA I , Pb MA , I MA
and I Pb ), interstitials (MA i , Pb i
and I i ) and vacancies (V MA ,V Pb
and V I ) 73
(Fig.  3d ). MHPs are defect-tolerant materials, but even shallow defects can lead to non-radiative recombination and reduce
V OC , albeit to a much lesser extent than traditional semiconductors. More important to stability, defects aid ion migration, meaning that defects migrate 74
(Fig.  3e–h ), accumulate and propagate leading to irreversible degradation 75 . Calculations of ion migration activation energies find that halide ions contribute the most to ion migration (5 times as much as MA or Pb, for example 76 ). Ion migration energies vary due to measurement, perovskite composition, defect densities and PSC fabrication, but values between 0.1 eV and 0.9 eV have been reported 10 , 77 , 78 , 79 . Typically, these values are calculated as a function of temperature only, but ion migration is governed by temperature and illumination. For example, ion migration activation energy has been observed to decrease substantially (0.29 eV to 0.1 eV) when films are under low-intensity illumination (10 mW cm −2 ) (ref.
80 ). Defects also collect and trap carriers, inducing irreversible degradation of perovskite 81 , 82 . Two deep-level trap bands, I (0.27 eV) and II (0.36 eV), have been observed in iodine-based PSCs, which correspond to iodide interstitials (I i −
and I i + ). Under reverse bias, a trap-filling process occurs between I i −
and the injected holes (h + ) to form I i 0 . I i 0
can be oxidized to I i +
by valence band oxidation 83
or can form I 2
through a bimolecular reaction, which induces iodide loss and leads to irreversible degradation 67 , 84 . Effect of metal electrodes on PSC stability Most highly efficient PSCs use a metal top electrode; gold is the most-used electrode in n–i–p devices, but copper or silver is more common for p–i–n devices. Metal electrodes are easily corroded by halides that migrate from the perovskite layer, which reduces conductivity over time. Furthermore, metal ions generated by corrosion can migrate into the perovskite, accelerating PSC degradation 85 . For example, iodide on perovskite film surfaces can diffuse through CTLs to the surface of a silver electrode. The ions react with silver and form silver iodide (AgI), an insulating layer that hinders charge transport 86 . The opposite is also possible. Au −
can migrate through spiro-OMeTAD into the perovskite layer under 70 °C annealing to induce perovskite degradation 87 . It is believed that under illumination, the ion migration in perovskites is reversible and does not cause permanent degradation. However, when ions, especially halides, migrate to a metal electrode and react, this causes irreversible degradation 88 . Effect of charge-transport layers on PSC stability For highly efficient PSCs, charge-transport layers (CTLs) are indispensable. Any physical or chemical alteration of the transport layer material, the perovskite–CTL interface 89
or the CTL–electrode interface can affect the long-term stability of PSCs 90 . For example, TiO 2 , a common electron-transporting material in n–i–p PSCs, has abundant oxygen vacancy defects (Ti 3+
sites, especially at the surface) that are effectively deep electron-donating sites. In the presence of ultraviolet light, iodide ions at the perovskite–TiO 2
interface can be oxidized into iodine, resulting in the decomposition of the perovskite 91 . NiOx and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) can undergo photo- or chemical reactions with lead halides. By contrast, pentathienoacene (PTA) and polybisphenyl(trimethylphenyl)amine (PTAA) seem inert to lead halides 92 . Currently, spiro-OMeTAD-based PSCs hold the record for single-junction PSC efficiency. Pristine spiro-OMeTAD has intrinsically low hole mobility. As such, it is necessary to increase the hole mobility by adding additives, with the most-used additives being lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) and
tert -butylpyridine ( t BP) 93 , 94 . Although Li-TFSI and
t BP improve PSC performance, they also bring challenges to long-term stability:
t BP can corrode the perovskite layer through reaction with PbI 2 , and Li +
in Li-TFSI can diffuse into the perovskite interior and decompose the perovskite structure 95 , 96 , 97 . Strategies for stable PSCs Several stability-enhancing strategies have been developed, such as increasing ion migration energies and crystal stability through alloying, protecting the perovskite and CTLs from external stressors and passivating interfacial defects using barrier layers, decreasing defect density and suppressing ion migration using functional additives, and using robust CTLs (Figs.  4
and
5 ).

Full size image Perovskite phase stabilization A-cation alloying The A site in the perovskite crystal structure does not directly affect the band edge states as these states are formed from Pb and halide orbitals. It does, however, affect the bandgap indirectly through changes to octahedral tilting or distortion of the MX 6
framework, which changes the B–X bond length and induces VBM and CBM changes 98 , 99
(Fig.  4a ). Indeed, as the size and geometry of the A cation affects the bond length and bond angle of the perovskite crystal, it has great influence on the crystal stability and the electrical properties of the perovskite. FAPbI 3
has a narrower bandgap (1.48 eV) than that of MAPbI 3
(1.6 eV) (Fig.  4a ), so FAPbI 3 -based perovskites are preferred as their bandgap is closer to optimal for maximum device efficiency (1.34 eV) 100 . Indeed, the majority of high-efficient PSCs are FAPbI 3 -rich recipes. However, as the tolerance factor for FAPbI 3
is close to 1, FAPbI 3
will naturally lose its cubic phase at room temperature. To stabilize α-FAPbI 3 , partial replacement of FA +
with smaller-radii cations (MA + , Cs + , Rb + ) is used. The introduction of MA +
enables the perovskite to obtain its α-phase at a lower temperature than pristine FAPbI 3
(ref.
101 ), but is generally thought to decrease the light and thermal stability of FAPbI 3
perovskite as MA +
is more volatile than FA +
(ref.
102 ). Counterintuitively, up to ~10% MA incorporation has been shown to improve stability 22 , 103 . Partially replacing FA +
with smaller-radii cations such as Cs +
not only stabilizes α-FAPbI 3
but also improves thermal stability due to the strong chemical bonding between Cs +
and [PbI 6 ] 4+ . Cs 0.1 FA 0.9 PbI 3
has shown better photo- and moisture stability than FAPbI 3 . This stability is attributed to the introduction of Cs + , which shrinks the perovskite crystal cubo-octahedral volume and increases the A-site-I bond energy 102 . To further improve stability, complex mixed-cation systems have also been explored, such as CsMAFA and RbCsMAFA. Adding more elements increases the entropy of mixing to stabilize the perovskite phase 40 , 104 . Various other methods to stabilize α-FAPbI 3
have been discussed in the literature (for example using pseudo-halides 105
or using methylenediammonium 38
or isopropylammonium 106
as additives). For many of these, it is unclear whether perovskite alloying has occurred. Including a small amount of Cs +
or MA +
to stabilize FAPbI 3
results in a non-cubic perovskite crystal structure with an octahedral tilt of ~2° at room temperature 107 . This α-phase stabilization is not exclusive to alloying additives, as it can also be achieved by additives at the perovskite grain boundaries. Moreover, if alloying cations are unevenly distributed, nanoscale local regions of perovskite can lose their 2° tilt, forming regions of hexagonal polytypes that expand over time, and resulting in δ-phase formation 107 . Increasing the annealing temperature or the annealing time results in more homogenous mixing of A-site cations and higher PSC stability 108 . Introducing large-radius cations such as PEA +
or BA +
into FAPbI 3
perovskite is another important strategy to improve perovskite stability 109 . The exchange of large-radii cations leads to the collapse of the 3D perovskite crystal structure and the introduction of a quantum-confined, usually 2D structure 110 . If large A cations are mixed directly into the perovskite precursors, then a mixed, quasi-2D film containing various thicknesses of 2D and quasi-2D perovskite tends to form. This mixed film has enhanced stability due to an increased hydrophobicity and the presence of large-cation layers hindering ion transport, but lower efficiency due to an increased bandgap, decreased mobility and higher exciton binding energies 111 . Applying 2D perovskite atop the bulk 3D to passivate the surface and block ion transport out of the cell can be used to remediate these issues. A summary of operational stability enhancements from A-site alloying is found in Supplementary Table
3 . X-anion alloying Unlike the A-site cation, the X-site anion directly contributes to the band edge of the perovskite. Replacing I −
with Br −
or Cl −
can tune the bandgap, regulate perovskite grain growth and improve the chemical stability of perovskite films. Partially replacing I −
with Br −
can suppress the δ-phase formation of FA-rich or Cs-rich perovskites 112 , 113 , and perovskites with 5% Br have shown better
T 80
stability 22
(Fig.  4b ). The introduction of Cl −
into perovskite precursors can substantially improve the quality, morphology 114
and crystallinity of majority iodine perovskites, although whether Cl alloys into the perovskite is still debated and probably depends on various factors 115 . Introducing MACl into FAPbI 3
perovskite is one of most popular methods to prepare stable α-FAPbI 3
films 116 , as the Cl-containing perovskite system is more thermodynamically stable and the introduction of MA shrinks the volume of the FAPbI 3
crystal, which also improves the stability of the perovskite structure 117 . In wider-bandgap perovskites that contain important amounts of Cs and Br, the lattice parameters are smaller, and more chlorine can be incorporated on the X site 118 . These compounds are more stable against light-induced phase separation. All-inorganic perovskites All-inorganic perovskites (Cs,Rb)Pb(I,Br) 3
are more thermally stable than their hybrid counterparts. Because the bandgaps of all-inorganic perovskites are wider than those of FA-based perovskites, they are typically considered for tandem applications. The narrowest bandgap available is for CsPbI 3
(~1.7 eV), which is well matched for Si/perovskite tandems. Like for FAPbI 3 , the photoactive phase of CsPbI 3
is difficult to maintain at room temperature. Many strategies have been developed to stabilize α-CsPbI 3 : A-cation alloying, X-anion alloying and additive engineering. For example, 18-crown-6 ether has been used as an additive to stabilize the cubic phase of CsPbI 3 , and devices maintained
∼ 91% of their initial PCE after 1,000 h in N 2
at 85 °C (ref.
119 ). Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) has likewise been used, with PSCs showing no visible decrease in PCE after 3,500 h at 35 °C, and decreasing by only 20% after 2,100 h under continuous illumination at 110 °C (ref.
10 ) (Fig.  4c ). Although highly thermally stable, all-inorganic PSCs tend to suffer from lower efficiencies than their hybrid counterparts. These lower efficiencies have been attributed to high defect densities induced by fast crystallization, resulting in short carrier lifetimes and low photoluminescent quantum efficiency 120 . To improve efficiency, dimethylammonium has been used to stabilize the β-phase CsPbI 3
and to control perovskite crystallization 121 , and surface treatments have been used to reduce surface defect densities 120 . Using a CsF surface treatment, an all-inorganic PSC with a 1.74-eV bandgap achieved 21% PCE 122 , ~75% of the thermodynamic limit. The highest-performing hybrid perovskites can achieve >80% of this limit 123 , so there is some room for improvement. The carrier lifetimes recorded for these all-inorganic films are roughly one-quarter that of the highest-performing hybrid films (~700 ns compared with ~2,900 ns), suggesting that defect densities can be further reduced. Barrier layers for stable PSCs Barrier layers are thin layers deposited at interfaces within a PSC to improve efficiency and stability. These layers can protect from external stressors (such as moisture or ultraviolet light), passivate interface defects, block ion migration and inhibit interfacial chemical reactions 124 . CTL–electrode interface barrier layers The main function of a barrier layer at the CTL–anode interface is to block the migration of perovskite and metal ions crossing the interface without reducing conductivity. There are various barrier layers in use (metal oxides 125 , graphene 126
and organic self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) 127 ). An illustrative example is Au or Ag infiltration in PSCs aged at high temperature. Introducing 10 nm of chromium between a Au anode and the HTL entirely mitigates Au infiltration into the perovskite layer after 75 °C ageing under light, suggesting that Cr is an effective barrier to metal ion migration 87 . Alternatively, bismuth interlayers can protect metal electrodes from iodine corrosion or perovskite ingress, preventing all detectable Ag infiltration into the perovskite layer after ageing at 85 °C for 100 h under light. Bismuth-protected devices maintain 95% and 97% of their initial PCE after 500 h under 85 °C and light soaking conditions, respectively 128 . TCO electrodes such as indium tin oxide or indium zinc oxide can also reduce ion infiltration and increase stability. The most effective TCO layers are fabricated by sputter deposition, but high-energy sputtering can easily damage other layers. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) can remediate this issue as has been demonstrated with SnO 2
in both perovskite tandems and single-junction devices 129 . SnO 2
can act as a barrier layer in its own right, or in conjunction with a sputtered TCO layer 130 . Alternatively, one can replace metal electrodes with carbon electrodes to avoid degradation due to electrode corrosion or metal ion migration. Interface barrier layers are often used to improve the contact or energy-level alignment between the carbon electrode and the perovskite layer, partially offsetting the efficiency decrease caused by the carbon electrode 131 . Perovskite–CTL interface barrier layers The high surface defect density of perovskite films accelerates degradation while corrupting other layers through ion migration. Barrier layers that can passivate surface defects and block ion migration are highly attractive. Various materials have been demonstrated as perovskite–HTL interface barrier layers, including 2D materials 132 , quantum dots 133 , metal oxides 134 , 135 , functional polymers 136 , small molecular compounds 137 , 138
and ammonium salts 139 , 140 . The most popular passivation/barrier layer in modern PSCs is a layer of 2D perovskite, with several reports of good operational stability at ≥60 °C in 2022 alone 9 , 10 , 141 , 142 . For example, pure-phase 2D perovskite single crystals dispersed in acetonitrile were coated onto 3D perovskite to form a highly controllable 2D/3D interface. An advantage of 2D perovskite is its relatively high conductivity compared with other insulating barrier layers, meaning that layers up to 80 nm in thickness have been used without resistive losses 143 . Using a conformal 50-nm-thick 2D layer, devices with >23% PCE were fabricated, which also demonstrated
T 99  > 2,000 h following the ISOS-L1 (MPP, 60 °C) protocols, a large increase compared with control devices ( T 80
of ~500 h) 9
(Fig.  4d ). Depositing CsCl onto CsPbI 3
has been used to form an all-inorganic 2D/3D heterostructure (Fig.  4c ). This strategy increased the barrier to ion migration in PSCs by a factor of 2 and increased the
T 80
stability (ISOS-L3) by a factor of ~3 at 110 °C to >2,000 h. Device stability was measured at several temperatures and used to extrapolate the
T 80
lifetime at 35 °C to be ~5 years 10 . Using non-2D perovskite barrier layers, such as inorganic lead sulfate, also leads to impressive stability results. For example, although the ion migration energy of control devices is ~0.1 eV, no transition to ionic transport was observed in lead-sulfate-capped PSCs below 55 °C (Fig.  4e ). Using this technique produced >20% PCE cells with a
T 97  > 1,000 h at 65 °C (ISOS-L3) 80 . In addition, hybrid material ferrocenyl-bis-thiophene-2-carboxylate (FcTc 2 ) strongly binds to the perovskite surface and effectively prevents surface MA +
from escaping the film under light (1 sun) and heat (85 °C). Devices with PCE ~24% exhibited a
T 98
of 1,500 h (ISOS-L1, room temperature) 144 . Additive engineering Perovskite grain boundaries and surfaces are vital to the stability of PSCs as they contain the majority of defects, and these defects tend to propagate over time 15 , 145 . Reducing the density of defects at grain boundaries inhibits degradation and ion migration. Both functional materials and solvent additives can regulate crystallization to increase grain size and passivate grain boundaries 146 . This section investigates the effects of salts and organic compound additives on PSC stability. Additive salts A popular set of additives are organic ammonium halide salts. These additives exist in different formations at perovskite grain boundaries and surfaces. Some ammonium species form low-dimensional perovskites, which improve PSC stability by inhibiting ion migration 147 , 148 . Alternatively, organic cations with large molecular volumes, such as NH 3 I(CH 2 ) 8 NH 3 I, cannot form low-dimensional perovskite but can heal surface defects through hydrogen bonding, X-site vacancy passivation (halogens) and NH 3
groups binding to A-site vacancies or Pb−X antisite defects 2 , 149 . Ionic liquids (ILs) are increasingly used to improve the stability of PSCs through three mechanisms 150 . First, the ionic liquid reacts with PbI 2
to form an intermediate complex, which increases the activation barrier to perovskite nucleation growth, thus increasing grain size and reducing grain-boundary density. Next, the formation of hydrogen bonds between the ionic liquid and MA +
or FA +
inhibits relevant ion migration, thereby increasing PSC stability. Finally, ionic liquids have various functional groups that can passivate different perovskite surface defects, suppress ion migration and retard lead oxidation and the compositional segregation of perovskites. Formamidinium formate (FAHCOO) was used to fabricate >25% PCE PSCs with a
T 80
of 400 h (compared with 150 h for control devices) 105
(Fig.  4f ). Organic compounds as additives Organic compounds are some of the most commonly used perovskite additives. These materials contain N-donor, S-donor or O-donor groups. The electron lone pair of these groups can react with lead halide precursors to form complexes that, similarly to ionic liquids, retard the nucleation rate of perovskites and reduce the density of grain boundaries 151 . Concurrently, these electron donors effectively passivate perovskite defects, thereby improving the stability of PSCs. Some oligomer additives can also be used as linkers between grains to improve grain-boundary stability 152 . Besides the above functions, conjugated organic additives can modify energy-level alignment to promote carrier extraction at interfaces, inhibiting the accumulation of charges and improving stability 153 , 154 . A notable example is PMMA, which contains C=O functional groups. When PMMA is added to a perovskite precursor solution, an intermediate adduct is formed between C=O and PbI 2
(Fig.  4g ). The intermediate adduct formation effectively regulates the crystallization process of the perovskite and increases the perovskite crystal size considerably 155 . As another example, the theophylline molecule contains N–H and C = O functional groups. The N–H groups can form a hydrogen bond with iodine and assist the interaction of C=O with antisite Pb (lead) defects on the perovskite surface leading to suppressed ion migration, devices with theophylline showing better stability under operation 156 . It should be noted that there is currently no standard for evaluating which type of additive is better, nor is there any authoritative comparative study indicating additive hierarchy. At present, there is consensus in the field of PSCs that materials containing S, N, O or P atoms can form adducts through Lewis acid–base reactions with lead atoms, which regulate perovskite crystallization and reduce defects in perovskite films 151 , 157 . However, how best to compare the efficacy of different additives remains a problem for the field. Robust transport materials and relevant additives for stable PSCs For p–i–n PSCs and p–i–n-based tandem devices, the most commonly used HTLs (PTAA, NiOx and SAMs) have shown good stability 37 , 158 , and ALD SnOx as ETL can show good stability and high efficiency. For n–i–p devices, SnO 2
seems to effectively solve the instability induced by TiO 2
(ref.
159 ), but resolving the instability induced by spiro-OMeTAD while ensuring higher efficiency is a challenge 160 , 161 , 162 . Here we highlight work on improving the stability of spiro-OMeTAD and on the development of additive-free HTMs, as many HTM additives cause degradation when they diffuse into the perovskite. PSCs with record efficiency have consistently been fabricated in the n–i–p structure. Spiro-OMeTAD is the best-performing HTM for these cells in terms of efficiency, but it requires dopant additives to increase its mobility, and stability problems caused by additives in spiro-OMeTAD have resulted in consistently poor stability from record devices (Fig.  2c ). To solve or offset the negative effects of spiro-OMeTAD additives, several strategies have been used, including reducing the use of additives 163 , introducing Li +
complex agents to inhibit Li +
migration 164 , 165 , introducing substances with hydrophobic groups 166
and developing new doping regulators 167 . For example, stable organic radicals have been used as dopants along with ionic salts as doping regulators to oxidize spiro-OMeTAD and increase its hole mobility (Fig.  4h ). The efficiency of devices made using this method exceeded 25% PCE, with the
T 80
of unencapsulated devices aged at 70 °C (measured in an N 2
glovebox) increasing from ~264 h to ~796 h (ref.
168 ). Many researchers are focused on the development of additive-free HTMs, including organic small-molecule materials 93 , 169 , polymers 170
and inorganic hole-transport materials 171 . For example, PSCs using compact, conformal CuSCN as a HTL have recorded PCEs exceeding 20% and show excellent stability at 60 °C over 1,000 h (ref.
172 ). Furthermore, the efficiency of additive-free, polymer-HTL-based PSCs has exceeded 24% and maintain 80% original efficiency after ~1,000 h under 1-sun irradiation (white LED, 100 mW cm −2 , 25 °C, under N 2 ) 173 . Accelerated lifetime testing It is impractical to use decades-long protocols for stability testing. Hence, correlation between accelerated testing protocols, degradation models and real-world outdoor testing were used to establish the IEC standards used to certify Si PV panels 174 . These standards do not extend to perovskite PV as the acceleration factors used to correlate simulated and real-world testing are different 35 . Additionally, perovskite PV demonstrates behaviour unknown in Si PV related to ion migration and electrochemistry, such as performance recovery under dark conditions 175 , 176 . There are two purposes to stability testing. The first is to identify the rough operational stability of a device in comparison to a control or another study — this type of reporting is common across PSC research. The second is to identify the failure modes of devices and to develop a model for how devices degrade with time. Considering that many PSCs have been reported with little to no degradation under ISOS-L1 conditions for >1,000 h (refs.
9 , 141 , 177 ), accelerated testing and modelling of degradation modes is becoming ever more important. This concept has been used successfully in organic photovoltaics (OPV) and in Si PV where degradation is assumed to derive from a set of individual activation energies that interact multiplicatively 178 , but has seldom been used in perovskite PV. In OPV and Si PV, thermally induced decay is modelled using the Arrhenius equation, to which light intensity is simply assumed to apply multiplicatively. For example, for an arbitrary decay function with some number of constant decay rates
\(k\) , $${\rm{PCE}}\left(t\right)=f\left({k}_{1},{k}_{2},{k}_{3},\ldots ,t\right)+C$$ where each decay rate represents a different decay mode in the material (such as halide migration, cation diffusion or B-site oxidation). Traditional models use $${\rm{AF}}=\frac{{k}_{{\rm{acc}}}}{{k}_{{\rm{ref}}}}={{\rm{e}}}^{\frac{{E}_{{\rm{a}}}}{{k}_{{\rm{B}}}}\left(\frac{1}{{T}_{{\rm{ref}}}}-\frac{1}{{T}_{{\rm{acc}}}}\right)}$$ as the acceleration factor for thermal degradation, where
E a
is the activation energy for thermal degradation, and
T ref
and
T acc
are reference and elevated temperatures, respectively 178 . To include light intensity, a factor is multiplied such that $${{\rm{AF}}}_{{\rm{L+T}}}={{\rm{AF}}}_{{\rm{L}}}{{\rm{AF}}}_{{\rm{T}}}=\frac{{I}_{{\rm{acc}}}}{{I}_{{\rm{ref}}}}{{\rm{e}}}^{\frac{{E}_{{\rm{a}}}}{{k}_{{\rm{B}}}}\left(\frac{1}{{T}_{{\rm{ref}}}}-\frac{1}{{T}_{{\rm{acc}}}}\right)}$$ where
I acc
and
I ref
represent the light intensity of accelerated and reference testing, respectively. Depending on the decay mode, one might find that only some decay rates are affected by heat and others by illumination intensity 10 . For example, a simple model for N 2 -encapsulated CsPbI 3
PSCs that considers only one light intensity has been reported. The PCE of devices with and without a 2D capping layer degraded according to a biexponential relationship, with two decay rates. Interestingly, both decay rates followed the same relationship with temperature, so were both derived from the same activation energy. Fitting data to this simple model found good agreement, and the lifetime of cells operated at 35 °C could be predicted to be >5 years (Fig.  6a,b ). This result is even more impressive when considering that these cells were under constant 1-sun illumination, which is roughly 5 times the average irradiation experienced by a typical real-world panel, suggesting a similar lifetime to that of established PV technology 25 .

Full size image An interesting finding from this work is that the common fast initial decay, often classified as ‘burn-in’, could be generated by the same mechanism that causes slow long-term decay. What is still unclear, however, is why ion migration has two different decay modes and to what extent each of them is reversible. A more comprehensive model for MAPbI 3
that includes humidity, oxygen, light intensity as well as temperature has been developed 179 . In this model, the light intensity acceleration factor is ( I acc / I ref ) 0.7 , so less important than the linear multiplicative factor used for established PV, but still indicates that high light intensities could substantially speed up degradation testing. Little work has been done on accelerated testing using high light intensities, although two reports demonstrate stability up to 10-sun intensity ( T 90  ~ 150 h, Fig.  6c ) suggesting this could be a useful parameter to accelerate testing timescales 180 , 181 , 182 . Another key consideration when selecting accelerated testing scenarios is the effect of cycling ageing conditions as, in real-world use, a large discrepancy between light-cycled devices (12 h light, 12 h dark) and continuously illuminated devices will occur. For example, in one study, a light-cycled device yielded an average efficiency of 96% initial PCE across 250 h, compared with a continuously illuminated cell that averaged only 88% initial efficiency (Fig.  6d ). In the same study, temperature-cycled devices (65 °C to −10 °C every 2 h) degraded at a rate in between devices held at either −10 °C or 65 °C (ref.
175 ). Monitoring the performance of a device subjected to simulated weather conditions from two days of each month in the year resulted in several interesting observations. Over the course of each day, the PSC degraded substantially relative to what was expected from single MPP measurements at each light intensity and temperature. Initially, the degradation was reversible and the device completely recovered by the second day, but the proportion of reversible decay reduced over time, and after the first week most degradation was irreversible. Exposure to high light intensities seemed to dominate PSC degradation rather than high temperatures. Understanding what causes reversible and irreversible change to PCE is a pertinent question for future testing. Even this small pool of results suggests that many different testing conditions need to be applied, modelled and compared to build up a reliable testing protocol. Testing with multiple stressors at once is essential to obtain reliable results. For example, in one study, encapsulated Cs 0.05 FA 0.8 MA 0.15 Pb(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3
cells showed no degradation after 2,000 h of IEC standard damp-heat testing. When subjected to MPP tracking under illumination, however, the same cells degraded to 80% of their initial PCE in a few tens of hours under illumination at an elevated temperature (45 °C) 183 . To combat this discrepancy, researchers should compare different ageing conditions individually and in combination. First, researchers should find an encapsulation technique that can allow cells to pass the IEC61215:2016 damp-heat test (85 °C/85% relative humidity), and then operational testing under different light and temperature conditions should be examined. These conditions should include varying light intensity (0.1 to 10 suns, with and without ultraviolet light), temperature cycling (−40 °C to 85 °C) and light cycling (0 to 1 sun). Perspective and conclusion For many years now, stability rather than efficiency has been the most pressing issue in PSC research. In this time, great progress has been made, and the field has produced a toolbox with which we can fabricate highly stable PSCs. Indeed, it should come as no surprise that the strongest operational stability yet reported (ref.
10 ) used PSCs that are all-inorganic (high-temperature stability), have Cr/Au electrodes, and use 2D perovskite and Al 2 O 3
barrier layers. Clearly the field is advancing, and by using many stability-enhancing techniques in parallel, multiyear operational stability has been achieved. A few final pieces are needed to demonstrate long-term stability: accurate models that allow faster accelerated ageing on a wider range of PSCs, methods to increase predicted
T 80
stability to >25 years and techniques to upscale stable methods for large-area modules. Here, we give our view on how best to approach these challenges. Modelling degradation In theory, one can accurately model the degradation from multiple stressors and degradation modes by patiently examining stability curves and fitting them to increasingly complex functions. Instead, it is easier to work on a PSC architecture that is already reasonably robust, which reduces the number of potential degradation modes and simplifies the model. Encapsulating cells in multiple layers and/or using glass–glass lamination seems to negate environmental effects. Then, by using stable transport layers and conformal blocking layers, we can focus on the perovskite film. Limiting temperatures to <90 °C for FA-based perovskites and to <300 °C for inorganic perovskites can restrict unrealistic thermal decomposition. Previous testing suggests that only a few degradation modes are present after such isolation: ion drift, decomposition of PbI to Pb 0
and I 2
gas, cation segregation and halide segregation. Although still a complex system, these processes are governed by ion migration energies and light-induced decomposition, so only a small number of measurements are required. We expect sophisticated models that capture this behaviour to appear soon. Once established, they can be used to accelerate testing protocols further, using high illumination intensities and high temperatures. Methods to increase perovskite stability Although impressive increases to PSC stability have been achieved, these results do not yet meet the requirements for commercial application. To further increase stability, additional techniques should be considered in combination with other strategies. We suggest some underappreciated methods below. Single-crystal PSCs Single-crystal perovskites are archetypal materials for investigation as they have no grain boundaries and have defect densities several orders of magnitude lower than their polycrystalline counterparts 184 , 185 , 186 . As such, single crystals demonstrate suppressed ion migration, charge accumulation and defect-induced phase transitions 187 . The relatively small number of reports on single-crystal PSCs have shown that single crystals are superior to polycrystalline films at withstanding humidity and heat 188 . Through modified HTL–perovskite interface, MAPbI 3
single-crystal devices with 22.1% PCE have been achieved. These devices maintained 90% of their initial PCE after 1,000 h in air, compared with controls maintaining only 61% 189 . Given their inherent advantages, we expect single-crystal PSCs to display impressive stability under operation, but more work is necessary to conclude on the matter. Quasi-single-crystalline PSCs We currently lack methods to upscale single-crystal PSCs, and cell areas are limited to ~0.1 cm 2 . Quasi-single-crystal film growth (that is, the growth of films composed of micrometre-scale single crystallites through seeded growth) represents a promising middle ground between traditional thin-film processing and single-crystal PSCs. For example, perovskite thin films have been fabricated by first forming a repeating array of 5-µm crystals spaced 5 µm apart, seeding the growth of a continuous film with grain size exceeding 3 µm (ref.
190 ). Stability tracking of encapsulated devices (FTO/SnO 2 /perovskite/PEAI/spiro-OMeTAD/Au, where FTO is fluorine-doped tin oxide) at room temperature under AM1.5 1-sun intensity (ISOS-L1) demonstrated a
T 80
lifetime of 200 h for control devices and a
T 90
of 2,000 h for the seeded growth films (initial PCE ~24%). Optimized PSC architecture could further improve the stability of quasi-single-crystal devices. Down-conversion layer Because shorter-wavelength light is the most detrimental to perovskite stability, introducing a barrier layer to absorb ultraviolet light is an obvious way to enhance PSC stability. However, this approach also reduces the short-circuit current density
J SC
(ref.
56 ). Using a down-conversion material as a barrier layer solves this issue by absorbing ultraviolet light and converting it into longer (visible) wavelengths. Although this concept has attracted some attention 62 , it has mostly been applied to non-optimized MAPbI 3
cells in an attempt to increase the current density, rather than to achieve higher stability. Conversion layers with photoluminescent quantum efficiency >80% induce only about a 2% increase in
J SC , and this small improvement in current probably does not justify the added cost of the additional layers. These down-conversion layers, however, could be integrated in cells to improve their stability. For example, MAPbI 3
cells using a CsPbCl 3 :Mn quantum dot conversion layer yielded a fourfold increase in stability under ultraviolet light 191 . The use of this method in a highly stable cell architecture is an exciting prospect. Upscaling stability Most of the methods described herein were demonstrated on cells with <1 cm 2
active area. Upscaling this to modules involves a change in approach, moving away from spin coating to techniques such as blade coating, slot-die coating, screen printing or vacuum evaporation. These processes have a whole host of new engineering challenges to produce PCEs and stabilities comparable with small-scale, spin-coated devices. For solution-processed films, volatile solvents such as DMSO are usually used, but unevaporated trapped DMSO can escape to produce voids between the perovskite and CTLs. This issue is accentuated in large-area devices causing rapid degradation under light and heat. Using non-volatile carbohydrazide to replace DMSO can overcome this issue. Carbohydrazide is reported to remain in films even after long-term exposure to 1-sun illumination at 60 °C, and 50-cm 2
modules using carbohydrazine have been fabricated 192
with efficiencies approaching 20% PCE and
T 85
lifetimes of 1,000 h under 1-sun illumination at 50 °C. Even more encouraging is the report of a
T 97  > 1 year for 20-cm 2
devices under light cycling, produced by replacing DMSO with another less volatile agent (diphenyl sulfoxide) 193 . In monolithically integrated panels, P2 laser scribing can leave thermally damaged perovskite near the edges of the scribe. Furthermore, if metal is used to fill the via (the trench created in the scribing process), the direct contact with the perovskite can cause rapid degradation because halides react with metal 194 . Making singulated cells is advantageous to avoid the use of laser scribes. This approach keeps barriers intact, avoids passing metal through the perovskite, avoids thermal damage associated with laser scribing, and allows the binning of cells by efficiency. If singulated cells are connected with a wire, current can be routed around a cell and through a bypass diode to prevent the cell from being pushed into reverse bias if it is in the shade while the other cells are illuminated. Perovskite–silicon tandems naturally take this approach. These promising results suggest that highly stable modules are achievable. We expect a continued focus on module stability as the field progresses towards commercial stability. Conclusion Despite being a persistent problem in perovskite PV, stability has improved by orders of magnitude in the first decade of mainstream perovskite PV research. With the introduction of various stability-enhancing methods, the operational stability of PSCs is maturing beyond practically achievable testing lifetimes. The introduction of degradation modelling and lifetime estimation has suggested that some current PSC configurations could already have lifetimes similar to established PV. Currently, PSC researchers are using the ISOS protocols adapted from OPV research. Further degradation analysis and comparison with outdoor testing is critical to generate perovskite-specific protocols for calculating cell lifetimes and to understand how to improve stability further. Because many factors cause PSC degradation, solving stability issues using only one method is unrealistic, and the synergistic use of various stability-enhancing methods is the way forward. Considering what has already been achieved and the continued huge effort expended in this field, we expect that perovskite solar modules that retain 90% of their initial performance after 25 years of operation will soon emerge.

Abstract The area of thin-film photovoltaics has been overwhelmed by organometal halide perovskites. Unfortunately, serious stability concerns arise with perovskite solar cells. For example, methyl-ammonium lead iodide is known to decompose in the presence of water and, more severely, even under inert conditions at elevated temperatures. Here, we demonstrate inverted perovskite solar cells, in which the decomposition of the perovskite is significantly mitigated even at elevated temperatures. Specifically, we introduce a bilayered electron-extraction interlayer consisting of aluminium-doped zinc oxide and tin oxide. We evidence tin oxide grown by atomic layer deposition does form an outstandingly dense gas permeation barrier that effectively hinders the ingress of moisture towards the perovskite and—more importantly—it prevents the egress of decomposition products of the perovskite. Thereby, the overall decomposition of the perovskite is significantly suppressed, leading to an outstanding device stability.

Introduction Solar cells based on organolead halide perovskites have seen tremendous progress over the past 5 years 1 . Although their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has skyrocketed to reach a level of >20% (ref.
2 ), concerns about their stability are still intimately linked to this technology 3 , 4 , 5 . Generally, there is consensus that perovskites like CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
decompose to their constituents, that is, HI, CH 3 NH 2
and PbI 2 , in the presence of water 6 . Moreover, the intrinsic decomposition of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
to CH 3 NH 3 I and PbI 2 , which is thermally activated and which occurs even under inert conditions, states a more fundamental problem 7 , 8 . At the same time, there are secondary effects of perovskite decomposition such as the degradation of functional building blocks in the solar cell because of the corrosive effect of the perovskite decomposition products 9 . Specifically, the corrosion of metal electrodes like Ag or Al has been identified to be a critical issue 10 . Overall, without proper concepts to overcome these reliability issues, the prospects of wide-spread application and commercialization of organolead halide perovskite technology may be significantly compromised. Among the various device architectures for perovskite solar cells, the inverted planar geometry has been shown to yield devices essentially free of hysteresis 11 , 12 . Here, the photogenerated holes are extracted via the bottom electrode using a hole-extraction interlayer (for example, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)), while the electron extraction proceeds via the top electrode. The energetic alignment of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
and [6,6′]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) has been shown to be especially favourable for the extraction of electrons from the conduction band of the perovskite 13 . To overcome the stability issues discussed above, several groups have introduced inverted planar perovskite cells based on metal oxides as electron- and hole-extraction interfacial layers adjacent to the cathode and anode, respectively 14 , 15 . Chen
et al . 15
employed a sol-gel Ti(Nb)O x
electron-extraction layer that was aimed to protect the perovskite against moisture from ambient atmosphere. Because of its poor electrical conductivity of 10 −5  S cm –1 , the authors had to limit the thickness of the sol-gel Ti(Nb)O x
to 10 nm. Moreover, it is known that sol-gel-derived layers state only relatively poor permeation barriers 16 . As a result, the device stability tests that afforded a lifetime of 1,000 h were done with additional encapsulation. Kaltenbrunner
et al . 17
have used Cr 2 O 3 /Cr at the cathode side to protect the metal cathode and thereby to improve the stability under ambient conditions, but still the efficiency was found to drop to 80% of its initial value after only 28 h. Very recently, Guerrero
et al . 18
confirmed the protective effect of the Cr 2 O 3 /Cr interlayer but still found some severe degradation after only a few hours. You
et al . 14
have shown that devices based on indium tin oxide (ITO)/NiO/perovskite/ZnO/Al were stable for tens of days in ambient conditions, whereas a reference device based on ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM/Al showed severe degradation within half a day. Especially, the ZnO layer, which has been spin coated from a nanoparticle dispersion on top of the perovskite, has been claimed to protect the Al electrode against corrosion. Very recently, Bush
et al . 19
have found that in their devices a similar nanoparticle-based ZnO layer next to the cathode did not provide any sufficient protection at elevated temperatures. As solar cells in outdoor conditions may reach a temperature significantly above 25 °C, the latter result appears to be extremely relevant. Other reports have evidenced rapid decomposition of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
when in direct contact with ZnO 20 . Here we propose an inverted cell architecture, where a bilayered aluminium-doped ZnO (AZO)/tin oxide (SnO x ) electron-extraction layer (EEL) affords perovskite solar cells with a remarkable resilience against moisture and heat. AZO is excellently suited to extract electrons from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of fullerenes 21 . However, the nanoparticle-based AZO layer does not provide sufficient protection against the ingress of moisture or the egress of perovskite decomposition products. Thus, we add a thin SnO x
layer to form a bilayered AZO/SnO x
EEL assembly. The SnO x
is grown by low-temperature atomic layer deposition (ALD) at 80 °C that affords extremely dense, conformal and pinhole-free layers. Please note that there are reports where ALD layers have been directly deposited on top of perovskites to improve their resilience against ambient atmosphere and heat 22 . However, these ALD layers were not a functional part of a device, and therefore most of the experiments were based on electrical insulators like Al 2 O 3 . SnO x
layers grown by ALD are optically highly transparent, electrically conductive and provide outstanding gas permeation barrier properties with a water vapour transmission rate as low as 7 × 10 −5  g (m −2  day −1 ), even when grown at a low temperature 23 . Their water vapour transmission rate is orders of magnitude better than that of sputtered ITO thin films or that of solution processed metal oxide layers. The electrical conductivity of the SnO x
layer on the order of 5 × 10 −3  S cm −1
allows us to place it between the sensitive electrode and the photoactive layers without adding any noticeable series resistance. Thereby, the SnO x
provides outstanding protection of the perovskite against the ingress of moisture and, more importantly, at the same time it serves as permeation barrier against the out-diffusion of decomposition products of the perovskite. We will show that the sealing property of the SnO x
layer contains the decomposition products inside the cell and, thereby, the overall decomposition of the perovskite is significantly suppressed. Although cells based on LiF/Al or AZO degrade within tens of hours in ambient air (23 °C and 50% relative humidity (rH)), devices based on AZO/SnO x
show superior stability of their solar cell characteristics even on a timescale of >350 h. More strikingly, at 60 °C under inert atmosphere, AZO-based devices degrade within 100 h because of thermally induced decomposition of the perovskite. On the contrary, the suppressed out-diffusion of decomposition products because of the diffusion-barrier properties of the AZO/SnO x
EEL affords cells that are essentially unchanged even after >1,000 h under the same conditions. Our paper reports a general strategy to achieve a substantially improved device lifetime in the case of photoactive materials that may come with concerns about their intrinsic compositional stability. Results Planar inverted cells The devices used in this study are based on a planar inverted cell layout, where the holes are extracted via the bottom electrode (substrate electrode). The layer sequence is shown in
Fig. 1 . As hole-extraction layer, PEDOT:PSS is used, whereas for electron extraction a 100 nm thick PCBM layer is deposited on top of the typically 180 nm thick CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
perovskite layer. Directly adjacent to the PCBM we have used a 100 nm thick AZO layer prepared from a nanoparticle dispersion in isopropylalcohol. In some cells, a SnO x
layer is deposited on top of the AZO layer by ALD at 80 °C to form the bilayered electron-extraction assembly (AZO/SnO x ). The nominal thickness of the SnO x
layer is 20 nm. As the AZO layer is derived from a nanoparticle dispersion, it contains pores that are partially coated with SnO x
because of the conformal nature of the ALD process. A more detailed discussion of the SnO x
growth on top of the AZO layer is provided in the
Supplementary Fig. 1 . Please note that we have also prepared devices with SnO x
deposited directly on top of PCBM, but the stability of the resulting devices was inferior to that of the AZO/SnO x
cells (see discussion below). Reference devices based on ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Perovskite/PCBM/LiF/Al have also been included in our study. Figure 1: Basic device characteristics. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the device cross-section along with the assignment of the respective layers ( a ). In some devices, the SnO x
or the AZO layer has been omitted. Note that the contrast between the AZO and the SnO x
layers in SEM is relatively poor. External quantum efficiency (EQE) of a representative device based on AZO/SnO x

Fig. 1b . The
J/V
characteristics of the device measured in forward and reverse direction (scan speed: 500 mV s −1 ) are presented in
Fig. 1c . No substantial hysteresis is found in the
J/V
data. The extracted characteristics
V oc =0.95 V, FF=74% and a
J sc =18 mA cm −2
result in a PCE of 12.8%. We want to note that the perovskite precursor used in this study was commercially obtained from Ossila Ltd with a typically specified efficiency in the range of 11–13% (see Methods for details). Significantly higher PCEs can be achieved by using, for example, optimized precursor inks or mixed-cation/mixed-halide perovskite absorbers 24 . As the EEL is in the core of this report, further optimization of the perovskite system itself was considered to be beyond the scope here. Stability in ambient air A very striking advantage of the bilayered AZO/SnO x
EEL in direct comparison with AZO is displayed in
Fig. 2 . Here, the stability of the cell characteristics is shown for devices that were continuously exposed to ambient air at 23 °C and 50% relative humidity. The devices that were based on a single layer of AZO as EEL degrade swiftly within
∼ 50 h. A severe decay of the FF from
∼ 70% to <25% and a concomitant drop of the
J sc
from
∼ 17 to 8.2 mA cm −2
is found. Opposed to that, the characteristics of the corresponding cells with the bilayered EEL of AZO/SnO x
do not show any degradation even after >300 h in air. Note that the thickness of the SnO x
layer is only 20 nm in these devices. There is a slight increase of the
V oc
in the AZO/SnO x
samples that happens on a timescale of several tens of hours. This increase is only observed in the AZO/SnO x
samples, as the LiF/Al and the AZO cells already undergo strong degradation on the same timescale. A similar increase of
V oc
on such a long timescale has been seen by other authors and it has been explained by an ageing effect that reduces the density of trap states in the perovskite 25 . As a reference, the cells based on LiF/Al are essentially degraded within
∼ 1 day. Figure 2: Stability upon storage in ambient air. Characteristics of inverted perovskite collar cells with varied cathode/electron extraction assemblies (AZO/SnO x /Ag, AZO/Ag and LiF/Al) versus time of storage in ambient air (at 23 °C and 50% rH).

measurements in reverse direction (examples in
Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Full size image In order to analyse the reasons underlying the strikingly different degradation phenomena shown in
Fig. 2 , we have performed X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies of the respective device structures. Note that in case of the XPS measurements, a thinner top Ag electrode was chosen (10 nm) compared with the actual solar cells (100 nm) because of the small probing depth of the technique. Looking first at the AZO-based device, the XRD spectrum shows the (110) and (220) reflections of tetragonal MAPbI 3
at angles of 14.11° and 28.14, respectively. As this XRD measurement has been made on a full device stack, further signals related to the Ag and ITO electrodes are visible. A detailed assignment of these peaks is shown in the
Supplementary Fig. 3 . Only a very weak signal due to PbI 2
was found that did not significantly increase even after 7 days in air ( Fig. 3a ). Thus, no severe decomposition of the perovskite to PbI 2
upon storage in air can be inferred from the XRD data. On the other hand, when XPS was used to look for degradation products on the surface, a notable amount of iodine was evidenced on the AZO sample ( Fig. 3b ) after exposure to air for 2 days, whereas on identical samples kept in nitrogen no such iodine signal is found. Please note that the peak of
∼ 622 eV in the XPS spectrum of the aged AZO cell does not represent another bonding state of the iodine, but it is rather a so-called shake-up peak. Such shake-up peaks are commonly observed in strong XPS signals. The survey XPS spectra can be found in the
Supplementary Fig. 4 . Plan-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the AZO samples aged in air show the formation of spot-like degradation motifs ( Fig. 3c,d ). These spots point to the local ingress of moisture and out-diffusion of decomposition products of the perovskite, supported by the appearance of the iodine signal in XPS. In the degraded spots, needle-like features occur. Similar features have been reported for Ag electrodes corroded by the decomposition products of MAPbI 3
(ref.
26 ). Our findings are also in line with the results of Kato
et al . 10
who unveiled a moisture promoted corrosion mechanism of Ag which resulted in the formation of products like AgI. The role of water in the electrode corrosion is further clarified below in cells aged under inert conditions. Figure 3: Unravelling the ageing mechanism in air. XRD spectrum of a perovskite cell based on AZO as EEL after storage in air for 7 days (inset: magnified view of the (100) PbI 2

sample ( e ). Schemes of ageing for the AZO and the AZO/SnO x
samples ( f , g ). Full size image To explain the spot-like degradation, we can assume that structural defects, such as pinholes, in the AZO NP layer would give rise to locally enhanced water permeation. Opposed to that, the sample with the bilayered EEL of AZO/SnO x
does not show any sign of degradation in SEM ( Fig. 3e ) under identical conditions. In XPS, only a negligible amount of iodine at the surface of the AZO/SnO x
samples can be detected. For comparison, we have also studied layer stacks where only SnO x , that is, without AZO between the PCBM and the SnO x , has been used as EEL. We have recently shown that SnO x
with a work function of 4.1 eV forms an excellent EEL layer in inverted organic solar cells 27 . Here, the resulting perovskite solar cells based on SnO x
were more stable than the devices based on AZO. However, they showed a statistical failure on a timescale of 100 h ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ). This finding could be explained by a nonideal ALD growth of the SnO x
directly on top of the organic PCBM layer. ALD as a chemical deposition technique relies on self-limiting chemical reactions on the sample surface 28 . For the ALD deposition of oxide layers, –OH surface groups form the nucleation sites for layer growth. In this sense, on organic surfaces like PCBM the nucleation of an ALD layer may deviate significantly from the growth on a surface rich of –OH groups 29 . Therefore, we can assume that the SnO x
layer grown on PCBM is not free of some pin-hole defects that compromise its functionality as diffusion barrier. Consequently, substantially more iodine is detected on the surface after exposure to air compared with the AZO/SnO x
device ( Fig. 3b ). Thus, we conclude that the AZO serves two purposes in the bilayered AZO/SnO x
EEL: (1) its electronic structure has been shown to facilitate electron extraction from the PCBM (ref.
21 ) and (2) the AZO layer provides an improved (oxide-) surface for the nucleation of the subsequent SnO x
ALD layer that can thus from a dense, pin-hole-free permeation barrier.
Figure 3f,g
shows schemes portraying the specific differences between AZO and AZO/SnO x
as EEL in devices exposed to air. As indicated before, the AZO layer prepared from the NP dispersion does not provide a significant diffusion barrier against the local ingress of moisture from the ambient air. As a result, decomposition of the MAPbI 3
perovskite occurs and yields iodine-based products that migrate to the surface. In the case of AZO/SnO x , substantially better moisture barrier properties prevent the penetration of water. The claim of superior moisture barrier properties of the bilayered AZO/SnO x
EEL compared with that of the AZO NP layer is also supported by Ca-corrosion tests ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ). It has to be noted that the detrimental effects of ambient air could in principle be avoided by using a proper encapsulation of the entire solar cell. However, the out-diffusion of decomposition products from the perovskite and the degradation of the metal electrode ( Fig. 3c,d ) may impose a more fundamental issue. This is even more important, as earlier reports evidenced the thermally activated decomposition of the MAPbI 3
perovskite even under inert atmosphere 7 . Stability at elevated temperatures To study the long-term stability of our solar cells under inert conditions, we have stored a set of devices in a glove box under N 2
atmosphere. All the devices were placed on a hot plate at 60 °C and their characteristics were measured repeatedly. Most remarkably, the characteristics of devices based on AZO EELs degraded on a timescale of 100 h ( Fig. 4 ). Although the
J sc
and
V oc
of these devices remain fairly stable, the decay of the FF results in the severe drop of PCE to
∼ 2% after 360 h. The degradation motif in the AZO-based cells is essentially different from that found in ambient air, where all cell characteristics decayed within a day ( Fig. 2 ). Again in striking contrast, the characteristics of devices based on the bilayered AZO/SnO x
EEL remain almost unchanged even after 1,032 h. Note that the hysteresis did not increase in the course of ageing. Figure 4: Stability upon storage at 60 °C in nitrogen atmosphere.

( b ), FF ( c ) and PCE ( d ). In this set of samples, the nominal thickness of the ALD SnO x
layer was 20 nm and that of the Ag electrode was 100 nm. The characteristics have been determined from the
J/V
measurements in reverse direction ( Supplementary Fig. 7 ). Full size image To unravel the mechanisms behind these results, we have again performed XRD and XPS studies of the respective device structures. After heating the device stacks for 6 days under inert atmosphere, the XRD spectrum of the AZO samples reveals a significant signal due to PbI 2
that is absent in pristine stacks ( Fig. 5a ). The formation of PbI 2
indicates the thermally activated decomposition of the perovskite upon heating, in agreement with earlier reports 7 . Opposed to that, the devices based on the bilayered AZO/SnO x
EEL do not show any signature of a PbI 2
phase after identical ageing conditions ( Fig. 5b ). Figure 5: Why impermeable AZO/SnO x
EELs afford stable devices. XRD spectra of a perovskite cell based on AZO and AZO/SnO x

Note that the top Ag electrode was chosen to be 10 nm. Corresponding plan-view SEM image of the 10 nm Ag layer in case of the aged AZO sample. ( d ) Schemes of ageing and decomposition of the perovskite in case of the AZO ( e ) and the AZO/SnO x
samples ( f ). The yellow spot in the scheme of the AZO sample symbolizes the formation of PbI 2 . Full size image The formation of PbI 2
in the AZO samples is in contrast to the degradation experiments in air, where no PbI 2
phase in the AZO samples was found in XRD ( Fig. 3a ). At the same time, the I3d 5/2
XPS spectra ( Fig. 5c ) do not reveal any significant increase of the amount of iodine at the surface of any of the samples aged in N 2 . Please note that the noise in the XPS spectra indicates that the concentration of I3d 5/2
at the surface of all the samples is close to the detection limit and variations between the samples are within the measurement error. A plan-view SEM image of the aged AZO samples does not reveal any degradation of the Ag electrode, in contrast to the experiment where the ageing took place in air ( Fig. 3c,d ). Thus, we conclude that in the case of AZO, volatile decomposition products of the MAPbI 3
perovskite evaporate from the cell stack without degradation of the Ag electrode. In air, other than in N 2 , the presence of water would promote the corrosion of Ag because of CH 3 NH 3 I and other halide compounds 10 . However, the loss of CH 3 NH 3 I etc. drives the further decomposition of the perovskite. Discussion Taken together, the device characteristics ( Fig. 4 ) and the XRD and XPS spectroscopy point to a scheme of degradation as shown in
Fig. 5e,f . Under inert atmosphere, the thermally activated degradation of the perovskite leads to decomposition products that can easily diffuse through the PCBM/AZO/Ag layers on top of the perovskite. The less volatile PbI 2
phase remains in the active layer leading to a substantial decay of the FF of the corresponding devices ( Fig. 4c ). Moreover, it has been shown earlier that a change in film stoichiometry (Pb poor to Pb rich) may substantially alter the electronic properties of the perovskite and especially the position of the conduction and valence band with respect to the vacuum level 30 . Towards increasingly Pb-rich conditions, the ionization energy of the perovskite has been shown to increase significantly to values in excess of 6 eV that would render the extraction of holes more and more challenging. Opposed to the case of the AZO cells, the AZO/SnO x -based cells do not show any formation of PbI 2
under otherwise identical conditions. We therefore conclude that the decomposition products are contained inside the cell stack because of the dense SnO x
layer forming a permeation barrier. Thereby, the equilibrium of the decomposition/formation reaction would be shifted to stabilize the perovskite. Thus, the decomposition of the MAPbI 3
obviously is significantly slowed down, and the cells do not show significant degradation even after heating for >1,000 h ( Fig. 4 ). It has to be noted that it is favourable to position the permeation barrier between the perovskite and the Ag electrode, as thereby the known long-term corrosive effect of residual halide components on the Ag electrode 31
and on the interface EEL/Ag can be efficiently suppressed. In further work, this concept could even be extended to a setup, in which the perovskite layer is sandwiched between diffusion barriers at the cathode and anode side, in case permeable substrates like polymer foils are used. For example, there are reports on using ALD to prepare V 2 O 5
layers 32 . V 2 O 5
is a high work function transition metal oxide that has successfully been used for hole extraction in organic and perovskite solar cells 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 . ALD prepared V 2 O 5
would presumably provide similar gas permeation barrier properties as those shown for the SnO x . Thereby, the intrinsic decomposition of the perovskite active layers would be substantially delayed or even prevented as volatile decomposition products would be hindered from evaporating. Aside from the so-called mono-stress conditions like elevated temperature, multi-stressing can be considered. To this end, we conducted set of long-term light soaking tests at 60 °C under N 2 , in which the devices were simultaneously illuminated with a white light-emitting diode (LED) to achieve the same
J sc
as upon AM1.5G solar irradiation (for details see the Methods section). The results of this multi-stress experiment are shown in the
Supplementary Fig. 8 . Briefly, again the AZO/SnO x
cells are substantially more stable than the AZO cells under concomitant heat and illumination. This difference is in part because of the suppressed decomposition of the perovskite owing to heat in case of the AZO/SnO x
(in agreement with the discussion of
Fig. 4 ). However, there is a clear degradation even of the AZO/SnO x
samples where the PCE decays to roughly 60% of its initial value after 300 h. This is in contrast to the case where only thermal stress has been used. Earlier work has unravelled the photo-induced degradation of solar cells based on MAPbI 3 . Whereas Misra
et al . 37
identified a photoactivated decomposition mechanism, more recently Nie
et al . 38
reported that continuous illumination of MAPbI 3
caused the formation of trap states that spoiled the solar cell performance, especially
J sc . Although our sealing approach based on the impermeable AZO/SnO x
electron extraction layer has been shown to efficiently suppress the decomposition of the perovskite, it cannot suppress the formation of trap states in the perovskite. Similar to the report of Nie
et al . 38
the cell characteristics recover after stressing, if the cells are kept in darkness ( Supplementary Fig. 8f ). This is why we conclude that photo-induced trap-state formation occurs in our cells. However, there have been recent reports confirming that photo-induced degradation is not a general problem of organolead halide perovskites, and some optimized mixed cation/mixed halide perovskite active materials were shown to be far less prone to light soaking degradation 24 , 39 . Heat was found to be a dominating source of degradation in these mixed cation perovskite cells 40 . Note that our inverted device structure based on the impermeable AZO/SnO x
electron extraction layer is generally applicable and can also accommodate these next-generation perovskite photoactive systems with enhanced stability and efficiency 41 . In summary, we have shown an ultra-stable inverted cell architecture, where a bilayered AZO/SnO x
EEL has been demonstrated to afford perovskite solar cells with a remarkable resilience. The 20 nm thin ALD grown SnO x
has been evidenced to form an outstandingly dense gas permeation barrier that effectively hinders the ingress of moisture towards the perovskite and—more importantly—it prevents the egress of decomposition products like CH 3 NH 3 I, HI out of the perovskite. Although the efficiency of cells based on LiF/Al or AZO degraded to <50% of the initial value within less than a day in ambient air, devices based on AZO/SnO x
showed superior stability of their solar cell characteristics even on a timescale of >350 h. Under inert atmosphere, AZO-based devices degraded to roughly 50% of its initial efficiency within 100 h because of thermally induced decomposition of the perovskite. On the contrary, the suppressed out-diffusion of decomposition products because of the diffusion-barrier properties of the AZO/SnO x
EEL has been shown to significantly slow down the thermally activated decomposition of the perovskite. This afforded cells that did not change even after >1,000 h. The concept of impermeable EELs is generally applicable and therefore is expected to provide an avenue to achieve a substantially improved device lifetime of solar cells based on organometal halide perovskites even beyond MAPbI 3 . Methods Material synthesis and device preparation The inverted perovskite solar cells studied in this work are based on the following layer sequence: glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM/EEL/Ag (see
Fig. 1a ). The PEDOT layer (AI4083) has been spin coated in ambient air and dried on a hot plate at 120 °C for 20 min in air and for another 20 min in a glove box under N 2
atmosphere. The perovskite layer has been spin coated under inert atmosphere from a commercially available precursor solution (Ossila) and the resulting layers were thermally annealed at 100 °C for 80 min. The typical layer thickness was 180 nm. On top of the perovskite, PCBM (American Dye Sorce Inc., ADS61BFA) was spin coated from a solution in chlorobenzene (concentration: 100 mg ml −1 ). AZO has been deposited from a commercial nanoparticle dispersion (2.5 wt% in isopropanol, Prod. No. 8045, Nanograde AG, Switzerland). Tin oxide has been prepared by atomic layer deposition in a Beneq TFS 200 system (base pressure 1.5 mbar). As precursors, tetrakis(dimethylamino)tin(IV) (TDMASn), kept at 45 °C and water, kept at room temperature, were used. At a substrate temperature of 80 °C the growth rate per cycle was 1.1 Å. Further details on the materials properties of the SnO x
can be found in our earlier work 23 , 27 . Ag (100 or 10 nm) layers were thermally evaporated in high vacuum (10 −7  mbar). In some reference devices, LiF (1 nm) and Al (100 nm) have been thermally evaporated as cathode. Materials and device characterization The electrical conductivity was measured with the Van der Pauw method. The SEM studies were conducted using Neon 40 (Zeiss). XRD was measured using a monochromatic Cu-Kα 1,2
source (Philips X’Pert Pro MPD). XPS has been performed using a non-monochromatic Mg K α
X-ray source (VG) and a Phoibos 100 (Specs) electron analyser. Rutherford backscattering was measured at RUBION (University of Bochum, Germany) using a dynamitron tandem accelerator with 2 MeV
4 He +
beam (beam current of 20–40 nA). A silicon surface barrier detector was placed at an angle of 160° with respect to the beam axis. The solid angle of the detector was 1.91 msrad. The solar cells were characterized in ambient air without encapsulation using a Keithley 2400-C source meter and a solar simulator (300 W Newport, model 91160, AM1.5G, 100 mW cm −2 ). We used a commercial Si reference cell (Rera Systems) that is IEC 60904–9 compliant and certified. Short circuit current was obtained from the EQE data. EQE has been measured with a home-built tunable light source, calibrated with a power meter (Thorlabs). The spectral mismatch factor was 1.163. Some of the devices have been kept in a glovebox under N 2
atmosphere on a hot plate at 60 °C. The
J/V
characteristics were measured in forward and reverse direction at a scanning speed of 500 mV s −1 . Cells were measured using a mask with round aperture of 1.5 mm diameter. Stabilized current was measured in the same
J/V
setup using a voltage source. Long-term light soaking tests at 60 °C under N 2
were conducted by simultaneously illuminating the cells with a white LED to achieve the same
J sc
as upon AM1.5G solar irradiation. The LED spectrum is shown in the
Supplementary Fig. 8e . The cells were mounted in a home-built oven inside a glove box. They were kept in short circuit conditions during the ageing experiment.

Abstract Power conversion efficiencies of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on methylammonium- and bromide-free formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI 3 ) perovskites still lag behind PSCs with a regular configuration. Here we improve the quality of both the bulk and surface of FA 0.98 Cs 0.02 PbI 3
perovskite films to reduce the efficiency gap. First, we use dibutyl sulfoxide, a Lewis base additive, to improve the crystallinity and reduce the defect density and internal residual stress of the perovskite bulk. Then, we treat the surface of the perovskite film with trifluorocarbon-modified phenethylammonium iodide to optimize the energy levels, passivate defects and protect the film against moisture. The inverted PSCs simultaneously achieve 25.1% efficiency (24.5% from the reverse current–voltage scan measured by a third-party institution) and improved stability. The devices maintained 97.4% and 98.2% of their initial power conversion efficiencies after operating under continuous 1-sun air mass 1.5 G illumination for 1,800 h and under damp heat conditions (85 °C and 85% relative humidity) for 1,000 h, respectively.

Main The certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with the regular (n-i-p) structure has reached 25.7% (ref.
1 ), approaching that of the mature mono-crystalline silicon solar cells. The regular PSCs with high certified efficiencies of >25% are mainly based on organic hole transport material such as doped 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[ N , N -bis( p -methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 . However, commonly used spiro-OMeTAD with lithium salt dopants could raise additional stability issues of PSCs beyond perovskite absorbers themselves 7 , 8 . Meanwhile, inverted (p-i-n) structure PSCs based on dopant-free interfacial materials such as p-type NiO, poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine], n-type [6,6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and C 60
tend to present better stability than the regular devices under the same conditions 9 , 10 . However, up to now, inverted PSCs with efficiencies of >24% have rarely been reported 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 . Therefore, it is particularly urgent to improve the efficiency of inverted PSCs at the current stage. Screening the performance optimization strategies reported for high-efficiency (>25%) regular PSCs 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6
reveals that methylammonium (MA + )- and bromide (Br − )-free formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI 3 )-based perovskites are commonly employed because of their ideal bandgap close to the Shockley–Queisser optimum. The resultant devices typically simultaneously demonstrate high short-circuit current density ( J SC ) of ~26 mA cm –2 , and high open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 1.17–1.19 V (Supplementary Table
1 ). The high-efficiency (>24%) inverted PSCs 11 , 12 , 13 , 14
usually incorporated FAPbI 3
as the main component with small amounts of MA +
and Br −
as additives, which may be beneficial for achieving higher
V OC , but also lead to a slight sacrifice of
J SC
(Supplementary Table
1 ) due to the optical loss caused by blue-shifted absorbance. Li et al. recently reported a certified efficiency of 24.3% for inverted PSCs based on (FA 0.98 MA 0.02 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.98 Br 0.02 ) 3
perovskite 12 ; Jiang et al. used a reactive surface engineering approach based on Rb 0.05 Cs 0.05 MA 0.05 FA 0.85 Pb(I 0.95 Br 0.05 ) 3 , with the resulting p-i-n PSCs obtaining a PCE over 25% (ref.
14 ); a similar device based on pure FAPbI 3
perovskite delivered a PCE of only 22.6% with a lower
V OC
of 1.095 V. In addition, the introduction of MA +
and Br −
to FAPbI 3
could raise risk to induce problems such as low thermal stability caused by the existence of MA, phase separation caused by the presence of mixed halides, and reduced photon absorption and current density cause by Br −
incorporation 15 , 16 , 17 . Although some recent literature reported controversal results that the incorporation of small portions of MA + , Br −
in hybrid perovskites is benefit for stability improvement 18 , 19 . FA 1− x Cs x PbI 3
has been widely recognized as the most attractive material for PSCs exhibiting both high efficiencies and good thermal stability 20 . Until now, the highest certified efficiency of inverted PSCs based on MA + - and Br − -free formamidinium cesium perovskite is only 23.5% with
V OC
of 1.14 V (ref.
11 ). Thus, it is desirable to further optimize inverted PSCs based on the MA + - and Br − -free formamidinium cesium perovskites. So far, key strategies implemented in those high-efficiency inverted PSCs mainly focused on optimizing interfacial materials and surface passivation of perovskite absorber films 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 21 . Beyond these strategies, the management of the bulk and surface defects in perovskite films is of equal importance to achieve an efficient and stable inverted PSCs. In this Article, we report an optimization strategy to simultaneously manage the bulk and surface defects in FA 0.98 Cs 0.02 PbI 3
perovskite films to enable high-performance inverted PSCs. Firstly, a low-volatile dibutyl sulfoxide (DBSO) Lewis base additive with a strong coordination ability was introduced into the
N , N -dimethylformamide (DMF)/ N -methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent system, thus leading to the formation of a stable intermediate phase of DBSO·PbI 2
in the precursor film even after anti-solvent extraction. Such intermediate phase can suppress the formation of undesirable δ-phase FA-perovskite and modulate perovskite crystal growth. The proposed improved film fabrication strategy leads to perovskite films with larger grain size and reduced internal film stress and bulk defects. In addition, 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenethylammonium iodide (denoted as 2CF 3 -PEAI) was introduced as an interface passivator designed to simultaneously adjust interfacial energy levels, passivate surface defects of the perovskite films and stabilize the films against moisture with help from the presence of hydrophobic CF 3
groups. As a result, the devices demonstrated impressive PCEs of up to 25.1% (24.5% from reverse scan was measured by a third-party institution) owing to the use of the high-quality FA 0.98 Cs 0.02 PbI 3
films. Moreover, the encapsulated devices showed stable operation in air under continuous 1-sun air mass (AM) 1.5 G illumination for up to 1,800 h without notable efficiency decay and also pass the damp heat test (85 °C and 85% relative humidity (RH)) according to the international standards for mature photovoltaics (IEC61215). Modulation of perovskite films crystal growth First, we optimized the preparation process of FA 0.98 Cs 0.02 PbI 3 -based perovskite films; a small amount of caesium is introduced to stabilize the black phase of FAPbI 3 -based perovskite 11 . We found that it is easier to prepare pin-hole free FA 1- x Cs x PbI 3 -based films with DMF/NMP solvent mixture rather not the commonly used DMF/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in a N 2 -filled glove box (Supplementary Fig.
1 ), which is similar to the results reported in ref.
22 . Starting from the DMF/NMP solvent, we further modified it by adding DBSO (longer-chain analogue of DMSO) as a coordination agent to modulate the perovskite growth (Supplementary Tables
2
and
3 ). The longer alkyl chains incorporated in DBSO result in its higher boiling point (250 °C versus 189 °C) and stronger electron donating power (Gutmann donor number, 31.0 versus 29.8) as compared with DMSO, which enables more stable coordination with PbI 2
than the DMSO case and also NMP case (donor number of 27.3) as demonstrated below. Such properties play an important role in control of perovskite crystal growth and defects concentration in the resultant FA 1- x Cs x PbI 3
films. The effects of different DBSO additive contents (0%, 5%, 10% and 20%, molar ratio to PbI 2 ) on the morphology and crystal size of perovskite films were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Fig.
1a , the average grain size in the perovskite films gradually increases from 260 to 378 and 466 nm following the increase in the DBSO content from 0% to 5% and then to 10%. When the DBSO content further increases to 20%, the average crystal size slightly decreases to 432 nm (Supplementary Fig.
2 ). When the amount of DBSO further increases to 40%, many micron-level cracks are observed in the resultant perovskite films (Supplementary Fig.
3 ), which may be due to DBSO residue caused by excessive addition (Supplementary Fig.
4 ). Therefore, using an appropriate amount of DBSO is the key factor to improving the film quality.

1b,c
shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the perovskite films before and after annealing with different DBSO content. As can be seen, the non-annealed precursor film with 0% DBSO exhibits a δ-phase diffraction peak at 11.8°, while the addition of DBSO inhibits the formation of δ-phase in the non-annealed films thus leading to the increased amount of α-phase perovskite with the main peak at 14.0° and a new phase with the main peak at 6.3°. Furthermore, increase in the content of DBSO from 5% to 10% and then to 20% is accompanied by the gradual increase in the XRD peak intensity of the new phase, while the peaks of α-phase perovskite gradually decay. These findings indicate that DBSO induces the formation of a new crystalline intermediate phase facilitating the formation of α-phase perovskite. The diffraction peak at 6.3° is attributed to the formation of DBSO·PbI 2
intermediate phase similar to other Lewis base-PbI 2
intermediate phases 10 , 23
(Supplementary Fig.
5 ). The interactions between DBSO, PbI 2
and formamidinium iodide (FAI) are confirmed by comparing the Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectra of the DBSO, DBSO·PbI 2 , FAI and FAI·PbI 2 ·DBSO samples (Fig.
1d , Supplementary Fig.
6
and Supplementary Table
4 ). The sulfoxide S=O bond stretching vibration peak of DBSO located at 1,028 cm −1
shifted to 968 cm −1
in the DBSO·PbI 2
sample, which is owing to the formation of dative bond by sharing the lone pair electrons in oxygen with Pb 2+ . And the C=N double bond stretching vibration peak of FAI at 1,697 cm −1
shifted to 1,712 cm −1
in the FAI·PbI 2 ·DBSO sample. This phenomenon is similar to the peak shift induced by coordination between other Lewis bases to PbI 2
and FAI 22 , 24 . Although it has been widely reported that many Lewis bases can lead to the formation of intermediate phases (for example, DMSO·PbI 2
and NMP·PbI 2 ) in the perovskite precursor films, it is noteworthy that the specific DBSO·PbI 2
intermediate phase is much more stable than NMP·PbI 2 , so it could resist the instantaneous anti-solvent extraction process (Supplementary Figs.
7 – 9 ). Note that the amount of NMP in our solvent system is large, but the amount of the NMP·PbI 2
intermediate phase in the obtained non-annealed films is negligibly low after the anti-solvent washing process. Based on the molecular structures of NMP, DBSO and PbI 2
octahedral, we used density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the interaction energy between PbI 2
and the two coordination molecules (Fig.
1e,f ). The interaction energy between PbI 2
and DBSO (−1.42 eV) is much higher than that between PbI 2
and NMP (−1.03 eV), and also higher than the interaction energy between PbI 2
and DMSO (−1.01 eV; Supplementary Fig.
10 ) due to the stronger electron donating of DBSO than the other two Lewis bases. This difference could explain why the intermediate phase of DBSO·PbI 2
is more stable and more resistant to anti-solvent extraction. Characterization of the perovskite film’s quality XRD patterns of the annealed perovskite films made from different precursor solutions show that all the films transform into α-phase FA 1- x Cs x PbI 3
perovskite after annealing at 150 °C for 20 min (Fig.
1c ). With the increasing content of DBSO loading from 0% to 5% and then to 10%, the XRD peak intensity gradually increases, thus indicating the enhancement of the perovskite crystallinity. This is consistent with the increased grain size upon DBSO addition as observed by SEM. The perovskite crystal growth mechanisms can be explained by two different pathways as described in Fig.
1g . In the case of 0% DBSO sample, the δ-phase transition to α-phase occurs directly during annealing; while in the 10% DBSO sample a molecular exchange between DBSO·PbI 2
intermediate phase and FAI is controlling the α-phase crystal growth upon annealing. It has been widely reported that the intermediate phase or molecular exchange dominated crystal growth could reduce the activation energy of the perovskite crystal formation, which normally leads to larger crystalline grain size in the as-fabricated perovskite films 23 , 25 . We also conducted XRD characterization to monitor the crystal structure evolution from the as-coated films to fully crystallized perovskite films during annealing (Supplementary Fig.
11 ). The obtained results further confirm the important role of the DBSO·PbI 2
intermediate phase in promoting the crystallinity of the obtained α-phase FA 0.98 Cs 0.02 PbI 3
films. When the DBSO content further increases to 20%, the XRD diffraction peak intensity becomes slightly lower, which is also consistent with the SEM data discussed above. It is well known that the internal residual stress in perovskite films can promote the formation of atomic vacancies, increase non-radiative recombination, reduce carrier mobility and structural stability, and thus deteriorate the photovoltaic performance of devices 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 . We employed grazing incident XRD to test the residual stress at the 50 nm and 200 nm depth regions of the perovskite films obtained using different DBSO content (Supplementary Tables
5
and
6 ). The results show that the tensile stress at 200 nm (Fig.
2a
and Supplementary Fig.
12 ) and 50 nm (Fig.
2b
and Supplementary Fig.
13 ) gradually release with the increasing DBSO content from 0% to 5% and then to 10%. In addition, Williamson–Hall analysis also confirmed that the introduction of DBSO can relax the lattice strain (Supplementary Fig.
14 ). This phenomenon may be related to the following two reasons 30 : first, when DBSO·PbI 2
reacts with FAI to form perovskite, the formation energy of α-phase perovskite can be significantly reduced, thereby avoiding the formation of δ-phase nuclei in the precursor film. Thus, the tensile stress caused by cell volume shrinkage during the transformation of δ-phase to α-phase in the case of the 0% DBSO samples could be avoided (Supplementary Fig.
15a,b ). Second, the tensile stress remaining at the grain boundaries due to the lattice expansion during high-temperature annealing of perovskite could be further released by reducing the number of grain boundaries when using optimal concentrations of DBSO additive (Supplementary Fig.
15c ). Fig. 2: Characterization of the perovskite film’s quality. a , b , Residual strain distribution analysis of the film regions with depths of 50 nm ( a ) and 200 nm ( b ) from the surface by linear fitting of 2 θ  − sin 2 φ

2c ) and transient PL spectroscopy (Fig.
2d
and Supplementary Fig.
16 ) were used to evaluate the non-radiative carrier recombination behaviour of the perovskite films made from different DBSO additive content. The results show that the addition of DBSO, especially for 10% content, could effectively suppress the fast non-radiative decay component. As can be seen, benefitted from strain relaxation, the fitted carrier lifetime increases from 423 ns (0% DBSO) to 613 ns (5% DBSO) and finally to 708 ns (10% DBSO). The 20% DBSO sample has a shorter PL lifetime (525 ns), which is consistent with its reduced crystallinity (Fig.
1c ). Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy was further used to analyse the carrier dynamics in the perovskite films with and without DBSO addition (Fig.
2e,f ). It can be seen that the attenuation rate of ground-state bleaching of perovskite film decreases significantly when DBSO is added, and the single exponential kinetic model delivered the lifetimes of 9.89 ns (0% DBSO) and 32.56 ns (10% DBSO) (Supplementary Fig.
17 ) 31 , 32 , which again verified the decrease in defect density within the DBSO-based films. The above results consistently show that using appropriate DBSO loading can effectively release residual stress within the film and reduce defect density due to the ability of this additive to modulate the perovskite crystal growth. These effects inhibit the non-radiative recombination of charge carriers and improve the carrier lifetime. To optimize the content of DBSO, we prepared inverted PSCs with the ITO/p-PY/FA 0.98 Cs 0.02 PbI 3 /PCBM/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag configuration; the typical cross-sectional SEM image of the device is shown in Supplementary Fig.
18 . p-PY is an efficient and stable hole transport material incorporating pyridine core functionalized with poly(triarylamine) units as we reported recently 33 , 34 . Supplementary Fig.
19
shows the current density–voltage ( J–V ) curves of the devices based on the perovskite films with different DBSO content. It can be seen that PCE reaches the highest values when DBSO content is close to 10% (Supplementary Fig.
20 ). As compared with the reference 0% DBSO samples,
J SC
of the 10% DBSO device increases from 24.88 mA cm −2
to 25.68 mA cm −2 ,
V OC
increases from 1.024 V to 1.091 V, fill factor (FF) increases from 0.792 to 0.805, and PCE increases from 20.2% to 22.6% (Supplementary Table
7 ). The improved device performance is assigned to the reduced defect density and improved carrier lifetimes caused by the use of DBSO additive. Effect of the surface passivation In addition to the reduction of bulk defects within the perovskite films by using DBSO additive engineering, we designed phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI) derivatives containing different fluorocarbon (CF 3 ) functional groups as surface modification reagents to further passivate the defects in the perovskite films. Molecular structures of the PEAI derivatives CF 3 -PEAI and 2CF 3 -PEAI are shown in Fig.
3a . Top-view SEM images revealed that the surface morphology of the perovskite films after modifications with PEAI, CF 3 -PEAI and 2CF 3 -PEAI did not change significantly (Supplementary Fig.
21 ), which is consistent with the recent report 35 . To further identify the states of above passivators on the perovskite, we performed TA spectroscopy of the perovskite films treated with PEAI, CF 3 -PEAI and 2CF 3 -PEAI to accurately identify whether 2D phase perovskites were formed in the corresponding perovskite films (Supplementary Fig.
22 ). Both perovskite films showed the characteristic peaks at about 580 nm belonging to
n  = 2 low-dimensional perovskites 21 , which could block minority carriers from the interface/surface 36 .

f , EQE-EL measurements for the series of PSCs assembled without and with different passivation coatings. The inset shows the device with visible red emission. The area is about 0.3 cm × 0.3 cm. Full size image From the viewpoint of molecular engineering, the CF 3
electron-withdrawing groups could adjust the passivators’ molecular dipole moment and hydrophobicity, whereas the size difference among the PEA + , CF 3 -PEA +
and 2CF 3 -PEA +
cations may also influence their diffusion depths into the bulk of perovskite films. To study this point, we conducted time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) measurements on the films (based on F signals; Fig.
3e ). We also used F-PEA +
to substitute PEA +
by deliberately introducing F element but not significantly affect the size of organic cation. It is found that 2CF 3 -PEA +
cations show the shallowest diffusion depth and F-PEA +
cations show the deepest diffusion depth. This observation is due to the 2CF 3 -PEA +
cation having the largest steric hindrance effect, impeding its inward diffusion. This was also confirmed by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profiles (Supplementary Fig.
23 ). The distribution of passivator is considered to affect the surface electrical properties and chemical stability of the films. To study the surface electrical properties of perovskite films with different passivator, the electrostatic potentials ( φ max ) of PEA, CF 3 -PEA and 2CF 3 -PEA were characterized, which were determined to be 183.39, 187.19 and 189.42 kcal mol −1 , respectively. 2CF 3 -PEA has the largest electrostatic potential, that is, the highest dipole moment among the three molecules due to the presence of two CF 3
groups with strong electron-withdrawing ability. The electric field generated by the interfacial dipole can change the vacuum energy level and work function of the adjacent material 37 , 38 , 39 . We further studied this issue by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (Supplementary Fig.
24 ) and ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig.
25 ) measurements. Work functions of the pristine perovskite films and the films treated with PEAI, CF 3 -PEAI or 2CF 3 -PEAI are estimated as 4.83, 4.69, 4.61 and 4.58 eV, respectively (Fig.
3b ). This is almost consistent with the evolution of the film surface potentials measured by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) for the above four conditions (Supplementary Fig.
26 ). The energy level of PCBM was obtained according to previous report 40 . The introduction of an extra back-surface field is an effective way to improve device’s
V OC , which is widely applied in crystalline silicon solar cells and has recently been demonstrated in high-efficiency PSCs 11 , 37 . The extra back electric field caused by the stronger dipole moment of the surface modifiers may be an important factor enabling the device’s higher
V OC
in this work. According to previous reports 41 , 42 , the terminal group of CF 3
has a strong electron-withdrawing ability, making CF 3
capable of forming a hydrogen bond with the amino group in FA +
and reducing the generation of A-site vacancies, thus improving the performance of the device. In addition, the surface passivation of the perovskite absorber films with PEAI, CF 3 -PEAI and 2CF 3 -PEAI can bring additional functions such as compensation of the loss of I −
ions during the annealing process and chelation of the exposed undercoordinated Pb 2+
ions 43 , 44 . The effect of passivators on the carrier dynamic of perovskite films was further studied. Transient PL (Fig.
3c
and Supplementary Fig.
27 ) and steady-state PL (Supplementary Fig.
28 ) spectra show that the non-radiative recombination becomes further inhibited and the fitted PL lifetime is increased from 0.7 (pristine) to 1.1 (PEAI), 1.4 (CF 3 -PEAI) and 1.6 µs (2CF 3 -PEAI), respectively, after the corresponding surface passivation. This tendency indicates that 2CF 3 -PEAI enables the best surface passivation effect among the three studied passivators. The transient PL lifetime (Fig.
3d
and Supplementary Fig.
29 ) of the perovskite/PCBM stacks reflects the difference in interfacial charge transfer rate after the surface passivation. In principle, the Shockley–Read–Hall lifetime as extracted from the slower decay ( τ 2 ) is related to the important interfacial recombination 45 . The 2CF 3 -PEAI-treated perovskite films show longer lifetime at the same excitation condition, which indicates that 2CF 3 -PEAI enables the best surface passivation effect among the three studied passivators. The obtained results show that the PL lifetime is increased from 21.3 (pristine) to 38.9 (PEAI), 34.6 (CF 3 -PEAI) and finally to 23.5 ns (2CF 3 -PEAI). In comparison with their strongly positive effect on carrier lifetimes within the perovskite absorber films, the modification has negligible impact on the resultant devices’
J SC 37 . The lowest 2D perovskite signals in 2CF 3 -PEAI sample indicates that the introduction of two CF 3
groups could suppress the formation of 2D perovskite, which may be helpful for defect passivation. The above results confirm that 2CF 3 -PEAI possesses the best surface defects passivation capability, which might be related to its shallowest diffusion depth as compared with other studied organic cations 46 . The loss of iodine caused by thermal annealing mainly happens at the surface of the perovskite film. Thus, 2CF 3 -PEAI with its low diffusion depth could enrich the perovskite surface with iodide thus leading to efficient defect passivation. The large size of 2CF 3 -PEAI also prevents its deep diffusion into the interior of the film, which could destroy the ideal three-dimensional (3D) perovskite lattice. Figure
3f
shows the external quantum efficiencies of electroluminescence (EQE-EL) of PSCs based on the perovskite films with different passivators. It is well known that
V OC
of a solar cell is directly related to its internal luminescence efficiency 44 . In this case, when the injection current density is set to the value equal to
J SC
under solar illumination, EQE-EL of the pristine device is 0.2%. EQE-EL of the PEAI, CF 3 -PEAI and 2CF 3 -PEAI surface passivated devices were shown to be 0.8%, 1.5% and 5.2%, respectively. Based on the formula Δ V OC  =  k B T / q ln(EQE passivation /EQE pristine ) 44 , it can be estimated that the
V OC
improvement after surface passivation with PEAI, CF 3 -PEAI and 2CF 3 -PEAI are 36, 52 and 84 mV, respectively. The tendency is well consistent with the experimentally observed
V OC
variation in the devices discussed below. To quantify the
V OC
potential for every individual stack, we calculated the internal electron-hole quasi-Fermi level splitting from PLQY results (Supplementary Figs.
30
and
31 ) according to previous method 47 , 48 , which indicated effectively suppressing non-radiative recombination by interface passivation. Performance and stability of PSCs Figure
4a
shows the
J–V
curves of the p-i-n PSCs without and with different surface passivation. It was observed that
J SC
does not change significantly and the enhancement of PCE associated with the surface passivation is mainly due to the increase in
V OC
and FF (Supplementary Table
8 ). The champion PCE reached for the 2CF 3 -PEAI passivated device was 25.1%, with a
J SC
of 25.88 mA cm −2 , a
V OC
of 1.176 V and an FF of 0.825, while the hysteresis effect was negligible (Supplementary Fig.
32 ). The steady-state PCE of the device was 25.0% (Supplementary Fig.
33 ), which is very close to the PCE obtained from the reverse voltage sweep
J – V
curve. EQE spectrum of the corresponding device is shown in Supplementary Fig.
34 . The integral short circuit current density calculated from the EQE spectrum is 25.74 mA cm −2 , which is nearly identical to the
J SC
value extracted from
J–V
measurements. We also sent one of the best devices to a credible third-party organization and got a certified efficiency of 24.5%, with
J SC
of 25.75 mA cm −2 ,
V OC
of 1.167 V and FF of 0.815 (Supplementary Fig.
35 ). Furthermore, the device performance was very well reproducible (Fig.
4b
and Supplementary Fig.
36 ). Although the efficiency of the fabricated devices is still a little bit lower than that of the best regular PSCs, the measured operation lifetime of our inverted PSCs is much longer. This indicates the potential advantage of inverted PSCs in simultaneously achieving high efficiency and long-term operational stability.

Source data Full size image Besides the impact on photovoltaic performance, defects also considerably affect device operational stability because defect sites disrupt the original lattice arrangement and thus change the thermodynamic energy of the perovskite decomposition and phase change 49 . To study the influence of our defects management strategy on the device stability, we monitored the long-term ageing behaviour of the encapsulated devices based on different passivators using maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under continuous AM 1.5 G 100 mW cm −2
illumination in ambient air (cell temperature 50 ± 5 °C, 50 ± 5% RH) (Fig.
4c ). The device based on pristine perovskite films (initial PCE 21.4%) degraded to 67.2% of its initial PCE after 780 h. The PEAI and CF 3 -PEAI passivated devices (initial PCEs of 22.3% and 23.6%, respectively) degraded correspondingly to 72.3% and 82.1% of their initial PCEs after 1,800 h. The 2CF 3 -PEAI passivated device (initial PCE 24.5%) still retained 97.4% of the initial PCE after 1,800 h; the screen capture image demonstrating its continuous power output within almost the entire testing time is shown in Supplementary Fig.
37 . Since the defects at surface and grain boundaries are the active sites where perovskites have loose chemical binding, which facilitate severe ion migration and degradation, the most effective passivation of 2CF 3 -PEAI and the highest surface hydrophobicity (Fig.
4c ) are considered as the main reason for operational stability improvement. This is further supported by the highest activation energy of perovskite degradation of 2CF 3 -PEAI passivation versus the other passivator (Supplementary Figs.
38
and
39 ). The higher hydrophobicity of the 2CF 3 -PEAI modified samples could minimize the effect of the absorbed water and oxygen on the stability of encapsulated PSCs. The highest stability of the 2CF 3 -PEAI passivated perovskite films can be further proved by the in situ PL measurements combined with laser light ageing (Supplementary Fig.
40 ). It should be emphasized that other important factor enabling that improved device operational stability is the elimination of MA +
cations and Br −
anions from the perovskite absorber composition as discussed above. Indeed, comparing the stability of the PSCs based on conventional MAPbI 3
and Cs 0.15 FA 0.85 Pb(I 0.95 Br 0.05 ) 3
perovskite films and the introduced here FA 0.98 Cs 0.02 PbI 3
absorber formulations processed using 0% or 5% DBSO additive with 2CF 3 -PEAI passivation features the importance of several complementary parameters required to reach long operational lifetimes (Supplementary Figs.
41 – 43 ). Thus, the superior operational stability of the PSCs reported here is the result of multifactorial comprehensive optimization involving the proper selection of univalent cations (FA +
and Cs + ), halide anions (I −
only systems), solvent and intermediate phase engineering as well as designing efficient passivation coatings. In addition to the enhanced operational lifetime, the damp heat stability of the devices has also been tested in accordance with IEC61215 standard. The 2CF 3 -PEAI treated devices (average initial PCE of 24.8%) could retain 98.2% of their initial performance after ageing at 85 °C/85% RH for 1,000 h (Fig.
4d
and Supplementary Fig.
44 ). Meanwhile, the devices based on pristine perovskite films and the films with PEAI and CF 3 -PEAI passivation coatings degraded under the same ageing conditions to 71.3%, 87.2% and 91.1% of their initial PCEs, respectively. These results further confirm the notable impact of a close-to-ideal perovskite film with the lowest defect density, reduced internal residue stress and higher surface hydrophobicity on the device’s stability. Conclusions In summary, we report the strategy to improve the quality of both bulk and surface of FA 0.98 Cs 0.02 PbI 3
perovskite films to enable high-performance inverted PSCs. First, we use a low-volatile DBSO Lewis base additive with a strong coordination ability to improve the crystallinity, reduce the defect density and internal residual stress of the perovskite bulk. Then, 2CF 3 -PEAI was introduced as an interface passivator designed to optimize the energy levels, passivate defects and protect the film against moisture. The inverted PSCs achieve 25.1% efficiency and improved stability. The devices maintained 97.4% and 98.2% of their initial PCEs after operating under continuous 1-sun AM 1.5 G illumination for 1,800 h and under the damp heat conditions (85 °C and 85% RH) for 1,000 h. This work not only provides a novel avenue to engineer efficient and stable inverted PSCs, but also deepens the understanding of the correlation between the device performance to the MA + - and Br − -free perovskite bulk and surface properties. Methods Materials p-PY was synthesized according to our previous report 33 . Lead (II) iodide (PbI 2 , 99.99%), caesium iodide (>99.0%), FAI (99.99%) and BCP (>99%) were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry. PCBM was purchased from Lumtec. The organic halide salts (PEAI, CF 3 -PEAI and 2CF 3 -PEAI) were synthesized according to the method similar to the reported for PEAI in the literature 50 . All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Silver and bismuth with high purity (99.99%) were purchased from Sino-Platinum Metals. The preparation of adduct powders For the PbI 2 ·NMP adduct, 461 mg PbI 2
was dissolved in 654 mg NMP and stirred at 45 °C for 12 h before use. Then 400 μl solution was spin-coated onto glass substrate (5 × 5 cm 2 ) at 1,000 r.p.m. for 150 s. The film was peeled off by a knife and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 2 h; the obtained material was used for FTIR and XRD measurements. For the FAI·PbI 2 ·NMP adduct, 172 mg FAI and 461 mg PbI 2
were dissolved in 654 mg NMP and stirred at 45 °C for 12 h before use. Then 400 μl solution was spin-coated onto glass substrate (5 × 5 cm 2 ) at 1,000 r.p.m. for 150 s. The film was peeled off by a knife and dried at 50 °C in a vacuum oven for 2 h; the material was used for FTIR measurement. For the PbI 2 ·DBSO adduct, 461 mg PbI 2
and 82.1 mg DBSO were dissolved in 600 mg DMF and stirred at 45 °C for 12 h before using. Then 400 μl solution was spin-coated onto glass substrate (5 × 5 cm 2 ) at 1,000 r.p.m. for 150 s. The film was peeled off by a knife and dried at 80 °C in a vacuum oven for 3 h; the collected material was used for FTIR and XRD measurements. For the FAI·PbI 2 ·DBSO adduct, 172 mg FAI and 461 mg PbI 2
and 82.1 mg DBSO were dissolved in 600 mg DMF and stirred at 45 °C for 12 h before using. Then 400 μl solution was spin-coated onto glass substrate (5 × 5 cm 2 ) at 1,000 r.p.m. for 150 s. The film was peeled off by a knife and dried at 80 °C in vacuum oven for 3 h; the collected material was used for FTIR measurement. Device fabrication Glass/ITO substrates (15 Ω sq −1 ) were consecutively cleaned by sequential ultrasonication for 20 min with detergent solution, de-ionized water, ethyl alcohol and isopropanol. The cleaned substrates were dried with high-pressure N 2
gas flow, and then were cleaned by UV-ozone treatment for 30 min and finally transferred into a N 2 -filled glove box before use. The p-PY solution was prepared with a concentration of 0.5 mg ml −1
in CHCl 3 . The as-prepared p-PY solution was spin-coated onto the ITO substrates at 1,500 r.p.m. for 30 s, and the substrates were subsequently annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The FA 0.98 Cs 0.02 PbI 3
perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 252.8 mg FAI, 691.5 mg PbI 2
and 7.8 mg caesium iodide in 1 ml DMF:NMP (6:1 by volume ratio). To prepare the precursor solutions with DBSO (5–20 mol% with respect to PbI 2 ), the additive was added to the DMF: NMP precursor solution. Then the perovskite solution was spin-coated on the substrate at 5,000 r.p.m. for 60 s. At the 12th second of spinning, 500 μl of ethyl acetate was dripped onto the substrate centre. The as-coated precursor films were subsequently annealed on a hotplate at 150 °C for 20 min. Then 100 μl of PEAI, CF 3 -PEAI or 2CF 3 -PEAI (1 mg ml −1
in IPA) were spin-coated onto the as-prepared perovskite films at a speed of 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s; the films were subsequently dried at 100 °C for 5 min. Then a chlorobenzene solution of PCBM (20 mg ml −1 ) was spin-coated on top of the perovskite films (passivated or not) at the rotation speed of 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s and heated at 70 °C for 10 min. In the final step, BCP (8 nm) and Ag (80 nm) were deposited in high vacuum (pressure below 5 × 10 −4
Pa) while finely controlling the evaporation rate at 0.1, 0.1 and 0.1–0.5 Å s −1 , respectively. The Bi/Ag (20 nm/80 nm) electrodes in the devices used for stability tests were thermally evaporated with a controlled evaporation rate of 0.1 and 0.1–0.5 Å s −1 , respectively. Computational details The calculation model is to calculate the adsorption energy of DBSO, NMP and DMSO on the surface of PbI 2
to characterize the interaction strength between different molecules and PbI 2 . Specifically, the adsorption energy can be obtained by using the following formula:
\(\triangle E={E}_{{{\mathrm{Pb}}}{{\mathrm{I}}}_{2}{\cdot {\mathrm{DBSO}}}}-{E}_{{{\mathrm{Pb}}}{{\mathrm{I}}}_{2}}-{E}_{{{\mathrm{DBSO}}}}\) . The adsorption sites are O atom in organic molecule and Pb atom in PbI 2
substrate. The structures of PbI 2 , DBSO, NMP and DMSO are fully optimized during the calculation. The first-principles calculations were carried out by using the projector-augmented wave representations with DFT as implemented in the Vienna ab-initio simulation package 51 , 52 , 53 . The exchange and correlation energy were approximated by the spin-polarized generalize-gradient-approximation with Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof formula 54 . Wave functions were expanded in plane waves up to a kinetic energy cut-off of 500 eV. Γ-centred
k -meshes grids of 2 × 2 × 1 was used for slab calculations. To treat the van der Waals interactions, DFT-D3 correction method of Grimme was used 55 . All structures were fully relaxed until the force on each atom was smaller than 0.01 eV/Å. The electrostatic potentials ( φ ) of the passivators were calculated using the Gaussian 09 package at the B3LYP/def2TZVP level with DFT-D3 (ref.
56 ). The maximum
φ
( φ max ) of the NH 3 +
terminal group in these passivators was obtained with the help of Multiwfn code. Characterizations KPFM measurements were conducted using a dimension icon scanning probe microscope (Asylum Research, MFP-3D-Stand Alone) in the tapping mode. KPFM measurements were carried out using an atomic force microscopy under ambient conditions, using a gold-coated Si tip. The KPFM measurement was implemented using a two-path method at a scan rate of 0.5 Hz, where the first pass in every scan line was used to determine the topography and the following second pass was used to measure the contact potential difference between the tip and the sample. The second pass was scanned by raising the tip at a fixed 20 nm height above the sample following the topography. Each set of samples was arranged in proximity on a common substrate and was measured using the same tip and scanning parameters. SEM images were obtained using a Nova NanoSEM 450 scanning electron microscope (FEI). An XPS system (Thermo ESCALAB 250XI) was used to acquire the XPS spectra. UPS spectra were acquired using a Thermo ESCALAB 250XI instrument equipped with a
1 He ultraviolet radiation source (21.22 eV). The both UPS and KPFM are surface-sensitive measurements. The crystal structure of the films was characterized using XRD with an Empyrean X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (PANalytical B.V.). The UV–vis spectra of perovskite films were obtained using a Lambda 950 UV–vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer). The steady-state PL spectra were recorded using an Edinburgh FLS920 fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh) with an excitation source wavelength of 532 nm. The transient fluorescence spectroscopy (TRPL) measurements were conducted using a fluorescence spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 478 nm (DeltaFlex, Horiba), and the excitation pulse has a repetition rate of 100 kHz with a spot size of 100 μm. The applied excitation fluences were varied between 8.9 nJ cm –2
and 56.3 nJ cm –2
by using neutral density filters. the TRPL profiles were fitted by a bi-exponential decay rate model according to the following function:
y  =  A 1
exp(− t / τ 1 ) +  A 2
exp(− t / τ 2 ) +  y 0,
where
τ 1
and
τ 2
are the lifetimes for the fast and slow decays, respectively. The femtosecond transient absorption measurements were performed on a Helios spectrometer (Ultrafast Systems) pumped by a Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier (Legend Elite, Coherent) operating at 5 kHz with fundamental wavelength of 800 nm and pulse width of ~40 fs. Briefly, the 800 nm output pulse by a Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier was split in two parts. One part was used to pump a TOPAS Optical Parametric Amplifier (Light Conversion), which generates a wavelength-tunable laser pulse from 250 nm to 2.5 µm as pump beam. Another part was attenuated with a neutral density filter and focused into sapphire window to generate a white light continuum (420 nm to 840 nm) used for probe beam. The delay between the pump and probe pulses was controlled by a motorized delay stage. The pump pulses were chopped by a synchronized chopper at 500 Hz, and the absorbance change was calculated with two adjacent probe pulses (pump-blocked and pump-unblocked). All experiments were performed at room temperature. The transient absorption test of perovskite films without DBSO and with 10% DBSO is performed with incident wavelength of 520 nm and incident light excitation power of 0.3 µW. The repetition rate of the TA system is 5,000 Hz, and the diameter of the pump beam spot is 100 μm. Considering that the perovskite film has a high absorption coefficient, to detect the transmitted light more clearly, in all the transient absorption tests, we dilute the perovskite solution to 0.75 M to prepare samples. When we are using 0.3 μW excitation power, we did not observe the signal of 2D perovskite phase due to the small excitation power. To demonstrate the formation of 2D perovskite phase on the surface of perovskite. Keeping other test conditions unchanged, we increased the power to 15 μW to observe that the perovskite films were modified with PEAI, CF 3 -PEAI and 2CF 3 -PEAI. Photovoltaic measurements were carried out using a black mask with an aperture area of 0.09 cm 2
under standard AM 1.5 G simulated illumination (Oriel, model 9119), and the simulated light intensity was calibrated with a silicon photodiode (KG3, Enlitech). The PLQY was carried out via exciting the corresponding samples by a 405 nm laser inside an integrated sphere. The laser intensity was adjusted to 1 sun equivalent intensity using a PSC to obtain a current density at 0 V equal to its
J SC . TOF-SIMS measurements were performed using a TOF-SIMS V instrument (IONTOF GmbH, 170 Cameca IMS 4F). The EQE spectra were obtained with EQE system (Saifan) using monochromatic light of 1 × 10 16
photons cm −2
in direct current mode. The EQE-EL spectra were recorded by a light emitting diode PL quantum-yield measurement system (Shenzhen Puyan Internet Technology) equipped with Keithley 2400 Source Measurement Unit. Encapsulation For PSC encapsulation, the devices were firstly encapsulated by atomic-layer-deposited Al 2 O 3
thin films with the thickness of approximately 20 nm according to our previous report 9 . Then the tinned copper ribbons were soldered to the electrodes of the devices to extend the connections. And the device was encapsulated by a cover glass with edges sealed by butyl tape with 1 cm in width. The stack was vacuum laminated in an industrial laminator at 120 °C for 20 min. Stability tests For the stability tests, a thin film of Bi with a thickness of 20 nm was inserted before the deposition of Ag, which could enhance the electrodes anti-corrosive stability according to our previous report 40 . To perform the damp-heat test of the encapsulated devices, we kept the solar cells at 85 °C/85% RH in the environmental test chamber for 1,000 h. The encapsulated devices were measured periodically after 20 min cooling in ambient air. The operational stability of the encapsulated PSCs was measured by a home-made multichannel stability test system operating in the MPPT mode. The operational stability measurements were carried out by putting the encapsulated devices into a xenon lamp ageing test chamber (Zhenghang Instrument). It should be noted that the illumination was generated by a commercial xenon lamp chamber with AM 1.5 G filter with automatic power reinforcement after fading and black body temperature (50 ± 5 °C, equal to cell temperature). The light intensity was calibrated to achieve the same
J SC
from the PSCs measured under a standard solar simulator (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm −2 ). During MPPT,
J–V
characteristic curves of the devices were periodically measured every 24 h. Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the

Abstract Two-dimensional (2D) and quasi-2D modifications of three-dimensional (3D) perovskite active layers have contributed to advances in the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the ionic diffusion between the surface 2D and bulk 3D perovskites leads to the degradation of the 3D/2D perovskite heterostructures and limits the long-term stability of PSCs. Here we incorporate a cross-linked polymer (CLP) on the top of a 3D perovskite layer and then deposit a 2D perovskite layer via a vapour-assisted two-step process to form a 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure. Photoluminescence spectra and thickness-profiled elemental analysis indicate that the CLP stabilizes the heterostructure by inhibiting the diffusion of cations (formamidinium, FA +
and 4-fluorophenylethylammonium, 4F-PEA + ) between the 2D and 3D perovskites. For devices based on carbon electrodes, we report small-area devices with an efficiency of 21.2% and mini-modules with an efficiency of 19.6%. Devices retain 90% of initial performance after 4,390 hours operation under maximum power point tracking and one-sun illumination at elevated temperatures.

Main Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently undergone a rapid rise in certified power-conversion efficiencies (PCEs) to exceed 25% for sub-1 cm 2
PSCs 1 , 2 , 3 , 4
and 20% for perovskite solar modules (PSMs) 5 , 6 , 7 . Many of the best PSCs employ two-dimensional (2D) or quasi-2D modified (three-dimensional) 3D perovskite (3D/2D perovskite) heterostructures, which provide defect passivation 8 , 9 , 10
and favourable band alignment 11 , 12 , 13
and thus can improve open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) and fill factor (FF) 14 , 15 , 16 . These 3D/2D perovskite heterostructures are commonly prepared by spin coating an organic cation salt solution on top of 3D perovskites and in situ formation of thin low-dimensional perovskites (such as 2D and quasi-2D) on the surface 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 . The ion diffusion between the surface 2D and bulk 3D perovskites (for example, cations in the 3D perovskite layer move towards the 2D layer) is known to contribute to the degradation of 3D/2D perovskite heterostructures under bias, illumination and heat 13 , 21 , 22 . Currently, the long-term operational stability of these highly efficient PSCs is limited to <2,000 hours at room temperature, and ~500 hours at elevated temperatures (≥60 °C) under maximum power point (MPP) tracking and continuous illumination (Supplementary Table
1 ). For ion diffusion within the perovskite absorbing layer, mitigation strategies have been sought after via halide compositional tuning 23 , 24 , 25 , the incorporation of large organic cations 26 , 27 , 28 , 29
and the introduction of ionic additives 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 . For ion diffusion across interfaces and the stacked layers within PSCs, the construction of interlayers has been proven effective 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 . In particular, Bi et al. chose tri- s -triazine-based graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets to form an iodide diffusion barrier layer in p–i–n PSCs 35 . Wang et al. deposited a chlorinated graphene oxide layer between the perovskite and hole transporting layer (HTL) in n–i–p PSCs to prevent the iodide ions in the perovskite layer from diffusing into the HTL 36 . However, inhibiting ion diffusion between the 3D and 2D perovskites and stabilizing the 3D/2D perovskite heterostructures remains an ongoing challenge 13 , 21 , 22 . To construct a stable 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure, we propose to introduce an interlayer between the 3D and 2D perovskite layers. The interlayer needs to effectively inhibit ion diffusion and, meanwhile, not hinder charge transport between the 3D and 2D perovskite layers. For the deposition of the interlayer and 2D perovskite layer, the technique and process need to be operated without degrading or damaging the underlying layers. Comparing small molecules versus regular polymers as the interlayer, we found that a highly cross-linked polymer (CLP) was more effective at inhibiting ion diffusion and stabilizing the 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure. We selected a polymer prepared by self-polymerization of ethylene dimethacrylate (EDMA) and polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) under moderate conditions (≤100 °C) and processed the polymer layer from a solution that does not degrade the 3D perovskite. For simplicity, CLP represents the POSS–EDMA-based polymer below. At the same time, we developed a vapour-assisted two-step deposition process to form the 2D perovskite layer on the 3D perovskite/CLP bilayer, which prevented the destruction of the underlying 3D perovskite during the deposition of the 2D perovskite. We fabricated carbon-electrode-based PSCs using the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure with an efficiency of 21.2% (aperture area of 0.16 cm 2 ), and demonstrate a carbon-electrode-based PSM with a certified efficiency of 18.2% (aperture area of 17.1 cm 2 ). The cell achieved a
T 90
(the time taken for device efficiency to reduce to 90% of its initial value) of 4,390 hours under one-sun illumination and MPP tracking at 60 °C, showing superior stability compared with the PSCs based on conventional 3D/2D perovskite heterostructures at elevated temperatures. Selection of CLP The molecular structures of EDMA, POSS, CLP and preparation process of the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure are presented in Fig.
1a . For the design and selection of CLP, it should inhibit the diffusion of FA +
and 4F-PEA +
cations between the 3D and 2D perovskite layers and stabilize the 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure. Some organic materials including small molecules and polymers were screened based on an experiment studying the reactions of lead bromide (PbBr 2 )/organic films with formamidinium iodide (FAI) or 4-fluorophenylethylammonium iodide (4F-PEAI) (Fig.
1b ). These organic materials include a small molecular EDMA monomer; three linear polymers of polyethylene glycol (PEG), polystyrene (PS) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) (Supplementary Fig.
1 ) and two cross-linked polymers of EDMA (pEDMA) and the CLP. We decided to investigate pEDMA and the CLP by taking inspiration from rechargeable batteries or fuel cells, where ion diffusion is inhibited by inserting separation materials (such as POSS- and EDMA-based polymers) as proton exchange membranes 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 . POSS consists of a rigid, cubic Si–O–Si cage-type core with eight ethylene groups that can bridge the linear EDMA chains in various directions via olefin polymerization. Approximately 3 mol% POSS dispersed in EDMA provides abundant cross-linking points and leads to the formation of a polymer film with highly cross-linked networks 44 , 45 , 46 . When the self-polymerization was carried out on a glass substrate, a uniform and free-standing transparent CLP film was obtained (Supplementary Fig.
2 ). The self-polymerization reaction was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) (Supplementary Fig.
3 ). Moreover, the CLP film was found to be insoluble in polar solvents such as H 2 O, isopropanol (IPA) and dimethylformamide (DMF) (Supplementary Fig.

b , Schematic for investigating the effectiveness of different polymers at inhibiting ion diffusion. The polymer layer is deposited by spin coating PEG, PS, PMMA and CLP solutions (10 mg ml −1 ) at 1,000 r.p.m. for 20 s. Then the films are dipped either in a FAI solution (20 mg ml − 1
in IPA) or a 4F-PEAI solution (20 mg ml − 1
in IPA). The photos of pristine PbBr 2
and PbBr 2
with different covering layers before and after dipping in FAI and 4F-PEAI solutions are shown for comparison.

d , XRD patterns of pristine PbBr 2
and PbBr 2
covered with different polymers after dipping in the 4F-PEAI solution. Full size image Pristine PbBr 2
films are transparent and colourless. However, PbBr 2
films dipped in FAI or 4F-PEAI solutions rapidly turn brown or yellow. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements verified the formation of 3D FAPb(I x Br 1− x ) 3
(brown) and 2D 4F-PEA 2 Pb(I x Br 1− x ) 4
(yellow) 47 , 48 , 49 , as shown in Fig.
1c,d . For PbBr 2
films covered by PEG, PS, PMMA and EDMA monomers, similar phenomena were observed. This indicates that these small molecules and linear polymers are not ideal candidates for inhibiting the diffusion of FA +
and 4F-PEA +
cations. On the contrary, the PbBr 2 /pEDMA and PbBr 2 /CLP films maintained their original colour after dipping in FAI or 4F-PEAI solution. The XRD patterns show the PbBr 2
films were not fully transformed into 3D FAPb(I x Br 1− x ) 3
or 2D 4F-PEA 2 Pb(I x Br 1− x ) 4 , which indicates that the cross-linked pEDMA and CLP layer can effectively inhibit the diffusion of FA +
and 4F-PEA +
cations. Meanwhile, the formation of a small 2D diffraction peak in the PbBr 2 /pEDMA and PbBr 2 /CLP films indicates a small amount of FA +
and 4F-PEA +
can still pass through the CLP layer to form 3D or 2D perovskites (Fig.
1c,d
and Supplementary Note
1 ). Our further studies show that the CLP layer is more effective at inhibiting ion diffusion and has better stability under thermal stress due to the incorporation of POSS (Supplementary Figs.

and

2 ). Stabilization effect of CLP on perovskite heterostructures To fabricate the conventional 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure, we deposit a (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05
(formamidinium, FA; methylammonium, MA) 3D perovskite layer on a SnO 2 -coated ITO glass substrate and then post-treat the surface with a solution of 4-fluorophenylethylammonium iodide (4F-PEAI) in IPA solvent (Fig.
2a ) 8 , 17 , 50 . XRD patterns in Fig.
2b
show a characteristic diffraction peak at 5.2°, which indicates the formation of 2D 4F-PEA 2 PbI 4
((4F-PEA) 2 FA n −1 Pb n I 3 n +1 ,
n  = 1) 17 , 49 . After thermal ageing at 100 °C for 120 min, the 2D 4F-PEA 2 PbI 4
diffraction peak in the 3D/2D heterostructure disappears. Additionally, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra show that the emission peaks of 3D (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05
and 2D 4F-PEA 2 PbI 4
are located at 800 nm and 511 nm respectively for the 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure (Fig.
2c ). After thermal ageing, the emission peak of 4F-PEA 2 PbI 4
for the 3D/2D heterostructure also completely disappears. These results are indicative of the instability of the 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure, which is attributed to ion diffusion between the surface 2D and bulk 3D perovskites 21 , 22 .

g , TA spectra of 3D/2D and 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructures before and after ageing. Full size image To fabricate the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure, we first deposited a 3D perovskite layer. The CLP layer is formed by spin coating a POSS and EDMA mixed solution in chlorobenzene and ethyl acetate mixed solvent on the above 3D perovskite and annealing at 100 °C for 10 min (Supplementary Fig.
7 ). These low-polarity solvents are compatible with 3D perovskites and thus do not induce degradation of the 3D perovskite. The thickness of the CLP layer is estimated to be <3 nm (Supplementary Fig.
8
and Supplementary Note
3 ). The 2D perovskite layer was deposited by a vapour-assisted two-step process 51 , 52 , 53 . Lead iodide (PbI 2 ) was first evaporated on the CLP layer and then a 4-fluorophenylethylammonium iodide (4F-PEAI) 17 , 50
solution (15 mmol in IPA) was spun on the above 3D/CLP/PbI 2
stacked film and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min (Supplementary Note

details the selection of 4F-PEAI). XRD spectra in Fig.
2b
show a stronger characteristic diffraction peak at 5.2° for the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure than the 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure, which indicates the formation of a thicker 2D perovskite layer 49 , 50 . The cross-sectional SEM images show a ~500 nm 3D perovskite layer and a ~10 nm low-dimensional perovskite layer for the 3D/2D heterostructure and a ~500 nm 3D perovskite layer, a several nanometre CLP layer and a thicker ~30 nm 2D perovskite layer for the 3D/CLP/2D heterostructure (Fig.
2a ). The XRD spectrum of the aged 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure shows that the characteristic diffraction peak at 5.2° remains relatively unchanged. A similar effect is observed for the PL spectra, where the PL emission peaks for the aged 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure retain their initial positions and intensities (Fig.
2c ). A thick 2D perovskite layer was directly prepared on a 3D perovskite without the CLP layer by the same vapour-assisted two-step process as in the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure. Notably, the red-shift PL peak position of the 2D perovskite in the 3D/thick 2D (vapour-deposited) heterostructure compared with the normal solution-processed 3D/2D heterostructure is attributed to the difference in thickness and quantum confinement effect 50 , 54 . The intensity of the PL emission peak of 4F-PEA 2 PbI 4
largely decreases, and a new peak corresponding to 4F-PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
( n  = 2) appears after thermal ageing of the 3D/thick 2D heterostructure 21 , 22 . This indicates that the 3D/thick 2D heterostructure shows better stability than normal solution-processed 3D/2D heterostructure; however, its stability remains inferior to that of the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure. The PL spectra of the heterostructure using EDMA as the interlayer showed similar behaviour with that of the 3D/thick 2D heterostructure (Fig.
2d ). pEDMA as the interlayer resulted in suppression of the formation of the peak for 4F-PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7 ; however, the intensity of the PL emission peak of 4F-PEA 2 PbI 4
still decreased. These results indicate that the CLP layer plays the dominant role of stabilizing the 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure under thermal stress. To correlate the degradation of the 2D perovskite to ion diffusion, we employed atomic force microscopy-based infrared spectroscopy (AFM-IR) measurements to investigate the surface properties of the perovskite heterostructures. Imaging results were recorded at 1,712 cm −1 , which corresponds to the symmetric C = NH 2 +
bending of FA + . As shown in Fig.
2e , initially, the 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure showed distinct signals of FA +
cations, while there were low signals of FA +
cations in the initial 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure. This indicated that the 2D perovskite layer in the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure achieved more complete and uniform coverage on the 3D perovskite layer than that in the 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure. After the perovskite heterostructures are aged at 100 °C for 120 min, the FA +
signals largely increase on the surface of the 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure, which indicates the upward diffusion of FA +
ions and the phase transformation from the 2D perovskite of 4F-PEA 2 PbI 4
into 3D perovskite during thermal stress. On the contrary, the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure shows an almost unchanged FA +
signal, which verifies the limited ion diffusion between the 3D and 2D perovskites and the enhanced stability of the 3D/CLP/2D heterostructure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra show that the characteristic peaks of N in FA +
for the 3D perovskite layer and 4F-PEA +
for the 2D perovskite layer are at 400.8 eV and at 402.0 eV, respectively (Supplementary Fig.
9 ). XPS depth profiling in Fig.
2f
shows that the characteristic peak of F in 4F-PEA +
can be detected only on the top surface for ~45 s. For the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure, 4F-PEA +
can be detected on the film surface for ~120 s, which is also indicative of the thicker 2D layer in the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure. Meanwhile, the downward diffusion of 4F-PEA +
ions in the 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure is observed after thermal ageing, which is inhibited by the CLP layer in the 3D/CLP/2D heterostructure. Furthermore, we conducted ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy measurements of 3D/2D and 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructures as shown in Fig.
2g 55 , 56 . Both initial perovskite heterostructures show the characteristic peaks at 773 nm from 3D perovskite, and at 515 nm from 2D perovskite 4F-PEA 2 PbI 4
( n  = 1) 56 . Additionally, small
n  = 2 2D perovskite peaks are also observed for the two heterostructures. This indicates that a small amount of FA +
diffuses into the 2D perovskite through the CLP layer to form
n  = 2 perovskites. After ageing at 100 °C for 120 min, the characteristic peak from 4F-PEA 2 PbI 4
( n  = 1) for the 3D/2D heterostructure almost completely vanished, while the peak for the 3D/CLP/2D heterostructure remained unchanged. Thus, we conclude that the CLP layer not only largely inhibits the ion (including both FA +
and 4F-PEA + ) diffusion between the stacked perovskite layers but also effectively stabilize the phase states of the 3D and 2D perovskites under thermal stress. Charge carrier dynamics and device performance To investigate the carrier dynamics within the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure and with perovskite/HTL stacks, we conducted time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements. On glass substrates, the 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure and the 3D/CLP film show longer average carrier lifetimes ( τ avg ) (315 ns and 341 ns) than the pristine 3D perovskite (248 ns) (Fig.
3a
and Supplementary Table
4 ). The
τ avg
of the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure further increases to 423 ns. This is indicative of synergistic passivation from the CLP and 2D perovskite. When a 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis ( N , N -di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) layer was deposited on top of the samples, the 3D perovskite, 3D/2D, 3D/CLP and 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructures show similar
τ avg
and
τ 1
(Fig.
3b ). This indicates efficient charge extraction from the perovskites to the HTL can still be achieved after incorporating the CLP layer in the perovskite heterostructure. Consistent results were also obtained for the steady-state PL spectra (Supplementary Fig.
10 ). Space charge-limited current spectra 57 , 58 , 59
of the perovskite heterostructures show that the 3D/2D and 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructures generate current density–voltage ( J – V ) curves with similar shapes and comparable current values (Supplementary Figs.
11
and
12 ) for both electron-only and hole-only devices. By fitting the linear regions, the electron and hole mobilities of the 3D/CLP/2D heterostructure are similar compared with that of the 3D perovskite or 3D/2D heterostructure. Thus, the CLP layer has not hindered the transport of either the electrons or the holes within the heterostructures.

Source data Full size image We conducted ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and ultraviolet–visible absorption spectroscopy (UV–vis) measurements to estimate the energy levels of the perovskite heterostructures (Supplementary Fig.
13 ). Compared with the 3D perovskite (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 , the incorporation of the CLP on the 3D perovskite leads to negligible change of the bandgap (1.55 eV), conduction band minimum and valence band maximum (Fig.
3c ). The 2D perovskite 4F-PEA 2 PbI 4
possesses a much larger bandgap of 2.36 eV and forms type-I band alignment with the 3D perovskite 60 . The close valence band maximum position of the 3D and 2D perovskites do not hinder the transport of holes from the 3D perovskite layer to the HTL 10 , 11 , while the higher conduction band minimum of the 2D perovskite than the 3D perovskite acts as an electron-blocking layer, effectively preventing the recombination of electrons in the perovskite and holes in the HTL for the 3D/2D and 3D/CLP/2D heterostructures 10 , 13 . This favourable band alignment contributes to the enhanced
V OC
of as-fabricated cells, and the selection of 4F-PEAI is discussed in Supplementary Note
4 . To avoid the instability issues associated with metal electrodes 36 , 61 , 62 , we prepared carbon electrodes based on the screen-printing technique (Supplementary Fig.
14 ) to fabricate PSCs with a device architecture of ITO/SnO 2 /3D/CLP/2D/spiro-OMeTAD/carbon. We optimized the concentration of the CLP solution and found that the CLP layer prepared with a concentration of 3 mg ml −1
delivered the optimal cell efficiency (Fig.
3d ). We fabricated cells using 3D perovskite, 3D/2D, 3D/CLP and 3D/CLP/2D heterostructures as the light-absorbing layers, and the distribution of efficiencies is presented in Fig.
3e , Supplementary Table
5
and Supplementary Fig.
15 . The cells based on 3D perovskite achieve an average efficiency of 18.83%. The average efficiencies of devices based on 3D/2D and 3D/CLP heterostructures are improved to 19.81% and 19.91%, respectively. The cells based on the 3D/CLP/2D heterostructure deliver an average efficiency of 20.29%. The efficiency improvement mainly results from the enhanced
V OC , which is attributed to the synergistic passivation effect of the CLP and 2D perovskite. Figure
3f
shows the representative
J – V
curves of the cells. For the champion 3D/CLP/2D cell, we achieve a high efficiency of 21.2% with a
V OC
of 1.13 V, a current density ( J SC ) of 24.00 mA cm −2
and a FF of 0.78 for carbon-electrode-based PSCs (Supplementary Table
6 ). The steady-state power output (SPO) efficiency of the cell reaches ~20.87% (Supplementary Fig.
16 ). The external quantum efficiency spectrum of the 3D/CLP/2D PSC shows an integrated short-circuit current density of 23.34 mA cm − 2
(Fig.
3g ), which is in agreement with the
J – V
scanning result. We further fabricated a PSM with six sub-cells in series, as shown in Fig.
3h
and Supplementary Fig.
17 . The champion PSM based on the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure with a carbon electrode and an aperture area of 17.1 cm 2
achieves a PCE of 19.6% with
V OC
of 6.73 V, short-circuit current of 66.2 mA and FF of 0.751. Furthermore, it exhibits SPO efficiency of 19.1% under a bias voltage of 5.5 V for 100 s (Fig.
3i ). Meanwhile, the PSM achieves a certified efficiency of 19.3% and SPO of 18.2% (Supplementary Fig.
18 ). Device stability To study operational stability, we monitored the cell performance under MPP tracking conditions and continuous one-sun illumination at 60 °C (Supplementary Fig.
19 ). The estimated
T 90
lifetime of the 3D/2D PSC is 560 h. The PSC based on the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure maintains ~92% of the initial efficiency after 1,000 hours under continuous illumination. According to time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) of these 1,000 h-aged cells, the diffusion of iodide ions from the perovskite layer to the spiro-OMeTAD layer is effectively suppressed in the 3D/CLP/2D PSC (Supplementary Fig.
20 ). Combined with the XPS depth profiling (Supplementary Fig.
21 ), we find that the CLP layer and 2D perovskite synergistically contribute to the suppressed diffusion of iodide. To eliminate the negative effect of spiro-OMeTAD on the cell stability and verify the stability of the perovskite heterostructures, we carry out four repairing cycles of the cell by re-depositing the spiro-OMeTAD layer. The cell maintains ~90% of the initial efficiency after 5,000 h continuous operation (Fig.
4a ). The cell performance recovery indicates that the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure is highly stable against light and heat stress. Furthermore, a more stable poly(3-hexylthiophene)-spiro-OMeTAD (P3HT-spiro-OMeTAD) (3:1 w/w) mixed HTL is adopted to replace the unstable spiro-OMeTAD 12 . The initial efficiencies of as-fabricated PSCs slightly reduce to 18.6% based on 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure and 18.0% based on 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure (Supplementary Fig.
22 ). For the long-term operational stability, the efficiency of the 3D/2D PSC decays to ~90% of the initial value after 672 h of continuous operation, while the 3D/CLP/2D PSC maintains 90% of its initial efficiency after continuous operation for 4,390 h at 60 °C (Fig.
4b ). Fig. 4: Long-term stability test. a , The operational stability of PSCs using spiro-OMeTAD as the HTL under continuous illumination in N 2

Full size image Conclusion In summary, we successfully suppress the ion diffusion between surface 2D and bulk 3D perovskites by introducing a highly cross-linked network polymer. A highly stable 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure is constructed and combined with a carbon electrode to fabricate PSCs with an efficiency of 21.2% and mini-PSMs with an efficiency of 19.6% (certified stabilized efficiency of 18.2%). After 4,390 hours of continuous operation under MPP tracking and one-sun illumination, the device retains 90% of its initial performance. Methods Materials All perovskite reagents including lead iodide (PbI 2 , 99.99%), formamidinium iodide (FAI, >99.5%), methylammonium bromide (MABr, >99.5%), lead bromide (PbBr 2 , 99.99%), methylammonium chloride (MACl, >99.5%), 4-fluorophenylethylammonium iodide (4F-PEAI, >99.5%), spiro-OMeTAD (99.5%) and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) were purchased from Xi’an p-OLED Corp. Dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.7%) and chlorobenzene (99.8%) were purchased from Acros. From Sigma–Aldrich, 4-tert-butylpyridine (96%), lithium bistrifluorosulfonyl imide (99.95%) and isopropanol (IPA, 99.99%) were obtained. The dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA, 98%), ethylene dimethacrylate (EDMA, 98%), octavinyloctasilasesquioxane (POSS, 95%) and 2,2’-Azobis(2-methylpropionitrile) (AIBN, 98%) were purchased from Aladdin. The SnO 2
colloid dispersion was purchased from Alfa Aesar (tin (IV) oxide, 15 wt% in H 2 O colloidal dispersion). Graphite and carbon black powder were purchased from Aladdin. Indium tin oxide (ITO) (transmission >95%) substrates were purchased from South China Science & Technology Company Limited. Other materials were purchased from Aladdin and all the materials were used as received unless otherwise specified. Synthesis of the additive in carbon paste 1.0 g of DMSA (5.5 mmol), 0.99 g of ethylene dimethacrylate (EDMA) (5 mmol), 79.1 mg of octavinyloctasilasesquioxane (POSS) (0.125 mmol) and 38 mg of 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone (2 wt% of reactants) were well dispersed in the tetrahydrofuran (THF) (20 ml) in a quartz flask. The mixture was irradiated using a 365 nm UV lamp (25 W) for 2 h at room temperature. After the reaction was complete,
n -hexane was added to obtain a solid crude product. The obtained product was dissolved in THF and precipitated in excess hexane again. Then, the solid was washed with deionized water and further dried under vacuum. Finally, 1.57 g of white additive powder was obtained. Preparation of the carbon electrode Six g graphite, 2 g carbon black powder, 1.76 g of above additive powder and 0.8 g polyacrylate were mixed in the 2-butoxyethanol/pentyl acetate/ethyl acetate (volume ratio of 5:3:2) mixed solvents and kept ball milling for 12 h to obtain the carbon paste. The pre-prepared carbon paste was coated onto a carbon cloth via a screen-printing process to obtain the carbon film. The carbon paste/carbon cloth-based electrode was peeled off and then soaked in ethanol while sonicating for 10 min to remove the residual solvent. Finally, the carbon electrode was taken out and dried at room temperature. Fabrication of perovskite solar cells and mini-modules ITO glass was patterned by laser etching (Universal Laser Systems, VLS2.30) with a femtosecond laser. Then the glass substrates were cleaned by sequential ultrasonication in a detergent solution, deionized water and anhydrous ethanol. The SnO 2
dispersion was spin coated on the substrates at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s and then annealed at 150 °C for 30 min. After that, a 1.4 M (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05
perovskite precursor solution containing of 0.5 M MACl was prepared in DMF/DMSO/GBL (v/v = 2:1:2). The perovskite precursor solution was spin coated on SnO 2
at 1,000 r.p.m. for 10 s and 5,000 r.p.m. for 20 s. The wet film was then immediately put into a sealed sample chamber connected to a home-built vacuum-pumping system and immediately exposed to low pressure (20 Pa) for 10 s. Subsequently, the perovskite film was put on a hotplate and annealed at 120 °C for 40 min to obtain the pristine 3D perovskite film. Next, 15 mM 4F-PEAI/IPA solution was spun on the above 3D perovskite at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s to prepare 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure. For the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite film, 3 mg EDMA, POSS (3 mol% of EDMA) and 2,2′-Azobis(2-methylpropionitrile) initiator (2 wt% of EDMA) were first dissolved in 1 ml of chlorobenzene and ethyl acetate mixed solution (v:v = 1:1) to prepare the CLP solution, and then spun on the above 3D perovskite at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. Then a 30 nm-thick layer of PbI 2
was evaporated at a rate of 0.3 Å s −1
onto the 3D/CLP bilayer film in a vacuum chamber. Subsequently, the same concentration of 4F-PEAI/IPA solution was spun on the above 3D/CLP/PbI 2
film at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min to prepare the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure. After cooling down to room temperature, a HTL (73 mg ml − 1
spiro-OMeTAD in chlorobenzene with 9.36 mg Li-TFSI salt in acetonitrile and 30 μl 4-tert-butylpyridine) was deposited on the perovskite film by spin coating at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. For the stability test, the P3HT-spiro-OMeTAD mixed HTL (54.75 mg P3HT and 18.25 mg spiro-OMeTAD with 4.68 mg Li-TFSI in acetonitrile and 15 μl 4-tert-butylpyridine) was deposited with the same spin-coating process. Finally, the pre-prepared carbon electrode was pressed onto the HTL under a pressure of 0.3 MPa at 60 °C for 15 s via a pneumatic hot press to complete the whole devices fabrication. For fabricating carbon-based modules, laser scribing was performed twice, before and after perovskite film deposition, to form P1 and P2 with 1,064 nm wavelength to complete the series interconnection between sub-cells in the module. Meanwhile, mechanical scribing was performed on the carbon electrode to obtain sub-electrode units insulated from each other before assembly. Finally, the electrode was pressed onto the HTL with the same process of small-area devices. Repairing of PSCs by re-depositing the HTL The degraded PSCs were first disassembled to obtain the free-standing carbon electrode and perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD semi-cell. The spiro-OMeTAD on the semi-cell was washed out with chlorobenzene, followed by the deposition of the new spiro-OMeTAD HTL. Finally, the above disassembled carbon electrode was reassembled on the semi-cell to complete the repair of degraded PSCs. Characterization The cross-sectional morphology of perovskite film was investigated by a field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi SU8010). The TRPL spectra were measured by a HORIBA Jobin–Yvon Fluorolog-III fluorimeter. The steady-state PL spectra were measured with a 405 nm wavelength excitation source and the PL emission was collected using an optical fibre coupled with an Ocean Optics spectrometer (‘Flame’) calibrated by the manufacturer. UV–vis absorption of perovskite films was measured by UV–vis spectrometer (lambda 750 S, PerkinElmer). Thermogravimetric analysis was carried out using a TA Instruments TGA 2050 thermogravimetric analyser. The XRD patterns were collected from X-ray diffractometer (D8 Advance). AFM-IR experiments were carried out using a commercial AFM-IR set-up (NanoIR3s, Bruker) that consists of an AFM microscope operating in contact mode and a Quantum Cascade Laser or QCL laser (MIRcat, Daylight Solutions Inc.) that was tunable from 2,350 cm −1
to ≈870 cm − 1
(from 4.25 μm to 11.49 μm). The
J – V
curves were measured using a solar simulator (Oriel 94023 A, 300 W) with a source meter (Keithley 2400) under 100 mW cm − 2
illumination (AM 1.5 G) with a scan rate of 100 mV s − 1
for solar cells and 500 mV s − 1
for modules. The small-area PSCs and large-area PSMs are measured using masks with an area of 0.16 cm 2
and 17.1 cm 2 , respectively. FTIR measurement The polymer monomers were first polymerized on the perovskite surface, and then the sample was cleaned with DMF solution and dried under vacuum to remove the perovskite material. The IR spectra were recorded with a VERTEX 70 Infrared Fourier transform microscope (Bruker Co.). XPS measurement XPS measurements were performed with a PHI VersaProbe II scanning XPS microprobe using a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray of 24.8 W power with a beam size of 100 µm. All peaks were calibrated using C 1 s
peak at 284.8 eV to correct charge shift of binding energies. PES measurement The PES measurements were performed on the Thermofisher ESCALAB Xi +
system. For reference, the XPS/UPS spectra energy positions were calibrated using a standard Au sample at BE of Au 4 f
7/2 = 84.0 eV and EF = 0 eV. The gas cluster ion beam sputtering parameters were set as 2,000 sizes at 4 keV mode with a 5 mm sputtering spot. XPS measurements were carried out using monochromated Al Kα source ( h ν  = 1,486.6 eV, where
h
is the Planck’s constant and
ν
is the photon frequency) with a pass energy of 20 eV. UPS measurements were performed using a He UV lamp (hν = 21.2 eV) with a pass energy of 1 eV. TOF-SIMS measurements Compositional depth profiling of perovskite films was carried out using a TOF-SIMS 5 system from IONTOF, operated in the spectral mode and using a 30 keV Bi 3+
primary ion beam with an ion current of 0.8 pA. For depth profiling, a 1 keV Cs +
sputter beam with a current of 28 nA was used to remove material layer by layer in interlaced mode, from a raster area of 300 μm × 300 μm. Mass spectrometry was performed on an area of 80 μm × 80 μm in the centre of the sputter crater. TA measurements Femtosecond laser pulses of 800 nm fundamental beam (5 kHz repetition rate, 35 fs pulse width) were produced using a Ti: Sapphire regenerative amplifier (Legend Duo, Coherent Inc.). Part of the fundamental beam was used to pump an optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS-Prime, Light Conversion) to serve as a narrow-band pump, while the other part was focused on a sapphire crystal to generate a white light supercontinuum probe (420–780 nm window with various optical filters).The pump wavelength was 400 nm under pump power of 3 μJ cm − 2 . Both the pump and probe pulses were directed into a commercial TA spectrometer (Helios, Ultrafast Systems). Delaying the probe pulse relative to the pump pulse provides a time window of up to 8 ns. The instrument response function was determined to be
∼ 200 fs by a routine cross-correlation procedure. All TA spectra were chirp corrected. Stability test For the stability tests of 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure, all samples were aged at 100 °C for 120 min under nitrogen atmosphere. The operational stability tests were carried out at the MPP for the encapsulated cells under one-sun illumination (100 mW cm − 2 ). The cells were tested in a chamber with an ambient atmosphere temperature of ~60 °C. The bias at the MPP was calculated and applied automatically. The cells were encapsulated in a N 2 -filled glovebox. A hot melt film was attached around the active area of the cells, and a glass slide was employed as the back sheet. Then the sample (cell/hot melt film/glass slide) was heated at 100 °C under a vacuum condition (<100 Pa) for 15 min by a commercial laminating system.

Abstract
Engineering two-/three-dimensional (2D/3D) perovskite solar cells is nowadays a popular strategy for efficient and stable devices. However, the exact function of the 2D/3D interface in controlling the long-term device behavior is still obscure. Here, we reveal a dynamical structural mutation of the 2D/3D interface: the small cations in the 3D cage move towards the 2D layer, which acts as an ion scavenger. If structurally stable, the 2D layer physically blocks the ion movement at the interface boosting the device stability. Otherwise, the 2D layer embeds them, dynamically self-transforming into a quasi-2D structure. The judicious choice of the 2D constituent is decisive in controlling the 2D/3D kinetics and improving the device lifetime, opening a new avenue for perovskite interface design.

Abstract Phenethylammonium (PEA + ) and butylammonium (BA + ) are widely used in three-dimensional (3D) perovskites to form two-dimensional perovskites at film surfaces and grain boundaries (GBs) for defect passivation and performance enhancement. Here we show that these cations are unstable with 3D formamidinium (FA + )-containing perovskites under high-temperature light soaking. PEA +
and BA +
are found to deprotonate to amines, which then react with FA +
to produce (phenethylamino)methaniminium (PEAMA + ) and (butylamino)methaniminium (BAMA + ), respectively, severely limiting device high-temperature photostability. Removing these cations greatly improves the photostability but compromises device efficiency by leaving non-fully passivated surfaces and GBs. Ammonium cations with a high acid dissociation constant (p K a ), including PEAMA +
(p K a  = 12.0) and BAMA +
(p K a  = 12.0), can replace PEA +
or BA +
for passivation and are stable with FA-based perovskites due to their resistance to further deprotonation. P–i–n structure solar cells with PEAMA +
additive maintained over 90% of their initial efficiency after light soaking at open circuit and 90 °C for 1,500 hours.

Main Two-dimensional (2D) perovskites have many interesting physical properties due to confinement effects that three-dimensional (3D) perovskites do not have, including exciton dynamics, spin dynamics and electron–phonon coupling 1 , 2 , 3 . Generally, 2D perovskites are considered to be much more stable than their 3D counterparts due to better moisture resistance of the hydrophobic organic cation 4 , 5 , larger energy barrier to ion migration 6 , 7
and increased tolerance to structural stress 8 , 9 . As a result, they have been widely applied in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to improve device efficiency and stability in various ways 4 , 10 , 11 , 12 . To overcome their poor carrier transport along the out-of-plane direction, a thin layer of 2D perovskite can be stacked on top of 3D perovskites via sequential deposition, which not only protects but also passivates the 3D perovskite surface 10 , 13 . They can also be incorporated into the grain boundaries (GBs) of 3D perovskites by adding the large organic cations into the precursor solution 14 . The much larger size of these organic cations causes them to be excluded form the 3D lattice to GBs which, in return, stablizes the GBs 5 , 15 . Additionally, high layer number ( n ) phase-pure quasi-2D perovskites have been developed to retain both the advantages of 3D perovskites—such as good charge transport and carrier lifetimes—and 2D perovskites, such as good stability, but neither their efficiency nor stability have reached the parity of other multi-dimensional perovskites 16 , 17 . The ability of 2D perovskites to enhance the efficiency of perovskite solar cells as additive or surface capping layer is very evident 4 , 12 , 13 , 18 , 19 , 20 . Among the numerous organic cations reported for 2D perovskites, phenethylammonium (PEA + ) and butylammonium (BA + ) are the most frequently used ammonium cations. Additionally, they have yielded many certified record power conversion efficiencies 12 , 13 , 21 . Encouraging shelf lifetime or even operational stability under light has also been frequently reported 22 , 23 . Nevertheless, almost all previous studies were conducted at relatively low temperatures. Because the operational lifetime of perovskite solar cells are reaching several thousand hours, higher temperatures are needed to accelerate the operational stability test, as demonstrated by several recent studies 22 , 23 . Some recent studies have shown poor stability of 2D:3D mixed perovskites and 2D/3D stacking structure at a high temperature of 85 °C, despite their promising stability at a lower temperature of 55 °C 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , which raises concerns about whether 2D:3D mixture structure or stacking structure is viable for long-term stability. The underlying mechanism of 2D:3D interfacial instability is still unclear. In this manuscript, we show that several commonly used ammonium cations, including PEA +
and BA + , are not stable with formamidinium (FA)-containing perovskites at 85 °C under illumination. We identify the easy deprotonation of PEA +
and BA +
cations as the underlying chemistry for the observed instability. New ammonium cations with high p K a , a parameter characterizing the resistance to deprotonation 28 , were used to replace PEA +
and BA +
cations. These devices based on formamidinium caesium (FACs) perovskites not only retain the high efficiencies but also dramatically enhanced the high-temperature photostability of perovskite solar cells. PEA +
induced worse high-temperature photostability PSCs with a structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine (PTAA)/FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 /C 60 /bathocuproine (BCP)/copper (Cu) (Supplementary Fig.
1a ) were fabricated via blade coating. A methylammonium (MA + )-free perovskite composition with a slight excess of FAI or caesium iodide (CsI) (0.25 mol%) was used to achieve high intrinsic stability 29 . Additionally, 0.25 mol% phenethylammonium chloride (PEACl) (relative to Pb 2+ ) and several other additives were added to the perovskite precursor solution to passivate defects at grain boundaries and film surfaces, which has been widely shown to improve the efficiency and stability of PSCs at relatively low testing temperatures 29 , 30 , 31 . The optimized PSCs yielded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.3% (Supplementary Fig.
1b ). Additionally, they showed remarkably good operational stability when soaked under open circuit condition beneath a white light emitting diode (LED) lamp at 1 sun intensity with a spectrum as shown in Supplementary Fig.
2a . The lamp also heated the devices to a temperature of 55 ± 5 °C. These devices maintained 90% of their initial efficiency after 3,200 hours on operational stability test, as shown in Fig.
1a . However, when the temperature was raised to 85 °C using the testing setup shown in Supplementary Fig.
2b
with the actual temperature of perovskites of 90 °C as shown in Supplementary Fig.
2d , the PSCs showed dramatically faster degradation. The efficiencies of the PSCs reduced to 90% of their initial value within ~150 hours (Fig.
1b ). Stability data from additional devices is displayed in Supplementary Fig.
3a–d . All photovoltaic parameters, including short-circuit current ( J SC ), open circuit voltage ( V OC ) and fill factor (FF), rapidly declined. Furthermore, when elevating the measurement temperature to 100 °C, the average
T 90
lifetime ( T 90 : the time it takes for device efficiency to drop to 90% of initial value) of the devices decreased to ~80 hours. The quick degradation of PSCs at high temperature and under light is not sensitive to encapsulation methods. The PSCs encapsulated with epoxy, polyisobutylene and atomic layer deposition SnO 2
all showed quick degradation (Supplementary Fig.
3e ). Fig. 1: Temperature-dependent photostability of FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 -perovskites with PEA +

The bars and whiskers show the mean EBIC current value and its standard deviation from five scans taken on each sample before and after ageing condition. Each plot represents the EBIC current from each scan. Source data Full size image The perovskite precursor solutions in this study had several additives to improve device efficiency, including phenethylammonium chloride (PEACl), formamidinium hypophosphite (FAH 2 PO 2 ), formamidinium chloride (FACl), Zinc chloride (ZnCl 2 ) and excess CsI. FAH 2 PO 2
and FACl were added to enlarge the grain size of perovskite films and passivate the non-radiative recombination defects 30 . PEACl was added to passivate the surface and grain boundaries by formation of 2D perovskite and suppress the halide ion migration 32 . ZnCl 2
was added to increase device efficiency by optimizing the perovskite morphology and decrease trap density 33 . Excess CsI was added to compensate iodide vacancies and suppress ion migration and defect generation during long-term illumination 29 . We speculated that some additive(s) may induce the quick degradation observed at high temperatures. To verify this, additives were removed one by one from the perovskite precursor solutions, PSCs were fabricated and then the same high-temperature photostability study was conducted (Supplementary Fig.
3g–h ). Results showed that the PSCs became much more stable after the PEACl additive was removed from the perovskite precursor solution. As shown in Fig.
1b
and Supplementary Fig.
3h , devices without PEACl retained 90% of their initial efficiency over 750 hours at 85 °C under 1 sun light illumination but started with a lower efficiency of ~20%. This suggests that PEA +
cations were the main reason for the poor photostability of FACs-perovskites at high temperatures; note that chloride was excluded using control studies where chloride was replaced by iodide (Supplementary Fig.
3i ). Additionally, to evaluate whether the location of phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) makes a difference, we removed PEAI in the precursor and instead applied PEAI as surface treatment to the perovskite films. A poor stability was again observed for these PSCs with PEAI surface treatment (Supplementary Fig.
3i ). This shows that the PEA +
cations cause poor high-temperature photostability, regardless of how PEA +
is introduced into the FACs-perovskites. The impact of PEA +
on FACs-perovskite intrinsic stability was manifested by the perovskite morphology and crystallinity evolution after light soaking at 85 °C for different durations. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results shown in Supplementary Fig.
4
revealed that the crystallinity of FACs-perovskite films with PEA +
quickly decreased after testing for 260 hours, while FACs-perovskite films without PEA +
experienced a slower degradation in crystallinity and retained the majority of their initial crystallinity over 860 hours of testing. This is evidenced by a slower decrease in XRD peak intensity and smaller changes in full-width half maximum values of the (001) plane peak. Additionally, cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that voids formed along grain boundaries during the stability measurement for films containing PEA +
(Fig.
1c ). This can be explained by the PEA +
ions that accumulated at the GBs, which damaged the 3D perovskites during the high-temperature light soaking testing. In contrast, devices without PEA +
did not develop voids even after testing for 860 hours (Fig.
1d ). Electron beam induced current (EBIC) measurements were conducted to further research the stability of PSCs with and without PEACl. For this measurement, devices with thinner electrodes (30 nm) were deposited so that an electron beam with an energy of 5–15 keV could penetrate through the electrode and electron transport layer (ETL), depositing its energy into the perovskite layer. Monte Carlo simulations of the electron trajectories indicate that 75% of the beam energy was deposited within the ETL and the first 10 s of nanometers (nms) of the perovskite (Supplementary Fig.
5 ). EBIC results in Fig.
1e
reveal that PEA +
incorporation results in a lower and less uniform current that further decreases over device ageing, in contrast to PSCs without PEA + . As can be seen in Fig.
1f , the pristine PSCs without PEA +
show an average EBIC current of ~3.0 nA. PSCs with PEACl show both a more heterogenous and lower average current collection of ~2.2 nA. Because the devices with PEACl have a larger photocurrent under 1 sun light, we interpret the smaller and more heterogenous EBIC by the faster degradation of the device with PEACl under electron beam. After the devices light soaked under 85 °C 1 sun for 250 hours, the mean current extraction from the device with PEACl decreased to ~1.1 nA. In contrast, the device without PEACl showed a modest increase in current to ~3.7 nA after the same ageing. The faster degradation of current collection during ageing indicates that the PEACl probably creates new mechanisms for the perovskite to degrade under operational stressors. The mechanism for PEA +
induced instability To further understand how PEA +
cations damage FACs-perovskites, we increased the amount of PEA +
cations in the FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3
films by directly mixing PEA 2 PbI 4
and FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3
solutions at molar ratios of 2:1 and 1:2 so that the 2D perovskites could be clearly observed in XRD. These mixed films, pure PEA 2 PbI 4
and FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3
were encapsulated by an inert poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) layer with >1 μm thickness and stressed under 1 sun illumination at 120 °C for a further accelerated photostability test. As shown by the XRD patterns in Fig.
2 , pure PEA 2 PbI 4
remained unchanged after testing for 260 hours while FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3
decomposed slightly to PbI 2 , showing the better intrinsic stability of PEA 2 PbI 4
than FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 . For the fresh PEA 2 PbI 4 :FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3
mixture films, only 2D phases with
n  = 1 and/or
n  = 2 showed up in the XRD patterns. After testing for 130 hours, the mixture films quickly degraded, and a new set of XRD peaks appears at 7.1° and 14.2° that do not belong to any known low-dimensional perovskites of PEA + . This suggests that a chemical reaction occurred between the PEA +
and FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3
during testing. Fig. 2: Phase changes in FACs-perovskite films with and without PEA +
under high-temperature light soaking. a – d , XRD of perovskite films that were prepared by mixing PEA 2 PbI 4

denotes new product phase with XRD peaks at 7.1° and 14.2°. Full size image It has been established that amines with lone pairs of electrons can easily attack the electrophilic imine bond in FA +
cations, even at room temperature 34 , 35 . We thus hypothesize that PEA +
and FA +
ions react via deprotonation of PEA +
to PEA 0
followed by a quick condensation reaction between PEA 0
and FA +
to form (phenethylamino)methaniminium (PEAMA + ), as shown by the scheme in Fig.
3a . To provide further evidence for this, we verified that the same reaction product could be produced from the reactions of (1) PEA 0
with FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3
and (2) PEAI with FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 . In this study, both PEAI and PEA 0
were spun onto FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3
films, followed by annealing at 120 °C for 0, 130 and 260 hours under 1 sun illumination. The PEAI-treated samples showed the formation of the PEA + -based 2D perovskites with
n  = 1 and
n  = 2 in the fresh films. These PEA + -based 2D perovskites transferred from lower
n
2D phases to a higher
n
2D phase ( n  = 3) after annealing at 120 °C for 130 hours, as shown in Fig.
2e , indicating loss of PEA +
in the films. Meanwhile, the XRD peak at 7.1° emerged. This new material was denoted as PEAMA product hereinafter and could be a lead iodide octahedral-based low-dimensional perovskite. This result resembles that of directly mixing PEAI with FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 , indicating that the PEA + -based 2D perovskites reacted with FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 . The same PEAMA product was observed from the reaction of PEA 0
with FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3
as shown by the 7.1° peak in the XRD pattern in Fig.
2f . This indicates the reaction of PEAI with FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3
goes through a deprotonation process to generate PEA 0 . Fig. 3: Chemical reactions in PEA + /FACsPbI 3

d , Photograph and crystal structure of PEAMA-FAI 3
co-crystal. Scale bar: 10 mm. Source data Full size image To understand why PEA +
easily deprotonates at high temperature, we examined its acid dissociation constant (p K a ), which represents a cation’s deprotonation capacity: $$\mathrm{pKa}\left(\mathrm{A}^{+}\right)={-\log }_{10}\frac{\left[\mathrm{A}^{0}\right]\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{A}^{+}\right]}\,$$ in which [A 0 ], [H + ], [A + ] represent the concentrations of A 0 , H +
and A + , respectively. The lower the p K a
of a cation, the greater its ability to deprotonate. p K a
is also temperature dependent based on Van’t Hoff equation 36 : $$\frac{\mathrm{dln}\left(\mathrm{Ka}\right)}{\mathrm{d}T}=\frac{\Delta H}{R{T}^{2}}$$ Because the acid dissociation is an endothermic reaction, the reaction enthalpy change ∆ H
is positive.
R
and
T
indicate the ideal gas constant and temperature, respectively. Thus p K a
increases with temperature, and deprotonation accelerates at higher temperatures. Figure
3b
shows the p K a
values of common A-site cations. p K a
of MA + , ethylammonium (EA + ), dimethylammonium (DMA + ) and BA +
have similar values between 10.6 and 10.8 (ref.
37 ), which are much smaller than those of FA +
(11.5–13) and guanidinium (GA + ) (13.6) (refs.
38 , 39 , 40 ). The chemical structures of these cations are shown in Fig.
3c . FA +
and GA +
differ from other ammonium cations by their conjugated structure with better stabilized electrons, which results in more stable interaction with the proton and thus makes deprotonation more difficult. Among all these cations, PEA +
has the smallest p K a
of 9.8 (ref.
38 ), explaining its quick deprotonation to PEA 0
and the resultant device degradation under high-temperature photostability study. It is noted that BA + , the other most widely used cation for 2D perovskites in perovskite solar cells, also has a small p K a
of 10.8. We thus followed the same process to evaluate the protonation and chemical reaction of BA +
with FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 . As shown in the XRD patterns in Supplementary Fig.
6 , the reactions of BAI or BA 2 PbI 4
and FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3
were also observed under high-temperature photostability tests, regardless of whether BAI was mixed directly into or deposited onto the surface of FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 . Similarly, the reaction generated a new phase with XRD peaks at 7.9° and 15.7°, resembling the reaction of BA 0
with FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 . The p K a
table also predicts that GA +
cations should be more stable with FA + . To verify this, we introduced 0.2 mol% GAI in PSCs and conducted high-temperature photostability measurements. As illustrated in Supplementary Fig.
7 , the addition of GAI did not accelerate the degradation, as evidenced by the retention of 90% of the initial efficiency after a light soaking stability test at 85 °C for 600 hours, in striking contrast to PEA + . These results suggest that p K a
is a reliable parameter for evaluating the high-temperature photostability of various ammonium cations with FA + . However, oversized GA +
incorporation into FACs-perovskites may induce local strain and potentially trigger degradation 41 ; therefore, new cations are still needed. The rapid degradation of FACsPbI 3
with PEA +
can be explained by the generated ammonia (NH 3 ) by the reaction of PEA 0
and FA + . NH 3
has a strong coordination with FACsPbI 3
and can dissolve it 34 , which can accelerate the decomposition of FACsPbI 3
into yellow phases. It also explains the observed void formation at the GBs in the devices with PEA +
(Fig.
1c ), considering that PEA +
cations are generally excluded to GBs during the crystallization process. The reaction of amines (including PEA 0 ) with FA +
in solution has been reported to be as fast as seconds at room temperature 34 , 42 , which was also confirmed in this study. Thus we can reasonably infer that the reaction rate between PEA +
and FA +
ions is limited by the PEA +
deprotonation process. Because light also enhances the mobility of proton, light should also accelerate the deprotonation of PEA +
in the photostability test. Passivation additives with high p K
a
Although completely removing PEA +
ions from the precursor solution improves the high-temperature photostability of the devices, it also reduces the device efficiency because of the exposed unpassivated film surfaces and GBs. A passivator is still needed to enhance the device efficiency. The passivator needs to meet three criteria: (1) it should have a suitable terminal size to fit into A-site vacancy at the perovskite surfaces and GBs; (2) it should have a high p K a
to resist deprotonation; (3) it should not react with FA +
itself. Fortunately, we found that the reaction product of PEA 0
and FA + , that is, PEAMA + , perfectly meets these criteria. It terminates with an amidinium group with the same size as FA + , it keeps delocalized electron structure of FA + , making it difficult to deprotonate, and its lack of deprotonation prevents further reactions with FA + . We calculated the p K a
of PEAMA +
to be 12.0, which is higher than the PEA +
benchmark. To better understand this cation, we synthesized PEAMAI by the reaction of PEA 0
with FAI, generating white powders. The single crystals of this salt can be formed by the recrystallization process, with a photograph of the crystal shown in Fig.
3d . The crystal structure obtained from single-crystal XRD confirmed the crystal is PEAMAI co-crystallized with two FAI (Supplementary Table
1 ). The bond lengths of C1–N1 and C1–N2 in PEAMAI are 1.30 Å, which is same as in FAI, indicating the resonance stabilization as we expected (Supplementary Table
2 ). The
1 H,
13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in Supplementary Figs.
8
and
9
confirmed the chemical structure of the obtained salt. The BAMAI was synthesized by the reaction of BA 0
and FAI confirmed by the
1 H,
13 C NMR in Supplementary Figs.
10
and
11 . The BAMA +
showed a similar p K a
value of 12.0 with PEAMA + . In addition, the synthesized co-crystal was mixed with PbI 2
in dimethylformamide (DMF) to fabricate films by spin coating. The XRD pattern in Supplementary Fig.
12
verified that PEAMAI-FAI reacted with PbI 2
to form a low-dimensional perovskite phase with XRD peaks at 7.1° and 14.2°, and BAMAI-FAI reacted with PbI 2
to form a low-dimensional perovskite phase with XRD peaks at 7.9° and 15.7°. To evaluate if PEAMAI is capable of passivating FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 , we used PEAMAI as a surface treatment for FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 . Different from using PEAMAI as additive, using PEAMAI as a surface treatment avoids a perovskite morphology change as shown by the SEM included in Supplementary Fig.
13 . The optimized surface treatment using PEAMAI resulted in a 57% increase of steady-state photoluminescence (PL) intensity, accompanied by a small blue shift of the PL peak (Fig.
4a ). Furthermore, the carrier lifetime increased from 390 ns to 496 ns (Fig.
4b ), confirming that PEAMAI passivates traps on the perovskite surface. To passivate perovskite GBs, we added 0.2 mol% PEAMAI as an additive in the perovskite precursor solution. The samples with and without PEAMAI are referred to as PEAMA + device and control device. We blade coated perovskite films with or without PEAMA +
on glass substrates and checked material morphology and passivation effect. Adding PEAMAI increased the steady-state PL intensity by 56% (Fig.
4c ) and increased the carrier lifetime from 384 ns to 497 ns (Fig.
4d ), indicating a reduced density of deep traps. Direct defect density measurement by thermal admittance spectroscopy shows that the trap density of states (tDOS) in PEAMA + devices is much lower within the trap band III (Fig.
4f ). A previous study indicates that this trap band is caused by the amorphous phase in the perovskite material 43 . Therefore, it appears the PEAMAI additive does change the crystallization process and slightly changes the morphology of perovskite film. This is consistent with PEAMA + films showing better crystallinity with stronger and sharper XRD peaks (Fig.
4e ). Fig. 4: Passivation of PEAMA +

devices under continuous AM 1.5 G illumination with laser pulse perpetuation. TPV curves were fitted by bi-exponential decay function. Full size image We estimated the mobile ion concentration in these devices by applying a 1.5 V forward bias for about 30 s to perturb the ion distribution and then measuring the current induced by the back diffusion of ions at zero bias. The measurements were performed in the dark. As shown in Fig.
4g , the mobile ions in the control devices required a much longer time (~5 s) to reach the steady state compared to the mobile ions in the PEAMA + -devices (~1 s). Additionally, the mobile ion concentration in the PEAMA + devices is three times smaller than the control devices, again indicating that PEAMAI additive improved the crystallinity of FACs-perovskites. The transient photovoltage (TPV) was measured in Fig.
4h . Devices without and with PEAMA +
show
V OC
of 1.06 V and 1.15 V under AM 1.5 G illumination and carrier recombination lifetimes of 350 ns and 570 ns, respectively. They are very close to the measured TRPL lifetime in the films, which indicates the charge transport layers do not introduce additional non-radiative recombination channels and confirms the reduced non-radiative recombination by the PEAMAI additive. Device efficiency and high-temperature photostability The impact of PEAMA +
on the performance of FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3
PSCs was investigated. Figure
5a
shows typical current density ( J )–voltage ( V ) curves of PSCs with and without PEAMA +
under both forward and reverse scans. The control PSCs had a PCE of 21.2% with a
J SC
of 24.7 mA cm −2 , a
V OC
of 1.07 V and a fill factor (FF) of 80.2%. PEAMA + -PSCs had a PCE of 24.1% with a J SC
of 25.8 mA cm −2 , a V OC
of 1.14 V, and a FF of 82.1%. The statistical distributions of the
V OC ,
J SC , FF and PCE are shown in Fig.
5b . The steady-state PCEs of the devices with and without PEAMA +
under AM 1.5 illumination are 20.9% and 23.8%, respectively (Fig.
5c ). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices are shown in Fig.
5d . PEAMA +
primarily increased the EQE in the long wavelength range, consistent with a longer carrier diffusion length due to reduced non-radiative charge recombination. The calculated
J SC
from EQE agrees well with the measured
J SC . Figure

shows the PCE of unencapsulated control devices and PEAMA +
devices as a function of measurement duration under 85 °C 1 sun illumination under

condition in N 2 . Stability data for each sample are listed in Supplementary Fig.
14a,b . The devices maintained 90% of the initial efficiency after ~800 hours in the absence of ammonium cations in the perovskites, while the devices with PEAMA +
maintained 90% of the initial efficiency after ~1,500 hours. The
J – V
curves of the PSCs with PEAMA +
after operational measurement for different durations were exhibited in Supplementary Fig.
14c . Furthermore, the high-temperature light stability of PEAMA +
devices was also evaluated at 100 °C under 1 sun illumination. As illustrated in Supplementary Fig.
14d,e , the average
T 90
of PEAMA +
devices was approximately 500 h, notably surpassing that of the control devices. The improved high-temperature stability of PSCs is attributed to the increased crystallinity and passivation induced by PEAMA +
in perovskite films. Supplementary Fig.
14f,g
displayed the cross-sectional SEM images and XRD patterns of PSCs before and after 1,400 hours of 1 sun illumination at 85 °C and the
V OC
condition. The cross-sectional SEM images of the stressed PSCs showed no voids, in striking contrast to the PEA +
containing FACs-perovskite devices, which showed voids along the GBs. It demonstrates the excellent high-temperature photostability of PEAMA +
with FACs-perovskites. The XRD patterns revealed that the PEAMA + devices had a relatively slower crystallinity degradation compared to PSCs with PEA +
after the initial crystallization process induced by heat. Fig. 5: Device performance. a ,

and BA +
for 2D perovskites are unstable in FA + -containing perovskites when the films or devices were subject to high-temperature light soaking. The PEA +
and BA +
deprotonate to amines, which further react quickly with FA +
to produce PEAMA +
and BAMA + , respectively. This process also generates ammonia, which causes damage to perovskite interfaces and grain boundaries, severely limiting the high-temperature photostability of perovskite solar cells. Removing PEA +
or BA +
cations from precursors or using ammonium cations with high p K a , including PEAMA +
and BAMA +
can improve the high-temperature photostability due to the difficulty of deprotonation. Methods Materials FAI, formamidinium chloride (FACl), zinc chloride (ZnCl 2 ) and phenylethylammonium chloride (PEACl) were purchased from GreatCell Solar and used without further purification. Lead iodide (PbI 2 , 99.99%) was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry. 2-Mercaptoethanol (2-ME), dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), toluene (TL), isopropanol (IPA), ethanol (EtOH), ethyl acetate (EtOAc), caesium iodide (CsI; 99.999%), PTAA (average Mn 7,000–10,000), BCP ( > 96%), deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO- d 6 ) and phenylethylamine (>99.5%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. C60 ( > 99.55%) was purchased from Nano-C. Formamidinium hypophosphite (FAH 2 PO 2 ) was synthesized via a method that was based on and modified from a previously published method 30 . Copper (Cu) pellets were purchased from Kurt J. Lesker Company. Synthesis of PEAMAI A colourless solution of 7.74 g (45 mmol) FAI in 50 ml absolute ethanol (EtOH) was stirred with an ice bath and added dropwise into a solution of 0.5 ml (4.5 mmol) phenylethylamine in 50 ml absolute ethanol. After the addition finished, the reaction was stirring for another 2 h and then worked up by evaporating the solvent. The crude product was washed out by 30 ml ethyl acetate two times to remove excess FAI. The eluate was concentrated by rotary evaporation resulting in light yellow oil. Recrystallization from 30 ml EtOAc/EtOH/IPA under −18 °C yielded 0.879 g (1.4 mmol, 31.1%) white solid, which is a co-crystal of PEAMAI and 2 FAI. The co-crystals are mixture of trans- and cis-PEAMAI isomers determined by NMR spectra (Supplementary Fig.
8 ).

101.1074 found 101.1078. Preparation of PSCs The ITO glass was cleaned with acetone and isopropanol using ultrasonic cleaning for 15 minutes, followed by 15 minutes of ultraviolet ozone treatment before blade coating the hole transport layer (HTL) layer using 2.2 mg ml −1
PTAA in toluene with a 200 μm blade gap. To fabricate high-quality FACsPbI 3
films with PEACl, a mixture of 0.9 M FAPbI 3
(in 2-ME solution) and 0.1 M CsPbI3 (in DMSO solution) was prepared with a molar percentage of DMSO to Pb around 56% in precursor solutions. 2.5% FACl, 1.0% FAH 2 PO 2 , 0.25% PEACl, 0.5% ZnCl 2
and 0.25% CsI were added to the perovskite precursor solution. The FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3
films were blade coated on PTAA/ITO substrates at room temperature with a gap of 300 μm and N 2
blowing at 20 pound per square inch (psi), followed by annealing at 150 °C for 3 min to obtain the perovskite phase. The humidity and temperature of the air is ~30% and 21 °C, respectively. We removed each of the additives from the perovskite precursor to fabricate perovskite solar cells and evaluated their effect on the high-temperature photostability of PSCs. For instance, in FACsPbI 3
films without PEACl, a mixture of 0.9 M FAPbI 3
(in 2-ME solution) and 0.1 M CsPbI 3
(in DMSO solution) was used with a molar percentage of DMSO to Pb around 56% in precursor solutions. To produce high-quality perovskite films, the perovskite precursor solution was supplemented with 2.5% FACl, 1.0% FAH 2 PO 2 , 0.5% ZnCl 2
and 0.25% CsI, too. In addition, we replaced PEACl with PEAI in the precursor solution, adding 0.25% PEAI while retaining the other additives, including 2.5% FACl, 1.0% FAH 2 PO 2 , 0.5% ZnCl 2
and 0.25% CsI in the perovskite precursor solution. To check PEAI surface treatment effect on stability of PSCs at high-temperature light soaking condition, 1 mg ml −1
PEAI solution was prepared in IPA. The solution was spin coated onto perovskite films without PEACl at 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. To check the passivation effect of PEAMAI, 1 mg ml −1
PEAMAI solution was prepared in IPA. The solution was spin coated onto perovskite films without PEACl at 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. For FACsPbI 3
films with PEAMAI, 0.2% PEAMAI was added to the FACs-perovskite solution along with 2.5% FACl, 1.0% FAH 2 PO 2 , 0.5% ZnCl 2
and 0.25% CsI in the perovskite precursor solution. To prepare FACsPbI 3
with PEAMAI, we used 0.9 M FA 0.99 PbI 3
(in 2-ME solution) and 0.1 M CsPbI 3
(in DMSO solution), as the synthesized PEAMAI lattice contains FAI. The precursor solution was blade coated with a 300 μm blade gap and N 2
blowing at 20 psi, followed by immediate annealing at 150 °C for 3 minutes. To assemble PSCs, we first evaporated 30 nm of C 60
onto the perovskite films at a vacuum pressure of 10 −6  Pa. We then evaporated 6 nm of BCP onto the sample substrates, which had been heated to approximately 80 °C before BCP deposition. Finally, we thermally evaporated Cu electrodes with 150 nm thickness. The area of shadow masks used in this work is 0.08 cm 2 . PEA +
and FA +
mixed perovskite film fabrication: for high-temperature photostability check of PEA + , we prepared a 1 M PEA 2 PbI 4
precursor solution by mixing 2 M PEAI and 1 M PbI 2
in 1 ml DMF solution, while a 1 M FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3
solution was prepared by mixing 0.9 M FAI, 0.1 M CsI and 1 M PbI 2
in 1 ml DMF solution. Then we mixed the PEA 2 PbI 4
and FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3
solutions at a ratio of 1:0, 2:1, 1:2 and 0:1. Subsequently, 40 μl perovskite solution was spin coated onto glass substrates at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s in a glovebox, followed by the addition of 130 μl TL after ~12 s and annealing at 120 °C for 15 minutes. The 3D films were prepared by spin coating FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3
solution onto glass substrates at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s in a glovebox, followed by the addition of 130 μl TL as antisolvent after ~6 s and annealing at 150 °C for 15 minutes. A PMMA solution in TL was dropped onto the prepared films and annealed at 100 °C for 1 minute to form a PMMA layer with a thickness >1 μm to cover on perovskite films. The BA +
and FA +
mixed perovskite films were fabricated by mixing 1 M BA 2 PbI 4
precursor solution and 1 M FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3
using same way to the PEA +
and FA +
mixed perovskite film fabrication. XRD Powder XRD patterns were measured by a Rigaku Smart Lab diffractometer with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The scan rate was 10° min −1
at the step-scan size of 0.01°. Single-crystal XRD was performed on a Bruker D8 VENTURE diffractometer with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å). The diffraction data were handled by Olex2 software 44 , and the crystal structures were solved and refined by the ShelXT 45
and ShelXL 46
programmes, respectively. Thermal ellipsoid models were rendered by VESTA 47
or Ortep3 48 . PEAMAI-FAI-PbI 2
and BAMAI-FAI-PbI 2
films in Supplementary Fig.
12
were prepared by spin coating 1 M PEAMAI-FAI (or BAMAI-FAI) and PbI 2
with equal molar ratio in DMF solution at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. SEM The morphology of the samples was measured by a Hitachi-4700 microscope with an electron beam accelerated at 10 kV. The surface of the samples was coated with Au to prevent charging during the measurement. Photocurrent measurement J – V
curves were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under the simulated AM 1.5 G 1 sun illumination (100 mW cm −2 ) using a solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3 A class AAA) equipped with 450 W Xenon lamp (Newport 6280NS). The light intensity was calibrated using a Si solar cell with a KG-5 filter. The active area of devices is 0.08 cm 2 , defined by the size of the Cu electrode. The devices were measured at ambient air with humidity of 30–60% without temperature control. The scan rate during measurement was set to 50 mV s −1 . Steady-state PCE was conducted by measuring stabilized photocurrent density under a constant bias voltage at maximum power point derived from
J – V
curves. An anti-refection coating was used during measurement. EBIC EBIC was performed using a Mighty EBIC 2.0 Controller from Ephemeron Labs Inc. (currently Ephemeral Devices) and a FEMTO DLPCA-200 pre-amplifier. EBIC and a SEM image were collected concurrently in an FEI Scios DualBeam FIB/SEM from Thermo Fisher Scientific. In this study, EBIC was measured at a short-circuit condition. To collect an EBIC scan, first the electron beam was focused on the edge of the device area at low magnification, then moved along the edge to a fresh area to focus on a higher magnification. Once the desired magnification was achieved, the beam was moved towards the centre of the device in one direction to take EBIC measurements on unscanned fresh areas. Five EBIC scans in fresh regions were collected on each active device area. Monte Carlo simulation Monte Carlo simulations of the electron beam interaction volume were performed using Monte Carlo simulation of electron trajectory in solids (CASINO) open-source software to estimate the beam spot size and penetration depth. In CASINO, each electron trajectory is approximated as a zigzag trajectory as a result of elastic and inelastic collision of the electron with the atoms in the material 49 . For this study, 1,600 electron trajectories were simulated for each run. The incident beam radius is set to 10 nm. EQE A Newport QE measurement kit was used to measure the EQE of PSCs. A monochromatic light beam from a Xenon Arc lamp coupled with a Bruker Vertex 80 v Fourier Transform Interferometer was incident and focused onto the devices. Then, the photocurrent was obtained through a Stanford Research SR570 current pre-amplifier. EQE of devices was calibrated by a Newport reference silicon solar cell with a known EQE. TPV TPV decays were measured under 1 sun illumination with a 337 nm laser pulse (SRS NL 100 Nitrogen Laser, pulse duration of less than 3.5 ns) to add a small perturbation to the background illumination. The voltage of the device was measured with a digital oscilloscope (DOS-X 3104 A) with an input impedance set to 1 MΩ. PL PL spectra were collected with a Horiba iHR320 Spectrometer. A 532 nm green laser (Laserglow Technologies) with an intensity of 100 mW cm −2
was used as the excitation source. TRPL TRPL measurement was conducted on a DeltaFlex modular fluorescence lifetime system from Horiba Scientific with a pulsed laser source at 406 nm (Horiba NanoLED 402-LH; pulse width below 200 ps, 20 pJ per pulse, ~1 mm 2
spot size) with a repetition rate of 0.3125 MHz. The signal was recorded using time-corrected single photon counting (TCSPC). The fluence of excitation light was 200 nJ m − 2 . tDOS tDOS measurement was performed by the thermal admittance spectroscopy measurement using an LCR meter (Agilent E4980A). The tDOS was derived from the frequency-dependent capacitance and voltage-dependent capacitance based on the equation:
\({N}_\mathrm{T}\left({E}_{\omega }\right)\) \(={-}\frac{1}{{qkT}}\frac{\omega{\mathrm{d}C}}{\mathrm{d}\omega }\frac{{V}_{\mathrm{bi}}}{W}\) , where
q ,

C
are elementary charge, Boltzmann’s constant, temperature, angular frequency and specific capacitance, respectively.
W
and

are the depletion width and build-in potential, respectively. Mobile ion concentration measurement The measurement of mobile ion concentration was conducted using Keithley 4200A-SCS system. We estimated the mobile ion concentration in these devices by applying 1.5 V forward bias for about 30 s to perturb the ion distribution and then measuring current induced by the back diffusion of ions that were quickly zero biased to allow ions to diffuse back to steady state. The transient current induced by ion back diffusion was recorded and the measurements were performed with devices in the dark. The mobile ion concentration was obtained from the integrated transient current over time divided by the perovskite volume and the elementary charge. NMR and HRMS 1 H and
13 C NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker Neo 400 MHz spectrometer. Clear and transparent solutions of PEAMAI-FAI 3
crystal or BAMAI-FAI mixture powder that dissolved in DMSO- d 6
were measured following the standard procedure for
1 H and
13 C. Chemical shifts were referenced to tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. HRMS was measured by a Q Exactive HF-X (ThermoFisher) mass spectrometer. p K

were calculated using MarvinSketch software ( https://www.chemaxon.com ). Stability characterization Photostability measurement was conducted at 55 ± 5 °C; before conducting photostability measurements, the PSCs were encapsulated by epoxy and glass. The encapsulated PSCs were then exposed to white LED irradiation at an intensity of 1 sun, which was calibrated using a Si reference solar cell with a KG-5 filter. The spectral distribution of the lamp used was depicted in Supplementary Fig.
2a . The PSCs were measured under
V oc
conditions without temperature controlling. Due to the light exposure, the sample temperature rose to 50–60 °C. High-temperature photostability measurement: to prevent the release of toxic gas into the air due to the instability of the epoxy under high temperature and light, the PSCs were not encapsulated during high temperature photostability measurements. Instead, the measurements were conducted in an N 2
glovebox to maintain an inert atmosphere. The arrangement used for the high-temperature photostability measurement is illustrated in Supplementary Fig.
2b , wherein unencapsulated PSCs were placed on a hot plate set at a temperature of 85 °C or 100 °C. The PSCs were then exposed to white LED irradiation from above. The uniformity of the hot plate, as displayed in Supplementary Fig.
2c , was verified using a thermometer. In addition, the actual temperatures of perovskite under different set temperatures and 1 sun LED light were monitored by sticking a temperature sensor directly onto the Cu electrode layer. As shown in Supplementary Fig.
2d , the actual temperature of perovskites was about 90 °C when the set hot plate temperature was 85 °C. After continuous illumination at high temperature for 48 or 72 hours, unencapsulated devices were taken out from the N 2
glovebox for the
J – V
measurement. The
J – V
measurement was conducted in air with humidity of 30–60% without temperature control. An anti-refection coating was used during measurement. Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the

Abstract Planar structures for halide perovskite solar cells have recently garnered attention, due to their simple and low-temperature device fabrication processing. Unfortunately, planar structures typically show
I–V
hysteresis and lower stable device efficiency compared with mesoporous structures, especially for TiO 2 -based n-i-p devices. SnO 2 , which has a deeper conduction band and higher electron mobility compared with traditional TiO 2 , could enhance charge transfer from perovskite to electron transport layers, and reduce charge accumulation at the interface. Here we report low-temperature solution-processed SnO 2
nanoparticles as an efficient electron transport layer for perovskite solar cells. Our SnO 2 -based devices are almost free of hysteresis, which we propose is due to the enhancement of electron extraction. By introducing a PbI 2
passivation phase in the perovskite layer, we obtain a 19.9 ± 0.6% certified efficiency. The devices can be easily processed under low temperature (150  ∘ C), offering an efficient method for the large-scale production of perovskite solar cells.

Perovskite solar cells have attracted great attention in recent years, as their efficiency has risen from 3.8% to 22.1% via film crystal growth control, interface and device engineering 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . Up to now, TiO 2
mesoporous structures were commonly the most successful at delivering high efficiency and stable power output for perovskite solar cells 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . However, one disadvantage of the mesoporous structure is the high-temperature (>450  ∘ C) sintering required for the TiO 2
mesoporous layer, which is a barrier to low cost and stretchable device fabrication 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . Further interest in perovskite solar cells developed after it was realized that lead halide perovskites have charge carrier diffusion lengths on the micrometre scale and possess ambipolar properties 6 , 7 . Therefore, it is possible to remove the high-temperature sintered mesoporous layer to make a simple planar-structure solar cell, in which all of the layers can be processed at low temperature 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 . Planar devices are typically divided into either n-i-p (regular) or p-i-n (inverted) structures, depending on the bottom transporting layer 12 . The p-i-n inverted planar structure usually shows negligible hysteresis when using fullerene as the top electron transport layer 12 . However, it exhibits lower efficiency due to inferior perovskite crystallinity and imperfect interfacial band alignment 11 , 12 . For regular n-i-p planar structures using a TiO 2
condensed layer as the electron transport layer, the device could show high performance under reverse scan ( V OC
to
J SC
scan), whereas the forward
I–V
scan usually showed much lower efficiency ( J SC
to
V OC
scan) 4 , 9 , which led to difficulty in obtaining a reliable power conversion efficiency 4 , 9 . Further results indicated that charge accumulation induced by ion migration in the perovskite layer could be the main cause of hysteresis 13 , 14 , 15 . It was also found that the electronic contact between perovskite and electron transport layers (ETLs) could significantly affect the behaviour of the hysteresis 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20
(generally, hole transport layers do not affect hysteresis, because the commonly used hole transport layer, Spiro-OMeTAD, can form good electronic contact with perovskite 6 ). When the electronic contact is imperfect, the charge accumulation will become worse and aggravate the hysteresis. However, if the electronic contact is perfect and the accumulated charges can be easily extracted, the hysteresis can be alleviated or fully eliminated 17 , 20 . For example, either in the regular or the inverted planar structure, on introducing a fullerene layer with a strong electron extraction ability, the devices showed stable output with reduced hysteresis 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 . However, fullerene is expensive, as well as unstable for practical applications 12 . Inorganic metal oxides such as SnO 2
have a bandgap above 3.6 eV, and a deeper conduction band than TiO 2 . Thus, in principle they should facilitate more efficient electron transfer 21 . Furthermore, bulk SnO 2
has a mobility of up to 240 cm 2 /(V · s), which is 100 times that of TiO 2 , making it conceptually a more likely candidate for use in high-performance electronic devices 21 . Previously, SnO 2
has been used as an electron transport layer in organic solar cells or dye-sensitized solar cells 21 , 22 . Recently, it was also used in perovskite solar cells in order to increase the efficiency and to reduce the hysteresis 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 . During the final preparation of this Article, ref. 28 was published, reporting planar perovskite solar cells with an average PCE around 18.5% and a mild hysteresis. Here, we develop a regular n-i-p planar structure of perovskite solar cells with solution-processed SnO 2
nanoparticles as the electron transport layer. The devices show a certified efficiency close to 20%, almost free of hysteresis. Given the SnO 2
layer’s deep conduction band and high electron mobility, we ascribe the elimination of the
I–V
hysteresis to the enhanced electron extraction caused by the reduction of the energy barrier at the perovskite/ETL interface. Furthermore, an excess PbI 2
phase was introduced to passivate the traps in perovskite (FAPbI 3 ) 0.97 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.03
and deliver high device performance. Characterization of nanoparticles and perovskite layer Transmission electron microscopy ( Fig. 1a ) showed the SnO 2
particles we used are very uniform, with particle sizes around 3–4 nm. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy results ( Fig. 1b ) indicated the SnO 2
nanoparticles are highly crystallized, which is good for reducing the number of defect traps in SnO 2 , and should also be beneficial for charge transfer when using it as a charge transport layer. Electron diffraction circles from the (110), (101) and (211) crystal planes of SnO 2
were observed ( Fig. 1c ), indicating that the SnO 2
nanoparticles are polycrystalline. X-ray diffraction ( Fig. 1d ) results further confirmed this conclusion. All X-ray diffraction peaks for SnO 2
( Fig. 1d ) are indexable to the tetragonal SnO 2
structure (space group
P 42/ mnm ,
a
= 0.4738 and
c
= 0.3187 nm), indicating the formation of pure SnO 2
crystals 28 . When spin coating SnO 2
nanoparticles solution onto glass/ITO substrate, it can form a dense, pinhole-free film ( Fig. 1e ), and the film quality is much better than that of the conventionally used TiO 2
nanoparticles film ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). In addition, we found that the SnO 2
films formed showed good transparency, with transmission values greater than 95% in the visible region ( Fig. 1f ), with minimized optical loss in the SnO 2
layer. Figure 1: Properties of SnO 2

films deposited on a glass substrate. Full size image We have characterized the electronic states and band structures of SnO 2
and perovskite layers with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). The Sn 3 d
core-level spectrum of SnO 2
nanoparticles is shown in
Supplementary Fig. 2 . The peaks at binding energies of 486.9 eV and 495.3 eV correspond to Sn 3 d 5∕2
and Sn 3 d 3∕2 , respectively 29 . The Sn 3 d
peaks showed only one symmetric component without any shoulder, which indicates only a Sn 4+
chemical state in the SnO 2
nanoparticles. The O 1 s
X-ray photoelectron spectrum of SnO 2
exhibits a degree of asymmetry in its shape ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ), where the peak with a lower binding energy (530.7 eV) corresponds to the O atoms of the SnO 2
crystal and the second peak (532.1 eV) can be attributed to the surface oxygen-group absorbance 29 . For comparison, the core-level spectra of TiO 2
have also been given ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ), and are similar to SnO 2
( Supplementary Fig. 2 ), indicating no additional metal chemical states except for Ti 4+
(ref.  30 ). The work function ( W S ), valance band maximum (VBM) and bandgap ( E g ) of the SnO 2
nanoparticles are 4.36 eV ( Fig. 2a ), 3.74 eV ( Fig. 2b ) and 3.79 eV ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ), respectively. It can be calculated that the conduction band ( E C ) of the SnO 2
nanoparticles is 4.31 eV, as obtained from
E C
=

+ VBM −
E g
based on the semiconductor band structure ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ); this is much deeper than that of TiO 2
(3.77 eV,
Fig. 2a,b
and
Supplementary Figs 3 and 4 ) 21 . One can also estimate that the conduction band of perovskite (FAPbI 3 ) x (MAPbBr 3 ) 1− x
is 4.36 eV from
Fig. 2
and
Supplementary Figs 4 and 5 . In principle, the deeper conduction band of SnO 2
compared with TiO 2
could enhance charge transfer from perovskite to the electron transport layer ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ) 21 . The possible band alignment between (FAPbI 3 ) x (MAPbBr 3 ) 1− x
and SnO 2
is shown in
Fig. 2c . In addition to energy band alignment, the charge mobility of the electrons also affects the charge transfer. A low mobility of the electron transport layer indicates more traps and will slow down charge transport. This could lead to charge accumulation at the interface, which will induce an energy barrier to suppress the charge transport. We measured the mobility of SnO 2
and TiO 2
colloidal films by means of the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model 18 , and it was found that the mobility of the SnO 2
film is about 1.9 × 10 −3  cm 2  V −1  · s, which is much higher than that of TiO 2
(3.3 × 10 −5  cm 2  V −1  · s). The higher mobility of the ETL used could improve charge transport, and the higher injection current from the ITO/SnO 2 /Spiro-OMeTAD/Al device compared ITO/TiO 2 /Spiro-OMeTAD/Al could confirm this argument ( Supplementary Fig. 7 ).

colloidal film using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model with device structure of ITO/Al/metal oxides/Al. Measurement data (circles), which were fitted by a line with a slope of 2 (blue), the intercepts of the fitted line on log( J ) were used for the mobility calculation. Full size image Charge transfer studies Steady photoluminescence (PL) ( Fig. 3a ) showed a significant PL quench when depositing the perovskite layer on SnO 2 . Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) results showed that the lifetime of the perovskite layer can be significantly reduced when depositing it on SnO 2
nanoparticles ( Fig. 3b ), indicating efficient electron transfer occurred from perovskite to SnO 2 . Consistent with our and other groups’ results 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , the PL intensity and lifetime of perovskite did not change very much when depositing the perovskite layer on TiO 2
( Fig. 3a,b ). This means that electrons cannot be efficiently transferred into the TiO 2
layer 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 . The less efficient charge transport between TiO 2
and perovskite could be ascribed to the electron barrier at the interface of between TiO 2
and perovskite, which could due to the shallower conduction band and lower electron mobility of TiO 2 , or the interfacial traps at the perovskite/TiO 2
interface 16 , 18 , 19 . This could be the reason why a mesoporous TiO 2
structure was needed to increase the charge decay channel and reduce charge accumulation at the TiO 2 /perovskite interface, and thus deliver efficient devices without hysteresis 4 . The enhanced charge transfer from perovskite to the SnO 2
layer indicated that the energy barrier had been reduced or removed, which could be caused by the deeper conduction band and high mobility of SnO 2 . It can be anticipated that the SnO 2 -based device could deliver a better, stabilized efficiency.

nanoparticles as ETLs. We used a two-step spin coating method to form the perovskite layer by inter-diffusion of lead halide and organic salts 31 . Here, a mixture of perovskite layers (FAPbI 3 ) x (MAPbBr 3 ) 1− x
was selected. FAPbI 3
was chosen due to its lower bandgap than that of MAPbI 3 , in order to increase light harvesting 32 , 33 . A small amount of MAPbBr 3
was added into FAPbI 3
to improve perovskite phase stabilization 33 . The composition of MAPbBr 3
in the perovskite mixture was about 3%, as determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) ( Supplementary Fig. 8 ), thus giving the form (FAPbI 3 ) 0.97 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.03 . The obtained perovskite film obtained showed an excellent morphology and was free of pinholes; the crystal size was close to 1 μm. The high quality of perovskite film formation was due to the introduction of Cl and moisture during the film growth 11 , 34 . There is negligible Cl in the final perovskite film ( Supplementary Fig. 8 ); the Cl element should have been vaporized, inferring that the Cl acts only as an intermediate element/material for perovskite film growth 11 . Moisture can enhance perovskite film growth via recrystallization 34 . It must be noted that the ‘white phase’ was observed when annealing the perovskite layer at higher temperature (for example, 150  ∘ C) ( Fig. 4a,b
and
Supplementary Fig. 9 ). X-ray diffraction results ( Fig. 4c ) confirmed that the PbI 2
phase was formed under higher temperature annealing, which is due to partial decomposition of the perovskite layer (FAPbI 3
→PbI 2 (s)+FAI(g)).
In situ
energy dispersive X-ray analysis in a scanning electron microscope further confirms that the ‘white phase’ is a PbI 2 -rich region ( Supplementary Fig. 10 ). The longer lifetime from the perovskite film with excess PbI 2
indicated that PbI 2
could passivate the defects and reduce recombination in the perovskite film ( Supplementary Fig. 11 ). The passivation could be explained as follows: while PbI 2
was formed at the grain boundary in the perovskite layer, a type-I band alignment could be formed between perovskite and PbI 2
(ref.  35 ), which blocks electron from entering the hole transport layer and also reduces recombination. It was found that PbI 2
passivation is beneficial for device performance, as will be shown below 35 , 36 . A cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy image of the completed device is shown in
Fig. 4d . The thicknesses of the electron transport layer (SnO 2 ) and the hole transport layer (Spiro-OMeTAD) are 25 nm and 150 nm, respectively. The optimized process for the SnO 2
layer can be found in
Supplementary Fig. 12 . To obtain the best performance, the SnO 2
layer should fully cover the ITO substrate, but it must not be so thick as to introduce a high series resistance. Therefore, a decent thickness of SnO 2
should be considered; in our case, the optimized thickness of SnO 2
is 25 nm. In this study, we deposited a thick perovskite layer (770 nm,
Fig. 4c ) to enhance the photo response of the perovskite layer in the infrared region 37 . Figure 4: Morphology and structure of the perovskite and its device structure. a , b , Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of perovskite films annealed under 135  ∘ C for 20 min and 150  ∘ C for 20 min, respectively.

d , Cross-section SEM image of the completed devices, with the structure glass/ITO/SnO 2 /(FAPbI 3 ) 0.97 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.03 /Spiro-OMeTAD/Au. Full size image We compared the device performance with and without the PbI 2
phase. It was found that the perovskite with excess PbI 2
showed better device performance, taking in account all the device performance parameters ( Fig. 5a ). In terms of the lifetime enhancement ( Supplementary Fig. 11 ), it could be assumed that the improvement of the device performance was due to passivation of the traps, including surface or grain boundary defects in the perovskite layer, which were considered as recombination centres 38 . In inorganic solar cells, a thin layer of wide bandgap or insulating materials is usually used for passivating the surface traps; for example, a thin layer of SiO 2
or Al 2 O 3
for Si solar cells 39
and the wide bandgap of AlGaAs for GaAs solar cells 40 . Here, in our study, the PbI 2
phase is expected to have a similar role in passivation for enhancing the device performance. Figure 5: Device performance of perovskite solar cells with the structure glass/ITO/SnO 2 /perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au. a , Device performance with (red) and without (black) excess PbI 2 .

d , Device performance distribution for 40 devices in one batch. The red curve represents a Gaussian function fit to the data. Full size image The best device performances of planar devices using SnO 2
nanoparticles as the ETL are shown in
Fig. 5b . The device showed an open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 1.09V, a short-circuit current ( J SC ) of 24.87 mA cm −2 , a fill factor (FF) of 74.77% and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.27% under reverse scan ( V OC
to
J SC ). It showed a
V OC
of 1.09 V, a
J SC
of 24.88 mA cm −2 , a FF of 75.73%, and a PCE of 20.54% under forward scan ( J SC
to
V OC ). The different scan directions showed almost the same performance, with only a slight difference in fill factor. More importantly, all the device performances are almost independent of the measurement conditions ( Supplementary Fig. 13
and
Supplementary Table 2 ), certainly indicating that the SnO 2 -based planar structure can achieve an efficient and stable power output. This behaviour is different from a traditional TiO 2 -based planar structure, as will be shown below. The typical external quantum efficiency of the devices is shown in
Fig. 5c . The photo response edge has been extended to 820 nm, compared with 780 nm from CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 . In the visible region, the external quantum efficiency can reach as high as 93%. The integrated short-circuit current (24.2 mA cm −2 ) matched well with the
J–V
results. The high short-circuit current can be ascribed to the high quality of the thick perovskite absorbing layer. To check reproducibility of the device performance, we collected the power conversion efficiency of one batch of devices (40 devices,
Fig. 5d ). The power conversion efficiencies range from 17.9% to 20.5%, and most of the device efficiencies are greater than 19%. One of our best devices was sent to an accredited PV calibration laboratory (Newport, USA) for certification, which confirmed a PCE of 20.51% under AM 1.5 G full-sun illumination under reverse scan ( V OC
to
J SC ) and 19.27% under forward scan ( J SC
to
V OC ), with a slow scan rate (0.026 V s −1 ). The measurement details and results can be found in
Supplementary Figs 14 and 15 . The certified efficiency is 19.9 ± 0.6% ( Supplementary Fig. 14 ), which is consistent with our internal measurement results. The stability of our devices was tested, and it was found that the devices can maintain almost their original efficiency when stored in dry air conditions for 40 days ( Supplementary Fig. 16 ). We also have tested the photo-stability of un-encapsulated SnO 2 - and TiO 2 -based devices under continuous one sun (100 mW cm −2 ) soaking in ambient air (temperature: 28  ∘ C, humidity: 37%). Interestingly, it was found that the SnO 2 -based devices have better photo-stability than the TiO 2 -based devices ( Supplementary Fig. 17 ); the mechanism is not entirely clear, and needs further study. Hysteresis study To further illustrate the role of the SnO 2
layer in reducing the hysteresis, we also made n-i-p planar-structure devices using TiO 2
as ETLs. Consistent with most previous results, the devices with TiO 2
ETLs showed serious hysteresis ( Supplementary Fig. 18
and
Supplementary Table 3 ) 4 , 9 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 . In previous reports, on modifying the TiO 2
surface with fullerene, for example, the hysteresis could be eliminated. Moreover, it was found that the TiO 2
cannot efficiently transfer electrons from perovskite ( Fig. 3 ) 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 . However, rapid electron extraction took place when introducing fullerene. Therefore, a good electron contact layer with fast charge extraction could reduce charge accumulation at the perovskite/contact layer interface induced by ion migration, and could partially or fully resolve the hysteresis issue 16 , 20 . From the band alignment shown in
Fig. 2c , the conduction band of the SnO 2
layer aligned well with perovskite. Ideally, there will be no electron barrier formed at the perovskite/SnO 2
interface, which should facilitate electron extraction. In addition, the higher mobility of SnO 2
will enhance charge transport and reduce charge accumulation at the interface. Steady photoluminescence and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) results confirmed the significant improvement of charge transfer from perovskite to SnO 2
compared with TiO 2
layers ( Fig. 3 ). To confirm the enhanced charge extraction in the devices using the SnO 2
electron transport layer, we characterized the devices by means of transient photocurrent decay and photovoltage decay 18 , 41 . It was found that the photocurrent decay time was significantly reduced from 22.53 μs to 4.01 μs ( Fig. 6a ), while the decay time of the photovoltage was increased from 6.22 μs to 8.59 μs ( Fig. 6b ) on replacing the TiO 2
layer with a SnO 2
layer as the electron transport layer, indicating a dramatic improvement of charge extraction and reduced recombination 41 . PL and transient photocurrent/photovoltage results both confirmed the enhancement of charge extraction on using SnO 2
as the ETL; thus, there will be no obvious charge accumulation at the interface between perovskite and SnO 2 , and the hysteresis can be eliminated, as shown in Fig. 5b . Figure 6: Charge transfer in the devices with different electron transport layers. a , Transient photocurrent decay curves using SnO 2
(red) and TiO 2
(black) as electron transport layers.
b , Transient photovoltage decay curves using SnO 2
(red) and TiO 2
(black) as electron transport layers. Full size image In addition, perovskite films grown on SnO 2
and TiO 2
showed similar crystal morphologies and thicknesses ( Supplementary Fig. 19 ), which further confirms that the different hysteresis behaviours mainly originate from the different electron transport layers. Above all, ion migration in the perovskite layer could induce charge accumulation at the interface and lead to hysteresis 13 , 14 , 15 . However, if the electron transport layer has sufficient ability to extract the charges, such as the SnO 2
we used, the hysteresis could be alleviated or fully eliminated 16 , 20 , 42 , 43 . Conclusions In conclusion, we have adopted low-temperature, solution-processed SnO 2
nanoparticles as the electron transport for planar-structure solar cells, and close to 20% power conversion efficiency with almost free of hysteresis was obtained. Our study showed the possibility of obtaining highly efficient perovskite solar cells without mesoporous structures. The efficiency of the planar structure could be further improved in the future through perovskite film growth or further passivation of the perovskite surface. Methods Preparation of SnO 2
and TiO 2
nanoparticles films. The SnO 2
colloid precursor was obtained from Alfa Aesar (tin(IV) oxide, 15% in H 2 O colloidal dispersion). (We have double-checked the solution concentration and the accurate concentration should be 20%, not the 15% labelled on bottle; before use, the particles were diluted by H 2 O to 2.67%). The final solution was spin coated onto glass/ITO substrates at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s, and then baked on a hot plate in ambient air at 150  ∘ C for 30 min. The TiO 2
nanocrystals were obtained from a non-hydrolytic sol-gel approach and the synthesis details can be found in ref.  9 . The final TiO 2
was collected and dispersed in ethanol to make a suspension with a concentration of 6 mg ml −1 . To stabilize the as-obtained TiO 2
solutions, TiAcac was added into the solution, whose final concentration of 15 μl ml −1 . Solar cell fabrication. The glass/ITO substrate was sequentially washed with isopropanol, acetone, distilled water and isopropanol. The sheet resistance of ITO is
∼ 15 Ω∕□ and the thicknesses of glass and ITO are 0.5 mm and 140 nm, respectively. The average transmittance of glass/ITO in the visible region is around 93%. For SnO 2
nanoparticles films, the diluted SnO 2
nanoparticles solution (2.67%) was spin coated on glass/ITO substrates in ambient air, and then annealed at 150  ∘ C for 30 min. For TiO 2
nanoparticles films, 6 mg ml −1
of TiO 2
solution was spin coated on glass/ITO substrates at 2,000 r.p.m. for 30 s, and annealed in ambient air at 150  ∘ C for 30 min. After depositing the electron transport layer, the perovskite layer was deposited by a two-step spin coating method; first, 1.3 M of PbI 2
in dimethylformamide (DMF) was spin coated onto the electron transport layer at 1,500 r.p.m. for 30 s, then annealed at 70  ∘ C for 30 min; second, after the PbI 2
had cooled down, the mixture solution of FAI:MABr:MACl (60 mg:6 mg:6 mg in 1 ml isopropanol) was spin coated onto the PbI 2
at 1,500 r.p.m. for 30 s, and then the film was taken out from the glove box and annealed in ambient air (30%–40% humidity) 34 . It was confirmed that humidity is beneficial in obtaining high-quality perovskite films 34 . The annealing was under either 135  ∘ C or 150  ∘ C for 20 min; 150  ∘ C annealing can deliver a higher performance due to the formation of the PbI 2
phase in the perovskite layer. After perovskite growth, the film was transferred into a N 2 -filled glovebox for Spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer coating. The Spiro-OMeTAD solution was coated at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s, where 1 ml Spiro-OMeTAD/chlorobenzene (90 mg ml −1 ) solution was employed with the addition of 45 μl Li-TFSI/acetonitrile (170 mg ml −1 ) and 10 μl tBP. Finally, a Au back electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation at a pressure of 3 × 10 −6  torr. The active area was 0.108 cm 2 . Characterization. J–V
characteristics of photovoltaic cells were taken using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit under a simulated AM1.5G spectrum. With a solar simulator (Enli Tech, Taiwan), the light intensity was calibrated by means of a KG-5 Si diode. The
I–V
measurements were carried out in ambient air. The devices are measured both in reverse scan (1.2 V →0 V, step 0.02 V) and forward scan (0 V →1.2 V, step 0.02 V), and the delay time has been selected from 1 ms to 1,000 ms. The devices were taken out for EQE measurements using a Enli Tech (Taiwan) EQE measurement system. We sent our best devices to an accredited PV calibration laboratory (Newport, USA) for certification. High-resolution TEM images were taken on an FEI Tecnai G2 F30 transmission electron microscope operated at 300 kV. The diluted SnO 2
nanoparticles solution was dropped onto the copper mesh and dried, after which the sample was loaded into the TEM chamber for measurement. A field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FEI NanoSEM650) was used to acquire SEM images. The instrument uses an electron beam accelerated at 500 V to 30 kV, enabling operation at a variety of currents. The X-ray diffraction patterns ( θ –2 θ
scans) were taken on a Rigaku D/MAX-2500 system using Cu Kα ( λ
= 1.5405 Å) as the X-ray source. Scans were taken with 0.5-mm-wide source and detector slits, with X-ray generator settings at 40 kV and 30 mA. The information was obtained from samples of SnO 2
powder and perovskite film deposited on glass substrates. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Thermo Scientific ESCALab 250Xi using 200 W monochromated Al Kα (1,486.6 eV) radiation. A 500 μm X-ray spot was used for XPS analysis. The base pressure in the analysis chamber was about 3 × 10 −10  mbar. Typically, the hydrocarbon
C 1 s
line at 284.8 eV from adventitious carbon is used for energy referencing. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was also carried out on a Thermo Scientific ESCALab 250Xi, with the HeI(21.22 eV) emission line employed for excitation. The data were acquired at a bias of −10 V. The work function of the measured samples can be calculated from following equation:

and SnO 2
films were measured using the SCLC model 18 , using a electron-only devices of ITO/Al/metal oxide/Al and taking current–voltage to a space-charge-limited form, where the SCLC is described by

of SnO 2
and TiO 2
are assumed to be 9 and 50, respectively (refs  44 , 45 ). We deposited thicker metal oxide films (300 nm) to form a dense film and avoid leakage; the thick film was produced by several repeated steps of spin coating. The mobilities of the SnO 2
and TiO 2
films were calculated to be 1.9 × 10 −3  cm 2  V −1  · s and 3.3 × 10 −5  cm 2  V −1  · s, respectively. Transient photocurrent and photovoltage measurements were measured on an in-house-built system, similar to that reported previously 18 .

Abstract The past several years have witnessed the rapid emergence of a class of solar cells based on mixed organic–inorganic halide perovskites. Today’s state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells (PSCs) employ various methods to enhance nucleation and improve the smoothness of the perovskite films formed via solution processing. However, the lack of precise control over the crystallization process creates a risk of forming unwanted defects, for example, pinholes and grain boundaries. Here, we introduce an approach to prepare perovskite films of high electronic quality by using poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as a template to control nucleation and crystal growth. We obtain shiny smooth perovskite films of excellent electronic quality, as manifested by a remarkably long photoluminescence lifetime. We realize stable PSCs with excellent reproducibility showing a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 21.6% and a certified PCE of 21.02% under standard AM 1.5G reporting conditions.

21 July 2022
Organic–inorganic halide perovskites are attractive materials for solar cells, because of their ease of fabrication, panchromatic absorption of sunlight and long carrier diffusion length 1 . Although the first solid-state perovskite cell with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.7% was reported only in 2012 2 , the PCE was raised to over 20% in four years ( http://www.nrel.gov/ncpv/images/efficiency_chart.jpg ). The control over both morphological and electronic properties of the perovskite films is crucial to achieve high-performance perovskite devices. Electronic trap states resulting from pinholes or crystal defects and grain boundaries enhance non-radiative recombination, severely reducing the charge carrier lifetime and the photoluminescence (PL) yield. This in turn entails a loss in open-circuit voltage and overall conversion efficiency 3 . The morphology of solution-processed perovskite film is mainly governed by nucleation and crystal growth. Generally, inducing rapid nucleation and slowing down the crystal growth are promising ways to obtain perovskite films of high optoelectronic quality. A variety of methods have been developed to retard perovskite crystallization, such as adding HI or HCl acid 4 , 5 , 6 , and employing additives such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) to form intermediate adducts with Pb 2+
(refs  7 , 8 ). Several other techniques 9 , 10 , 11 , 12
have been developed to improve the nucleation process, among which antisolvent-dripping has turned out to be an effective method 13 , 14
by triggering homogeneous nucleation at the surface of the formed layer (solid/antisolvent/air interfaces) to make smooth perovskite films with high surface coverage 15 . However, further exploration of enabling both faster nucleation and slower crystal growth remains challenging. Here, we introduce polymer-templated nucleation and growth (PTNG) as a method for crystal engineering of perovskites. The polymer [poly(methyl methacrylate), (PMMA)] enables heterogeneous nucleation which is believed to be orders of magnitude faster than the homogeneous nucleation due to the lowering of the nucleation free energy barrier 16 . On the other hand, PMMA slows down the perovskite crystal growth by forming an intermediate adduct with PbI 2
to allow the randomly formed nuclei to adjust their orientation to minimize the total Gibbs free energy and grow in the thermodynamically preferred orientation 17 . The cooperation of these two effects results in smooth perovskite films with fewer defects and larger oriented grains, enabling us to fabricate perovskite solar cells with a PCE over 21%. Polymer-templated nucleation and crystal growth Although PMMA has been widely used as a moisture protection barrier on top of the back contact of PSCs or mixed with carbon nanotubes to form the hole collection layer 18 , it has so far not been employed to affect the formation of the perovskite itself during solution processing. We produce the mixed cation perovskite films in a single step from a solution of formamidinium iodide (FAI), PbI 2 , methylammonium bromide (MABr) and PbBr 2
in a mixed solvent of dimethyl formamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and
N -methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) 13 , 19 . During the spin-coating of the perovskite solution, we introduce PMMA in a chlorobenzene/toluene mixture to template crystal formation and growth of the perovskite. The PMMA serves as a support to induce nucleation of small perovskite crystals and directs the ensuing growth of these crystals. By using this technique for film deposition we fabricate perovskite solar cells with the structure Au/Spiro-OMeTAD[2,2,7,7-tetrakis( N,N -di- p -methoxyphenyl-amine)9,9-spirobifluorene]/perovskite/mesoporous TiO 2 /compact TiO 2 /fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of which is shown in
Fig. 1a . Employing this solar cell configuration, we achieve the best PCE of 21.6% with a PMMA concentration
C PMMA
= 0.6 mg ml −1 . The photovoltaic metrics of the device are as follows: short-circuit current density ( J SC ) = 23.7 mA cm −2 , open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) = 1.14 V, and fill factor (FF) = 0.78 ( Fig. 1b ). One of the devices was sent for certification to Newport Corporation Technology and Application Center PV Lab, an accredited PV testing laboratory, confirming a PCE of 21.02% ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). The commonly observed hysteresis 20
is virtually negligible in our devices, as confirmed by  J–V
curves shown in
Fig. 1b . A histogram of two batches of cells ( Supplementary Fig. 2
and
Table 1 ) indicates excellent reproducibility with an average PCE of 21.0%. Preliminary stability investigations show that the unsealed devices containing PMMA are stable, showing only a 3.3% decay in PCE during exposure to ambient air for two months in the dark ( Supplementary Fig. 3
and
Tables 2 and 3 ). The photovoltaic metrics of the PSCs fabricated from the PTNG method varying
C PMMA
are summarized in
Fig. 1c . Upon increasing the PMMA concentrations ( C PMMA , mg ml −1 ) in mixed chlorobenzene and toluene (volume ratio of chlorobenzene and toluene is 9:1) solution, the PCE first augments and subsequently decreases with a peak at
C PMMA
= 0.6. Upon increasing the
C PMMA
from 0 to 0.6 mg ml −1 , the
V oc
rises from 1.10 V to 1.14 V, and the FF from 0.74 to 0.78. Figure 1: Device structure and performance. a , A coloured high-resolution cross-section SEM image of a complete solar cell fabricated by the PTNG method, where a smooth and compact perovskite capping layer fully covers the mesoporous TiO 2

Full size image Figure 2
shows the SEM images of perovskite films deposited on m-TiO 2 /bi-TiO 2 /FTO substrate by varying
C PMMA . As illustrated in
Fig. 2a , the morphology of the pre-perovskite intermediates 21
present before annealing changes from a mixture of randomly distributed nanoparticles into homogeneous nanorods.
Figure 2b
and c show the perovskite film after annealing, indicating that the grain size of the perovskite film produced by the PTNG method increases with
C PMMA
and most of the grain boundaries become perpendicular to the substrate, benefiting a reduction in the surface area of the grain boundaries. Hence, the PMMA is expected to uniformly trigger heterogeneous nucleation over the perovskite precursor film, improving the grain size and facilitating the perovskite to grow in a preferred direction, with reflection of the facet with (111) indices being dominant because of the low symmetry of the trigonal perovskite ( p 3 m 1) phase, as indicated in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern in
Fig. 3a . Whereas numerous grain boundaries exist in cross-sectional SEM of the reference film, no obvious boundary exists in the PTNG-treated film. On the other hand, for
C PMMA
> 0.6 mg ml −1 , new species appeared on the surface of the perovskite grains, which we attribute to PMMA particles, as the brighter signal indicates charge accumulation resulting from poor conductivity. This phenomenon accounts for the deterioration of the PV metrics when
C PMMA
exceeds 0.6 mg ml −1
PMMA because the excess of PMMA will impair charge carrier collection. Figure 2: Scanning electron microscopy images. Top ( a , b ) and cross-sectional ( c ) SEM of perovskite films deposited by the PTNG method with different concentrations (mg ml −1 ) of PMMA.

arises from the (001) lattice planes of hexagonal (2H polytype) PbI 2 . The excess PbI 2
is believed to passivate surface defects, increasing the solar cell performance 13 , 22 . All the samples show the same trigonal perovskite phase with the dominant (111) lattice reflection. We speculate the (111) plane to exhibit the smallest surface energy because the majority of grains exhibit this orientation to minimize the total Gibbs free energy of the system. With increasing
C PMMA , the (111)-oriented grains grew faster by consuming neighbouring non-oriented crystals, either by regular grain growth or grain attachment, as evidenced by the increased ratio between the (111) and (123) peak at 13.9 ∘
and 31.5 ∘
in the presence of PMMA. By taking the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the (111) reflection, we calculate the crystallite size using Scherrer’s equation. Their dimension increases from 41 to 55, 70, 94 and 112 nm on increasing
C PMMA
from 0 to 4 mg ml −1 . We attribute the larger crystal sizes to the templating effect of PMMA on the crystal growth. The carbonyl groups in PMMA form an intermediate adduct with PbI 2 , as revealed by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra in
Fig. 3b . The stretching vibration of C=O bond in pure PMMA appears at 1,735 cm −1 , while it shifts to 1,723 cm −1
upon interaction with PbI 2 . The shift of the C=O vibration in PMMA to lower wavenumber upon interaction with PbI 2
is indicative of the formation of an intermediate PMMA–PbI 2
adduct, since it is a consequence of a weakened C=O bond strength caused by interaction with the Lewis acid PbI 2 . The formation of such an adduct 7
is expected to retard the crystal growth and improve the crystallinity of the perovskite film. Time-resolved photoluminescence decay To analyse the dynamics of recombination, we performed time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay measurements ( Supplementary Figs 4 and 5 ). The PL decays for perovskite films with
C PMMA
= 0 and 0.6 mg ml −1
deposited on a m-TiO 2 /c-TiO 2 /FTO substrate are shown in
Fig. 3c , revealing a much faster PL decay for the reference than the PMMA-treated film. The PL decay curves were fitted to a bi-exponential rate law:

where
A 1
and
A 2
are the relative amplitudes and
τ 1
and
τ 2
are the lifetimes for the fast and slow recombination, respectively 23 . The decay is attributed mainly to trap-assisted recombination at defects. The film with the PMMA treatment exhibits fast and slow phase lifetimes of
τ 1
= 23.9 ns (fraction
A 1
= 0.37) and
τ 2
= 259.3 ns (fraction

= 0.63), respectively. In contrast, the sample without the PMMA treatment gives
τ 1
= 18.7 ns (fraction
A 1
= 0.66) and
τ 2
= 123.6 ns (fraction
A 2
= 0.34), respectively. This indicates a lower defect concentration and hence superior electronic quality for the PMMA-containing perovskite polycrystalline film, consistent with the higher
V oc
of the corresponding PSC 13 . X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in
Fig. 3d
shows Pb 4f spectra. There are two main peaks Pb 4f 7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 at 138.0 and 142.8 eV, respectively. We attribute the two small peaks located at 136.4 and 141.3 eV to the presence of metallic Pb (ref.  24 ). The presence of a substantial amount of atomic Pb is an indication of the existence of iodide vacancies in the perovskite lattice of the control sample. The metallic lead species in the film are likely to act as non-radiative recombination centres which impair solar cell operation. Thus, elimination of the metallic lead content is critical to realize perovskite films of better electronic quality 23 . Interestingly, the atomic Pb peak is greatly reduced in the PMMA-treated films, probably due to a lower level of iodide vacancies in the crystal lattice of the PMMA-treated films. A lower level of Pb defects can reduce the non-radiative recombination and increase the PL lifetime, in line with the TRPL results. Conclusion In conclusion, we introduce a method for preparing perovskite films of high electronic quality and implement it for the fabrication of PSC with an excellent performance and certified PCE attaining 21%. Future development of the method will enable further performance gains. Methods Solar cell preparation. A 30 nm TiO 2

(Dyesol paste) and ethanol is 1:6), then the substrates was sintered at 500  ∘ C for 20 min. The perovskite film was deposited by spin-coating onto the TiO 2
substrate. The [(FAI) 0.81 (PbI 2 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15 ] precursor solution was prepared in a glovebox from 1.35M Pb 2+ (PbI 2
and PbBr 2 ) in a mixed solvent of DMF, NMP and DMSO (where the molar ratio of DMF/DMSO is 5:1, and the molar ratio of Pb 2+ /[(DMSO) 0.8
(NMP) 0.2 ] is 1:1). The spin-coating procedure was done in a dry air flow in a glove box at a spin-coating speed of 6,500 r.p.m. for 30 s. At 15 s before the last spin-coating step, PMMA solution with different concentrations from the mixed solvent of chlorobenzene and toluene (volume ratio of chlorobenzene and toluene is 9:1) was pipetted onto the substrate. Thereafter, the substrate was put onto a hotplate for 1 h at 100  ∘ C. After cooling down to room temperature, the solution with the hole-transporting material spiro-OMeTAD was deposited on top by spin-coating. The spin-coating procedure was done in a dry air flow in a glove box at a spin-coating speed of 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. The spiro-OMeTAD solutions were prepared dissolving the spiro-OMeTAD in chlorobenzene at a concentration of 60 mM, with the addition of 30 mM bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide from a stock solution in acetonitrile, 200 mM of tert-butylpyridine. Finally, 80 nm of gold was deposited by thermal evaporation using a shadow mask to pattern the electrodes. Characterization. Current–voltage characteristics were recorded by applying an external potential bias to the cell while recording the generated photocurrent with a digital sourcemeter (Keithley Model 2400). The light source was a 450-W xenon lamp (Oriel) equipped with a Schott K113 Tempax sunlight filter (Praezisions Glas and Optik GmbH) to match the emission spectrum of the lamp to the AM1.5G standard. Before each measurement, the exact light intensity was determined using a calibrated Si reference diode equipped with an infrared cutoff filter (KG-3, Schott). A mask of 0.1051 cm 2
was applied for measurement. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were recorded on an X’Pert MPD PRO (PANalytical) equipped with a ceramic tube providing Ni-filtered (Cu Kα = 1.54060 Å) radiation and a RTMS X’Celerator (PANalytical). The measurements were done in the Bragg–Brentano geometry from 2 θ
= 8 to 88 ∘ . The samples were mounted without further modification and the automatic divergence slit (10 mm) and beam mask (10 mm) were adjusted to the dimension of the films. A step size of 0.008 ∘
was chosen for an acquisition time of 270.57 s deg −1 . A baseline correction was applied to all X-ray powder diffractograms to compensate for the broad feature arising from the FTO glass and anatase substrate. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were recorded using a high-resolution scanning electron microscope (ZEISS Merlin). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted on a PHI VersaProbe II XPS system equipped with a small spot X-ray beam, automated charge compensation, monatomic and cluster ion guns (Ar+, C60, Ar cluster), heating/cooling stage and angle-resolved XPS. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded with a Fluorolog-Horiba fluorometer. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) experiments were performed by exciting the perovskite samples deposited on mesoporous TiO 2 /compact TiO 2 /FTO at 420 nm.

Abstract The ionic defects at the surfaces and grain boundaries of organic–inorganic halide perovskite films are detrimental to both the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells. Here, we show that quaternary ammonium halides can effectively passivate ionic defects in several different types of hybrid perovskite with their negative- and positive-charged components. The efficient defect passivation reduces the charge trap density and elongates the carrier recombination lifetime, which is supported by density-function-theory calculation. The defect passivation reduces the open-circuit-voltage deficit of the p–i–n-structured device to 0.39 V, and boosts the efficiency to a certified value of 20.59 ± 0.45%. Moreover, the defect healing also significantly enhances the stability of films in ambient conditions. Our findings provide an avenue for defect passivation to further improve both the efficiency and stability of solar cells.

Organic–inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) semiconductors embrace a unique set of intriguing optoelectronics attributes, such as strong light absorption 1 , high charge carrier mobility 2 , and long intrinsic carrier recombination lifetime 3 , achieving impressive power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) with a relatively simple and low-cost route. The history of PCE enhancement for thin-film and polycrystalline photovoltaic cells has witnessed the importance of reducing charge-recombination loss both inside the photoactive layer and at the electrode contacts 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 . Passivation of defects at the film surface becomes critical when the charge recombination inside the OIHP layer is negligible 5 , 9 . The insensitivity to point defects and easy crystallization of OHIP materials give rise to negligible charge recombination in perovskite polycrystalline thin films. However, the much shorter measured photoluminescence recombination lifetime of the polycrystalline films than the intrinsic carrier recombination lifetime from a single-crystal interior indicates that there is still a high density of defects at the surface and grain boundaries of polycrystalline grains that are not benign electronically 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 . These defects most likely originate from the low thermal stability, or low formation energy of OHIP materials containing organic components that easilyevaporate from the surface during the thermal annealing process 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 . These surface and grain boundary (GB) defects may not dramatically reduce device photocurrent output, because some of the trapped charges may still escape over a long time and be collected by the electrodes, as evidenced by the relatively large short circuit current ( J SC ) of many non-optimized devices, while they would significantly impact the open circuit voltage ( V OC ) of the devices due to their energy disorder and reduced carrier concentration, which pull down the quasi-Fermi level splitting 18 , 19 , 20 . In addition, these defects can cause other device instability issues, including ion migration and associated current hysteresis, and device degradation in ambientenvironment 17 , 21 , 22 . Our recent study of moisture-dependent perovskite grain stability clearly showed that the degradation of perovskite grains was initialized by the defective surface and GBs, while some single crystals with low surface defect density and no GBs could be stable in air for several years 23 . The ionic defects (for example, iodine or methylammonium vacancies) in the polycrystalline film have a small migration activation energy (<0.1 eV) under 1 sun illumination 24 , 25 , 26 . The defects could also initialize the permeation of moisture or oxygen into the perovskite films to accelerate the degradation of perovskite devices. Thus, it is highly desirable to electronically passivate the defects at surface and GB to boost the PCE, and to heal these defects to prolong the durability of OIHP solar cells. The ionic nature of OIHP materials imposes different requirements for defect passivation than covalent-bonding semiconductors such as silicon (Si), because the defects in OIHP materials are charged, either positively or negatively. The passivation of Si is mainly achieved by the elimination of the Si dangling bonds by formation of Si–O, Si–N or Si–H covalent bonds 27 , 28 , 29 , which is however not applicable to strong ionic OIHPs. So far, different passivation molecules have been reported to perform as electron donors or electron acceptors that can interact with the charged defects of OIHPs, and thereafter annihilate the relevant defect-induced charge traps 11 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 . Lewis acids, such as phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), as a good electron transporting material could accept an electron from the negative-charged Pb–I antisite defects PbI 3 −
or under-coordinated halide ions and thus passivate the halide-induced deep traps 11 , 30 , 31 . Lewis base molecules, such as thiophene or pyridine, usually perform as the electron donors, which could bind to the positively charged under-coordinated Pb 2+
ions 32 , 33 , 34 . However, most of these passivation molecules could only passivate one type of defect, either positive or negative charged defects. The passivation of charge defects in OIHP should take the charge neutrality into consideration. In this study, we report that quaternary ammonium halides (QAHs) with a structure of NR 4 + X − , where R is an alkyl or aryl group and X is halide, can efficiently passivate charged defects in OIHP with quaternary ammonium and halide ions. The QAH passivation remarkably reduces the trap density and prolongs the carrier lifetime, which universally enhances the
V OC
of the OIHP planar heterojunction devices with different bandgaps and consequently increases the PCE by 10%–35% compared with the devices with PCBM passivation. This strategy can also enhance the stability of OIHP devices, with almost no efficiency loss after 800 h of storage in ambient conditions. These results highlight the importance of all-round passivation of charged ionic defects for improvement of the efficiency and durability of OIHP devices. Photovoltaic device architecture and performance The planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells in this study were structured as poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA)/CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 /functional layer/fullerene (C 60 )/2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP)/copper (Cu), as shown in
Fig. 1a . Here the active layers of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
were formed by the low-temperature two-step interdiffusion of lead iodide (PbI 2 ) and a methyl ammonium iodide (MAI) stacking layer, and then followed by a solvent annealing process 36 , 37 , 38 . In our previous studies, the fullerene derivative PCBM is used as the perovskite passivation material, which is used for the control device here. With an initial objective to enhance their moisture stability, we replaced PCBM by amphiphilic molecules with different functional groups, including
L -α-phosphatidylcholine, Tween 20 and polyethylene-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (PE-PEG) whose chemical structures are shown in
Fig. 1c,d . Our parallel studies showed that converting the surface of the electron transport layer to hydrophobic could enhance the water resistance of the perovskite films and device stability in moisture 39 . The application of amphiphilic materials was designed to attach them to the perovskite layer with the hydrophilic side, and expose the hydrophobic side to air 40 , 41 .
Figure 2a
shows the current density–voltage ( J – V ) curves of the MAPbI 3
devices with deposition of different passivation layers. The control device with the PCBM layer showed typical performance with a short circuit current density ( J SC ) of 22.5 ± 0.39 mA cm −2 , a
V OC
of 1.04 ± 0.02 V, a fill factor (FF) of 73.0 ± 2.05%, and a PCE of 17.1 ± 1.1%. Compared with the device with PCBM layers, the performances of the MAPbI 3
devices with Tween and PE-PEG buffer layers were even worse with maximum PCE between 13.6% and 15.5%, even after we optimized the concentration of Tween and PE-PEG. This indicates that Tween and PE-PEG cannot passivate the surface defects on MAPbI 3 . In striking contrast, the devices with the
L -α-phosphatidylcholine layer showed a significantly improved performance with a
J SC
of 22.7 mA cm −2 , a
V OC
of 1.08 V, a FF of 80.0%, and a PCE of 19.6% for the best device. The average PCE of the devices with
L -α-phosphatidylcholine reached 18.7 ± 0.9%. The performance enhancement and hysteresis-free behaviour ( Fig. 2a
and
Supplementary Fig. 1 ) were tentatively attributed to the passivation effect of
L -α-phosphatidylcholine molecules. Figure 1: Device structure and passivation mechanism by quaternary ammonium halides. a , The device structure of perovskite planar heterojunction solar cells.

curves of the champion device prepared by choline chloride passivation measured in both reverse (red) and forward (blue) scanning directions. Full size image The distinct performance led us to think about what is unique about the
L -α-phosphatidylcholine molecule in passivating MAPbI 3 . In comparison with Tween and PE-PEG,
L -α-phosphatidylcholine has the same long alkyl chain, while the difference is that
L -α-phosphatidylcholine has a choline phosphate zwitterion structure that is a type of neutral molecule with both positive and negative electrical charges. Thus, we speculate that its zwitterion structure with the choline group passivates MAPbI 3 . To verify this, we used two other choline zwitterion molecules, also known as quaternary ammonium halides, including choline iodide and choline chloride, which have no long alkyl chain, as the interfacial layer. As shown in
Fig. 2b , the
V OC
of the perovskite devices was significantly increased by choline iodide and choline chloride as passivation layers without sacrificing the
J SC
and FF of the devices, which confirmed our speculation. The devices with choline iodide and choline chloride showed higher
V OC
of 1.14 and 1.15 V. Consequently, the highest PCEs of the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3
devices with choline iodide and choline chloride passivation layers were increased to 20.1% and 20.0%, respectively. The average PCE of the devices with choline iodide and choline chloride passivation layers are 19.3 ± 0.8% and 19.4 ± 0.6%, respectively.

values are 1.04, 1.09, 1.13 and 1.13 V for the devices with PCBM,
L -α-phosphatidylcholine, choline iodide and choline chloride, respectively. The larger average
V OC
of the devices passivated by QAHs than by
L -α-phosphatidylcholine indicates that there is an additional passivation effect from the halide ions, because both of them have the quaternary ammonium component.
Supplementary Fig. 2
shows scanning electron micrographs for MAPbI 3
film after QAH deposition, which reveals no obvious damage to the morphology of the film. There are both positively charged cationic and negatively charged anionic defects in OIHPs, such as I −
and MA +
vacancies, respectively, while quaternary ammonium ions are expected to passivate only MA +
vacancies by occupying cuboctahedral sites to compensate the MA +
loss on the film surfaces, as illustrated in
Fig. 1b . Loss of halide ions by the evaporation of MAI during the thermal annealing process needs to be compensated by additional halide ions. Therefore, a complete defect passivation is critical in achieving the high-efficiency device reported here. The notable better passivation effect of choline chloride than choline iodide can be explained by the stronger Pb–Cl bonding than Pb–I bonding, and a small amount of Cl addition has been broadly reported 13 , 42
to enhance the charge-recombination lifetime in MAPbI 3 . On the basis of the mechanism of passivation presented here, any zwitterion molecular structure should have a good passivation effect, because they have both negative and positive electric charges. A zwitterion molecule may passivate both cationic and anion defects if the spacing of these defects happens to be the same as the size of the zwitterion molecule. However, the defects at the surface of perovskite films may have very complicated distributions and compositions. The positive and negative charge defects may distribute away from each other, and their molar ratio may not be 1:1, because the perovskite film surface does not necessarily reach thermal dynamic stable states right after annealing processing, and the surface defects may pair up with bulk defects. In this context, the QAH molecule with separated positive and negative ions has the advantage of self-adaptive selection of defects with opposite charges for passivation, which is not limited by the complicated surface defect composition or distribution. To test the passivation effect of QAH for perovskite films fabricated by different methods and with different compositions, various perovskite absorbers were fabricated by various approaches including a one-step anti-solvent method 43
and a two-step interdiffusion method 36 , 37 , 38 , and with different compositions of OIHPs whose bandgaps vary from 1.51 to 1.72 eV. The device fabrication method, composition and performance are summarized in
Table 1 . For the FA 0.83 MA 0.17 Pb(I 0.83 Br 0.17 ) 3
perovskite films made by one-step anti-solvent methods, choline chloride passivation can also greatly improve the photovoltaic performance, as shown in
Fig. 2d . The best PCE of 21.0 % was achieved by choline-chloride-passivated FA 0.85 MA 0.15 Pb(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3
with a
J SC
of 23.7 mA cm −2 ,
V OC
of 1.13–1.14 V, and FF of 78.0 % under forward and reverse scanning with negligible hysteresis, as shown in
Fig. 2e . The photovoltaic parameters of the FA 0.85 MA 0.15 Pb(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3
devices (20 cells) with different passivation treatments are summarized in
Supplementary Fig. 4 , indicating significant
V OC
enhancement and excellent reproducibility for the devices with choline chloride passivation. The average PCE of the devices with choline chloride is 20.1 ± 0.42%. One of the unencapsulated devices was sent to an accredited independent photovoltaic test laboratory (Newport Corporation PV Lab, Montana, USA) for certification. The device with a photomask area of 7.16 mm 2
displayed a certified PCE of 20.59 ± 0.45% and an absence of photocurrent hysteresis ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ), which represents a record PCE for p–i–n structured OIHP solar cells. The reported certified PCEs of the planar heterojunction OIHP solar cells reached 19.9% and 20.1% based on SnO 2
and chlorine-capped TiO 2
electron transport layers, respectively 44 , 45 . Table 1 Summary of the best device performance for the choline chloride and PCBM passivated devices with different perovskite composition. Full size table The passivation effect on FA 0.83 MA 0.17 Pb(I 0.6 Br 0.4 ) 3
with a bandgap of 1.72 eV demonstrated significant improvement with an increased PCE of 17.2% after QAH passivation ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ), which is among the highest PCEs for perovskite solar cells with a similar bandgap. The average PCE of the FA 0.83 MA 0.17 Pb(I 0.6 Br 0.4 ) 3
devices is 16.1 ± 1.1%. Two-step-processed FA x MA 1− x Pb(Br 1− x I x ) 3
perovskites with an optical bandgap of 1.51 eV were also used to test the passivation effect of the QAH. It should be noted that it is difficult to exactly determine the composition of the perovskite films processed by the two-step method, so we write the composition of FA x MA 1− x Pb(Br 1− x I x ) 3
here. The
V OC
increased from 1.04 to 1.12 V and the highest PCE was boosted from 18.7% to 20.2% after replacing PCBM with choline chloride, as shown in
Supplementary Fig. 6 . A smallest
V OC
deficit of 0.39 V was achieved. The average PCEs of the FA x MA 1− x Pb(Br 1− x I x ) 3
devices with PCBM and choline chloride layers are 17.5 ± 1.2% and 19.3 ± 0.9%, respectively. Furthermore, we incorporated choline chloride into the FA 0.83 MA 0.17 Pb(I 0.83 Br 0.17 ) 3
perovskite films by blending the choline chloride in the perovskite precursor solution before depositing it on the PTAA layers. The
V OC
of such devices is comparable to those with only surface treatment by choline chloride ( Supplementary Fig. 7 ). It should be noted that we do not expect the choline chloride blended in precursor solution would be incorporated into the perovskite lattice due to its too large molecular size, and thus the choline chloride is expected to stay at the film surface and/or grain boundaries during perovskite film formation. This result basically confirms that the surface charge traps cause the majority of the
V OC
losses in perovskite solar cells. Nevertheless, the capability of directly blending the choline chloride in the precursor solution for film fabrication does reduce an additional step of coating with choline chloride. Mechanistic study of passivation effect of QAHs Time-resolved photoluminescence decay measurements ( Fig. 1e ) of MAPbI 3
perovskite films with different passivation layers were performed to find the origin of the improved efficiency. The time-resolved photoluminescence decay of perovskite films with different passivation layers showed a bi-exponential decay with a fast and a slow component. Previous studies of charge recombination in perovskite films suggest that the fast decay process is caused by bimolecular recombination of photo-generated free carriers, and the slow decay process is attributed mainly to trap-assisted recombination 5 , 20 . Here the choline chloride passivation mainly impacted the slow decay process, agreeing with the proposed mechanism that choline chloride passivates charge traps at the film surface. For the trap-assisted recombination, we deduced an increased recombination lifetime from 82.3 ns for the pristine film to 903.4 ns after choline chloride treatment. The steady-state photoluminescence spectrum ( Supplementary Fig. 8 ) shows that the choline-chloride-treated OIHP film had a sixfold stronger photoluminescence intensity than the control film. To find out how passivation affects the charge-recombination process in the operating devices, transient photovoltage measurement of the MAPbI 3
perovskite device was conducted. The devices were soaked under AM 1.5 simulated illumination, and laser pulses (337 nm, 4 ns) were applied to disturb the open-circuited devices to trigger a small transient photovoltaic signal. As seen in
Fig. 1f , the charge-recombination lifetime of the device with choline chloride passivation was increased to 0.56 μs in comparison with the 0.23 μs of the device with PCBM passivation. The transient photovoltage result also shows that the device with choline chloride passivation had a larger average photovoltage of 1.13 V than the devices with a PCBM layer (1.04 V), which is in accordance with the
J – V
measurement. For polycrystalline MAPbI 3
perovskite films, the reported trap densities are generally in the order of 10 17 –10 19  m −3 , which are much larger than that of the single crystals (10 10  m −3 ), giving much room for improvement 46 . To further analyse the passivation effect of the QAH, the trap density of states (tDOS) was measured for the devices fabricated by two-step-processed MAPbI 3
perovskite with choline chloride or PCBM passivation. We extracted the trap densities from the thermal admittance spectroscopy analysis, which is a well-established and effective technique to characterize both shallow and deep defects of thin-film and organic solar cells 11 , 47 .
Figure 3a
shows that the device with choline chloride layers had overall the lowest tDOS over the whole trap depth region. The device with choline chloride layers had low tDOS in the deeper trap region (0.40–0.52 eV), which was assigned to defects at the film surface 11 . In addition, the density of shallower trap states (0.35–0.40 eV), which was assigned to traps at GBs, in the choline-chloride-passivated devices was about three times smaller than in the PCBM-passivated devices. This indicates that choline chloride may also diffuse into grain boundaries to passivate them. The better passivation effect of choline chloride than PCBM verifies that both cationic and anionic defects in OIHPs need to be considered in passivation techniques.

g . Full size image As proof of the concept, two typical surface defect sites that have been reported to generate deep charge traps in OIHPs, an anionic Pb–I antisite defect on a PbI 2 -terminated surface and a cationic Pb cluster on a MAI-terminated surface, were investigated to demonstrate the trap passivation effect of the selected molecules 14 , 30 . We used a Pb–I antisite defect on a PbI 2 -terminated surface, and uncoordinated Pb clusters on MAI-terminated surface slabs that have a 2 × 2 periodicity in the
xy
plane, and the representative structure model can be found in
Fig. 3b-e . The control systems without choline chloride are shown in
Supplementary Figs 9–11 . The atomic positions in both defected and passivated systems are allowed to relax until the force is less than 0.03 eV Å −1 . The calculated density of states (DOS) of the passivated and unpassivated surfaces are plotted in
Fig. 3f,g ; the DOS values of the passivated surfaces are reversed to provide a side-by-side comparison. The Pb clusters on the perovskite surface cause many localized charge traps. As shown in
Supplementary Fig. 12 , the bond distances of d Pb1 - I1
and d Pb1 - I2
are 4.76 Å and 3.14 Å in the unpassivated system, and 3.54 Å and 3.39 Å in the passivated system. In the resulting binding structure of the Pb cluster after the passivation, the Pb cluster on the top of the MAI surface is bonded with Cl −
and two I −
of the top layer of MAI. The enhanced interaction between Pb and the surface slab resulted in an increase of the overlap between the wavefunction of the Pb cluster and the surface slab. This enhanced interaction between the Pb ion cluster and the MAI-terminated surface causes new hybridized states that bridge the trap states with conduction band edge states of the surface slabs, which prevents the trapping of charges. This enhanced interaction between Pb and the surface slab could also induce a slight shift of the band edge. For the PbI 3 −
antisite defects, the simulation shows that the gap states are almost eliminated after passivation, which has a better passivation effect as compared with PCBM 30 . Besides, the passivated surface also has a slightly larger bandgap than the unpassivated one. The shifts of trap states and band edges are primary due to the charge transfer between the passivation molecule and perovskite surface. The Bader charge analysis shows that the choline molecule can transfer about 0.8 electrons to the surface in the case of PbI 3 −
antisite defects. When adding choline chloride in the system, the defects undergo a migration process ( Supplementary Fig. 13 ): the antisite I −
moves to the top position of its neighbouring Pb 2+
and bonds with that Pb 2+ , leaving a Pb 2+
vacancy on the surface, and this Pb 2+
vacancy defect is reported to be benign 14 . Since choline chloride contains both positive and negative charges, we expect that it also interacts strongly with other charged defects. The density functional theory calculations indicate that QAHs could passivate trap states induced by both the cationic and anionic defect sites, a special feature for the passivation agents selected. It should be noted that the types of defect present at the perovskite films surface might be sensitive to the film formation process. It is not technically feasible yet to find out what types of defect are present in the perovskite films presented here. Therefore, it is not yet feasible to conclude that QAHs could passivate all types of defect at the film surface. Understanding the nature of surface defects will still be needed to ultimately understand the functions of the QAHs reported here. Stability of the perovskite solar cells with QAHs The stability of OIHP devices in ambient conditions is challenged by their sensitivity to moisture and oxygen due to the hygroscopic nature of the OIHP films. Recent studies revealed that the degradation of perovskite films was generally initialized at the defect sites at the film surface and grain boundaries where the molecules have highest activity and diffusivity and are more susceptible to attack by moisture and oxygen 23 , 41 . It should be noted that the defects that cause charge trapping and initialize material degradation might be different. Although surface defects such as MA +
vacancies formed by the evaporation of MAI during annealing do not cause deep traps in the perovskite material or impact the device efficiency, they may initialize the film degradation. Nevertheless, QAH ions are expected to have strong interaction with such ionic defects to neutralize the charges. We thus speculate that the interaction of the perovskite films with the choline chloride layer should also enhance the stability of the perovskite films in ambient environment, because covering the defective sites on the film surface with QAH ions should inhibit the permeation of moisture and oxygen through the defects. To verify this, the stability of FA 0.83 MA 0.17 Pb(I 0.83 Br 0.17 ) 3
devices with choline chloride and
L -α-phosphatidylcholine functional layers was monitored by putting the unencapsulated devices in an ambient atmosphere at room temperature and relative humidity of 50–85%, and the device performances are summarized in
Fig. 4 . The devices with choline chloride layers retained almost 100% of the initial PCEs after storage in ambient conditions for over one month. Interestingly, the
V OC
of the devices increased during the first 5 days of storage in both types of device with choline chloride passivation. The
L -α-phosphatidylcholine-modified devices showed inferior performance, 30% loss of the initial PCE after 800 h storage in ambient conditions, despite the fact that the long hydrophobic alkane tails could hinder the permeation of moisture. The difference in stability of the devices with two passivation layers highlighted the importance of healing both types of defect.
Figure 4e
shows the maximum power point tracking of the devices with choline chloride. The results show that the PCE decreased from 21.1% to 18.1%, and maintained 86% of the initial PCE under 1 sun continuous illumination for 26 h. The humidity stability test for the bare OIHP films ( Fig. 4f–k ) shows that the films with QAHs have a much slower degradation rate than the control films without QAHs when they were exposed to humidity of 90 ± 5% for the same time intervals of 2.5 h, and the corresponding X-ray diffraction results are shown in
Supplementary Fig. 14 . The much slower reduction of the perovskite (110) plane peak and the slower appearance of the PbI 2
peak in the perovskite films with
L -α-phosphatidylcholine and choline chloride treatment demonstrate the better moisture resistance capability enabled by the surface modification. This result conclusively confirmed that the healing of the defect sites by choline chloride could effectively improve the moisture stability of OIHP films.

Full size image Conclusion In summary, we have demonstrated that the passivation of ionic defects in OIHPs by QAHs is a general passivation approach to remarkably improve the efficiency and stability of OIHP solar cells. This strategy could lead to further increasing the PCE of perovskite solar cells by passivating both types of charged ionic defect in OIHPs. There is still room to further improve the passivation effect, as indicated by the photoluminescence lifetime of the perovskite films, which still have not reached that of the single crystals. Further understanding of the nature of the surface defects in polycrystalline OIHPs, including the defect type, defect concentration and defect distribution, will be very important to guide the design of next-generation passivation molecules to fully passivate all of the defects. We anticipate that the precision defect healing will be an important direction to improve the efficiency of perovskite solar cells to the theoretical limit, as well as to stabilize perovskite-based materials and devices. Methods Device fabrication. The MAPbI 3
films made by the two-step method were fabricated by the thermal annealing-induced interdiffusion method according to our previous publication 36 , 37 , 38 . The hole transport layer poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine) (PTAA) with a concentration of 2 mg ml −1
dissolved in toluene was spin-coated at the speed of 6,000 r.p.m. for 35 s and then annealed at 100  ∘ C for 10 min. PbI 2
beads (99.999% trace metals basis) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. After dissolving in
N , N -dimethylformamide (DMF) at a temperature of 100  ∘ C, around 50 μl of hot ( ∼ 90  ∘ C) 630 mg ml −1
PbI 2
DMF precursor solution was quickly dropped onto the substrate and spin-coated at the speed of 6,000 r.p.m. The as-fabricated PbI 2
films were dried and annealed at 90  ∘ C for 10 min. After the PbI 2
films cooled to 70  ∘ C, 60 μl of 63 mg ml −1
methylammonium iodide (MAI) 2-propanol (IPA) precursor solution at the temperature of 70  ∘ C was spun on the PbI 2
films. Subsequently, the sample was annealed at 70  ∘ C for 20 min and 100  ∘ C for 60 min. During the thermal annealing process, around 10 μl of DMF was added to the edge of the Petri dish when the temperature reached 100  ∘ C. Two-step-processed FA x MA 1− x Pb(Br 1− x I x ) 3
perovskites were made by a similar procedure to the MAPbI 3
films made by the two-step method. The main differences are: the concentration of PbI 2
solution used for spin-coating is 680 mg ml −1 ; the mixed halide precursor solution contains 90 wt% of FAI and 10 wt% MABr with a concentration range from 70 mg FAI/7 mg MABr to 75 mg FAI/7 mg MABr per millilitre. One-step-processed narrow-bandgap perovskite FA 0.83 MA 0.17 Pb(Br 0.17 I 0.83 ) 3
and wide-bandgap perovskite FA 0.83 MA 0.17 Pb(Br 0.4 I 0.6 ) 3
were fabricated by the solvent- and interface-engineering method as reported previously 43 . The process for making the hole transport layer PTAA film is exactly the same as the fabrication method mentioned in the two-step method. The perovskite precursor solution composed of mixed cations (lead (Pb), formamidinium (FA) and methylammonium (MA)) and halides (I, Br) was dissolved in mixed solvent (DMF/DMSO = 4:1). To improve the wetting property of the perovskite precursor on the PTAA film, the PTAA-coated ITO substrate was pre-wetted by spinning 50 μl DMF at 4,000 r.p.m. for 8 s. Then 100 μl precursor solution was spun onto PTAA at 2,000 r.p.m. for 2 s and 4,000 r.p.m. for 20 s, and the sample was quickly washed with 130 μl toluene at 13 s of the second-step spin-coating. Subsequently, the sample was annealed at 65  ∘ C for 10 min and 100  ∘ C for 10 min. The passivation material solution was coated onto the perovskite substrate by spin-coating at 4,000 r.p.m. for 35 s, and annealed at 100  ∘ C for 30 min. The PCBM, Tween and PE-PEG were dissolved in DCB, and the choline chloride and choline iodide were dissolved in IPA with a concentration of 1 mg ml −1 . The devices were finished by thermally evaporating C 60
(23 nm), BCP (8 nm) and copper (80 nm) in sequential order. Device characterization. Simulated AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm −2 ) was produced by a xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (Oriel 67005, 150 W Solar Simulator) for current density–voltage ( J–V
) measurements. The light intensity was calibrated by a silicon (Si) diode (Hamamatsu S1133) equipped with a Schott visible-colour glass filter (KG5 colour-filter). A Keithley 2400 Source-Meter was used for
J – V
measurement. The scanning rate was 0.1 V s −1 . The steady-state
V OC
and
J SC
were measured by zero bias current and zero bias voltage versus time, respectively. The steady-state PCE was measured by monitoring current with the largest power output bias voltage and recording the value of the photocurrent. X-ray diffraction measurements were performed with a Rigaku D/Max-B X-ray diffractometer with Bragg–Brentano parafocusing geometry, a diffracted beam monochromator, and a conventional cobalt target X-ray tube set to 40 kV and 30 mA. External quantum efficiency curves were characterized with a Newport QE measurement kit by focusing a monochromatic beam of light onto the devices. The scanning electron micrographs were taken with a Quanta 200 FEG environmental scanning electron microscope. For the transient photovoltage measurements, the device was serially connected to a digital oscilloscope (DOS-X 3104A) and the input impedance of the oscilloscope was set to 1 MΩ to form the open-circuit conditions, respectively, for monitoring the charge density decay. The transient photovoltage was measured under 1 sun illumination. An attenuated UV laser pulse (SRS NL 100 Nitrogen Laser) was used as a small perturbation to the background illumination on the device. The laser-pulse-induced photovoltage variation (Δ V ) and the
V OC
is produced by the background illumination. The wavelength of the N 2
laser was 337 nm, the repeating frequency was about 10 Hz, and the pulse width was less than 3.5 ns. First-principles calculation. First-principles calculation was carried out in the framework of density functional theory as implemented in the VASP program. The generalized gradient approximation in the form of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof was used for the exchange–correlation function. The ion–electron interaction is treated with the projector-augmented wave method. Surface slabs were modelled as PbI 2 -terminated or MAI-terminated symmetric (001) slabs of the tetragonal structure, which has 9 layers of MAI and PbI 2
in total. About 30 Å vacuum was added on top of the slab surface to minimize the interaction between the adjacent slabs. Humidity stability test. The perovskite OIHP films were stored at room temperature in a controlled-humidity glass chamber. The relative humidity calibrated by a digital hygrometer was controlled by the speed of nitrogen gas that flowed through the water, and the nitrogen gas eventually carries the moisture into the glass chamber. The relative humidity was maintained at 90 ± 5%. Data availability.

Abstract Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as an attractive photovoltaic technology thanks to their outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE). Further improvement in the device efficiency is limited by the recombination of the charge carriers in the perovskite layer even when employing heterojunction-based architectures. Here, we propose and demonstrate a p-type perovskite/n-type perovskite homojunction whose built-in electric field promotes oriented transport of the photo-induced carriers, thus reducing carrier recombination losses. By controlling the stoichiometry of the perovskite precursors, we are able to induce n-type or p-type doping. We integrate the homojunction structure in a planar PSC combining a thermally evaporated p-type perovskite layer on a solution-processed n-type perovskite layer. The PSC with a MAPbI 3
homojunction achieves a PCE of 20.80% (20.5% certified PCE), whereas the PSC based on a FA 0.15 MA 0.85 PbI 3
homojunction delivers a PCE of 21.38%. We demonstrate that the homojunction structure is an effective approach, beyond existing planar heterojunction PSCs, to achieve highly efficient PSCs with reduced carrier recombination losses.

Main Organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much interest thanks to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , which has increased from 3.8% up to 23.7% in less than 10 years 6 , 7 , facile processing methods 8 , 9
and outstanding optoelectronic properties 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 . Many effective strategies have been implemented to improve the performance of PSCs, such as solvent engineering 16 , 17 , 18 , compositional engineering 19 , 20
and alternative architecture design 21 , 22 , 23 . In particular, recent works 24 , 25 , 26 , 27
show that minimizing the carrier recombination losses, both in the perovskite layer and at the interfaces between different layers, enables a PCE closer to the theoretical value 1 . One strategy for reducing carrier recombination losses is to minimize defects on polycrystalline perovskite films 5 , 24 , 26 . For instance, additional iodide ions can be introduced into the organic cation solution, which decrease the concentration of the deep-level defects 5 . Another strategy is to engineer the device architecture employing mesoporous, planar or embedded structures to reduce the carrier losses during charge transport/extraction in PSCs 22 , 28 , 29 . Furthermore, the use of a bulk heterojunction active layer has been demonstrated to shorten the carrier transport distance in the perovskite films, thus reducing carrier losses 23 , 30 , 31 . Moreover, to decrease further the recombination losses and to improve the photoelectron collection, an inverted device architecture with a graded heterojunction structure has also been reported 32 . These results illustrate that improving the device architecture in heterojunction PSCs is a valid approach to decrease the carrier losses. While the heterojunction is constituted between the perovskite and electron/hole transport materials, the perovskite itself is also able to form a homojunction thanks to its unique self-doping property 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , which would minimize the presence of impurities that can act as carrier recombination centres 38 . Within the perovskite homojunction, a built-in electric field is formed that could enhance the oriented transport of the photo-induced electrons/holes, thus decreasing further carrier recombination in the perovskite layer. Therefore, it is a promising route to further improve the performances of PSCs. Here, we fabricate a perovskite p–n homojunction structure, via a combined deposition processing method, which is then integrated into planar PSCs. The built-in electric field in the homojunction, identified by cross-sectional Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), induces the oriented transport of the photo-induced carriers, thus reducing the carrier recombination losses as further corroborated by wxAMPs simulations. Planar PSCs with a MAPbI 3
(MA, methylammonium) p–n homojunction exhibit a steady-state efficiency of 20.80%. Furthermore, an average PCE of 21.38% is achieved by utilizing a FA 0.15 MA 0.85 PbI 3
(FA, formamidinium) p–n homojunction, exceeding the previously reported efficiency for planar PSCs. Fabrication of the planar homojunction PSC The proposed homojunction structure is composed of two perovskite layers with different doping, p-type and n-type perovskites, placed in junction with one another. A built-in electric field is therefore established at the p–n junction. Theoretical simulations and experimental evidence show that perovskites can be either p-type or n-type depending on the growth conditions and the ratio of the main precursors 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 . The MAPbI 3
films with Pb 2+ -rich/MA + -deficient/I − -deficient precursors are n-doped and those with MA + -rich/Pb 2+ -deficient precursors are p-doped, due to the presence of the defects induced by vacancies or interstitial elements. Previously, we have demonstrated that self-doping in perovskites can be tuned serially by controlling the process conditions, such as annealing temperatures 39 , 40 . Hence, it is feasible to fabricate a perovskite homojunction structure. We integrate the homojunction into PSCs based on the standard planar p–i–n 41 , 42
structure (Au/spiro-OMeTAD/MAPbI 3 /compact TiO 2 /fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)). Schematic illustrations of PSCs with the standard p–i–n structure and the homojunction structure are displayed in Fig.  1a,b . Figure  1c
presents a cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a homojunction PSC, where a smooth and uniform n-type MAPbI 3
layer can be clearly observed. Meanwhile, the dense and small-grain p-type MAPbI 3
layer with a thickness of ~60 nm is deposited on the top of the ~480 nm n-type MAPbI 3
layer. Fig. 1: Structure of planar PSCs with and without the homojunction and fabrication schematic of the homojunction PSC fabricated by the combined deposition method. a , The standard p–i–n PSC without the homojunction.
b , The PSC with the homojunction composed by p-type and n-type perovskite layers.
c , A cross-sectional SEM image of a homojunction PSC. The thicknesses of the TiO 2 , n-type perovskite, p-type perovskite, spiro-OMeTAD and Au electrode are about 20 nm, 480 nm, 60 nm, 200 nm and 100 nm, respectively.
d , The bottom n-type perovskite layer is deposited by a one-step spin-coating method. The top p-type perovskite layer is deposited by vacuum vapour deposition followed by a dipping process. Full size image To realize the perovskite homojunction structure, we propose a combined deposition method that combines a one-step spin-coating method for the deposition of the bottom n-type perovskite layer on top of the TiO 2
compact layer and a vacuum vapour deposition followed by a dipping step for the deposition of the top p-type perovskite layer over the n-type perovskite layer. The one-step spin-coating method allows control of the morphology, coverage, roughness and grain size of the n-type perovskite film. By varying the stoichiometry of the PbI 2 /MAI precursor ratio (1, 1.05, 1.10 and 1.15, respectively), we are able to induce the n-type doping in the perovskite. The deposition of the top p-type perovskite layer of the homojunction should not degrade the bottom n-type perovskite layer. While spin-coating would dissolve the bottom layer, vacuum vapour deposition has been reported to avoid damage of the organic/inorganic thin films underneath while enabling high-quality films 22 , 43 , 44 . We therefore choose this technique for depositing PbI 2
thin films on top of the n-type perovskite layer, followed by a dipping step in MAI/isopropanol solution to form MAPbI 3 . By adjusting the dipping time, we control the amount of MAI and thus the p-type doping. Finally, we choose the top p-type perovskite layer with a PbI 2
thickness of 60 nm followed by a dipping time of 60 s, whose precursor ratio is measured at ~0.91 (PbI 2 /MAI). The SEM images, X-ray diffraction patterns and high-resolution transmission electron microscope images (Supplementary Note  1 ) of perovskite layers are shown in Supplementary Figs.  1 – 3 , respectively. Carrier generation and recombination in homojunction PSC Figure  2a
shows a schematic energy level diagram and the working principle of the homojunction PSC and how carriers are transported across the layers. As photons are absorbed by both the p-type and n-type perovskites, the photo-induced carriers are generated in two perovskite layers. Then, the electrons and holes at the homojunction drift in opposite directions. Finally, the electrons are injected into the compact TiO 2
layer, the electron transport layer (ETL), and transported to the FTO cathode whereas the holes are injected into the spiro-OMeTAD layer, the hole transport layer (HTL), and transported to the Au anode.

Electrons (red circles) are transported through the n-type perovskite and collected at the FTO electrode. Holes (yellow circles) are transported through the p-type perovskite and collected at the Au electrode.

The solid black and dashed green arrows represent the built-in electric field direction and the carrier transport direction, respectively. The blue circles indicate electrons and the yellow circles indicate holes. The HTL and the ETL are shown in orange and blue, respectively.
c , Simulated generation and recombination rates of the photo-induced carriers across PSCs on illumination (AM1.5G) and under short-circuit conditions. The position refers to the cross-sections of the homojunction PSC, TiO 2
(20 nm)/n-type perovskite (480 nm)/p-type perovskite (60 nm)/spiro-OMeTAD (200 nm), and the standard p–i–n PSC, TiO 2
(20 nm)/undoped perovskite (540 nm)/spiro-OMeTAD (200 nm), respectively. The dashed blue lines are used to identify the layers in the PSCs. Full size image In PSCs with the standard p–i–n structure, the carrier transport in the perovskite film has no preferred direction, which can lead to unwanted carrier recombination. The extraction of photo-induced electrons and holes mostly occurs at the perovskite/ETL and the perovskite/HTL interfaces, respectively 27 . Hence, we design the homojunction structure to provide an extra built-in electric field in the perovskite film, in which electrons and holes move in opposite directions towards the ETL and the HTL, respectively, as shown in Fig.  2b , with a view to reducing carrier recombination. To verify the reduction in carrier recombination losses, carrier generation and recombination in PSCs is simulated with wxAMPS, which has been used to simulate thin-film solar cells 39 , 45 , 46 . The simulated structures for these two PSCs are shown in Supplementary Fig.  4a . In Fig.  2c , under short-circuit conditions, the rates of carrier generation are similar for both devices whereas the carrier recombination rate for PSCs with the homojunction is dramatically reduced near the p-type/n-type perovskite interface. We suggest that this is due to the electric field (Supplementary Fig.  4b ) induced by the homojunction that favours the oriented transport of electrons and holes. As a result of the influence of the homojunction, the concentration of the free holes increases in the p-type perovskite region away from the interface, whereas the concentration of the electrons decreases (Supplementary Fig.  4c,d ), providing evidence for carrier oriented transport. Besides, the simulated photocurrent density–voltage
(J – V)
curve (Supplementary Fig.  5
and Supplementary Note  2 ) in the homojunction PSC shows an obvious enhancement in open-circuit voltage ( V OC ). Optoelectronic properties of the perovskite homojunction To detect the doping property of as-prepared perovskite films, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) is carried out on perovskite films with various contents of PbI 2
in precursor solution. The valence spectra and the schematic energy level of the perovskite films are shown in Fig.  3a,b . The energy difference between the valence band and the Fermi level ( E F ) is 0.50 eV for the top p-type perovskite film with a PbI 2 /MAI ratio of 0.91, which confirms the p-type doping due to the perovskite’s bandgap of 1.55 eV. For the perovskite films containing excess PbI 2 , the
E F
is shifted close to the conduction band, with the increase in PbI 2
content in the precursor solution. This illustrates that the doping of the perovskite can be tuned from p-type to n-type by changing the PbI 2
content in the precursor solution. The full XPS spectra of the MAPbI 3
films are shown in Supplementary Fig.  6 . The position of the XPS peaks, especially for I and Pb, does not vary across the samples, thus indicating that the changes in the valence spectra are due to the perovskite materials, not measurement errors. The doping of the films is also characterized by Hall effect measurements. As shown in Fig.  3c
and Supplementary Table  1 , the carrier transport type converts from p-type to heavily n-type with increasing molar ratios of PbI 2 . Fig. 3: Doping, carrier transport and optical properties of the doped perovskite films. a , XPS valence spectra of MAPbI 3
films with different molar ratios of PbI 2 /MAI. The ratio of 0.91 indicates the p-type perovskite whereas the ratios of 1.05 and 1.1 indicate n-type perovskites.

g , h , the n-type perovskite is from the PbI 2 /MAI ratio of 1.15, whereas the p-type perovskite is from the PbI 2 /MAI ratio of 0.91. Full size image In addition, KPFM, which is employed to characterize the surface potentials, also confirms the results presented above. Figure  3d,e
shows KPFM potential images of the p-type perovskite films with a PbI 2 /MAI ratio of 0.91 and the n-type perovskite with a PbI 2 /MAI ratio of 1.15 (other ratios are reported in Supplementary Fig.  7 ), respectively, whereas the insets show the atomic force microscope (AFM) topographic images. It can be seen from Fig.  3d
that the surface potential of the p-type perovskite film is lower than that of the n-type perovskite film (Fig.  3e ), because of accumulated holes that lead the Fermi level to be located close to the valence band 39 . Contrarily, the higher surface potential of the n-type perovskite film shown in Fig.  3e
correlates with the n-type doping of the sample, which is consistent with the XPS and Hall results. To get a quantitative comparison, the profiles of the surface potentials of the films are compared in Fig.  3f . The surface potential on the n-type perovskite film is approximately 0.1 V whereas that of the p-type perovskite film is about −0.3 V. The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and the steady PL measurements are performed for the single n-type perovskite film (PbI 2 /MAI ratio of 1.15) and the perovskite homojunction film (n-type layer with a PbI 2 /MAI ratio of 1.15 and p-type layer with PbI 2 /MAI ratio of 0.91). As shown in Fig.  3g , TRPL decay of perovskite films showed a bi-exponential decay with a fast and a slow component. The bimolecular recombination rate,
a , and the decay lifetime,
τ , are estimated by fitting the decay curves with the expressions
I   =   I 0 (1  +   at ) −2
and
I   =   I 0  × exp(−( t / τ ) β ), respectively, and reported in the inset table of Fig.  3g . Previous studies of carrier recombination in perovskite films suggest that the fast decay process is caused by bimolecular recombination of photo-generated free carriers, whereas the slow decay process is attributed mainly to trap-assisted recombination 26 , 39 . Here, the perovskite homojunction film possesses a higher bimolecular recombination rate ( a  = 2.9 × 10 8  s −1 ) and a shorter fast decay lifetime (τ 1  = 6.3 ns) than the n-type perovskite film while the slow decay lifetime ( τ 2 ) is similar in the two samples. This indicates that efficient carrier transfer occurs between the two type perovskite layers in the homojunction without introducing more traps in the homojunction, possibly because of the built-in field at the p–n junction. PL spectra of these two films are consistent with the results of TRPL. As shown in Fig.  3h , the intensity of PL for the perovskite homojunction film is quenched by over 80% relative to that of the single n-type perovskite film, proving the efficient oriented transport of carriers between the n-type and p-type perovskite layers of the homojunction induced by the built-in potential, which can potentially enable higher performances in PSCs. Evidence for the perovskite p–n homojunction formation To further verify the formation of the p–n junction between the two perovskite layers, KPFM measurements have been performed on the cross-section of the homojunction structure under dark conditions, which can be used to study the electrical potential distribution across the internal interfaces in solar cells 37 , 47 , 48 , 49 . A schematic of the KPFM measurement principle is shown in Supplementary Fig.  8 . We fabricate the homojunction device based on FTO/n-type perovskite/p-type perovskite/Au and we cleave it to expose the cross-section without applying any treatments (for example, polishing or ion milling) to avoid complications and artefacts. Moreover, to exclude the influence of surface charges (defects) created on the cleaved cross-sectional surface, we employ a method for measuring the potential changes based on a series of bias voltages ( V b ) that are sufficiently small (from the −1.0 V to +0.5 V) 48 , 49 . We can obtain the obvious potential change caused by the transport and extraction of carriers at the junction, because the configuration of surface charges trapped at defects would not change significantly with such a small V b
(ref.
48 ). Figure  4a,b
shows the AFM topography of the homojunction device and the corresponding KPFM potential image at
V b  = 0, respectively. As shown in the potential profile in Fig.  4c , a potential drop is observed at the interface of the n-type/p-type perovskite layers caused by the carrier transport at the interface. This demonstrates the existence of a built-in electric field and thus the existence of the p–n junction. Besides, the dark and photoelectric
J – V
curves of homojunction devices show the typical rectifying characteristic of the p–n junction (Supplementary Fig.  9 ). Remarkably, this simple homojunction device composed of two perovskite layers and relative electrodes but without an HTL and an ETL exhibits a PCE of up to 8.08%, corroborating the presence of the p–n junction.

are averaged from the potential images along the device lateral direction. The potential differences in

are obtained by subtracting the potential under
V b  = 0 from the potentials under the various
V b . The profiles of the electric field difference in
f
are deduced by taking a derivative of the potential differences in
e . The device structure is FTO/homojunction (n-type perovskite/p-type perovskite)/Au. The dashed grey lines are used to identify the layers in the device in
c – f . Furthermore, FTO (grounded) and Au are connected to a voltage source to realize different bias voltages ( V b ) to the device. Full size image To obtain accurate information about the bulk property by cross-sectional potential measurements, we measured the potential changes on the same area induced by applying various
V b
(Supplementary Fig.  10 ). The averaged line profiles of the potential under different
V b
are shown in Fig.  4d . We subtract the
V b  = 0 potential profile from the −1.0 V (reverse) up to the +0.5 V (forward) potential profiles, calculate the potential difference curves at the various
V b
(Fig.  4e ) and then take the first derivative of the curves to obtain electrical field differences (Fig.  4f ). In Fig.  4d , we note that the potential in the FTO changes slightly with the different
V b , even though the FTO is grounded. One reason could be the non-negligible resistance of FTO (~16 Ω sq −1 ) and the contact resistance (~2 Ω), which act as series resistors with a voltage drop across them. Hence, the actual voltage applied on the homojunction is not the entire
V b . Another reason is that cleaving the sample cross-section would create shunts and decrease the shunt resistance, so the current under
V b
is larger than that of a non-cleaved device under the same bias voltage 48 , 49 . In addition, we also check for possible topographic effects. The topography of the cross-section is not very smooth because of the restriction of the sample preparation without further treatment. We choose two line-scan potential profiles whose locations are across large particles in topography maps (Supplementary Fig.  11 ). Although the topographic height changes significantly, the potential along the two lines appears to have an almost identical distribution, therefore suggesting minimal crosstalk between the topography and KPFM potential measurements (Supplementary Note  3 ). From the potential and field difference curves (Fig.  4e,f , respectively), the significant potential drops and the electric field enhancement are observed across the n-type/p-type perovskite interface. Moreover, the position of maximum electric field corresponds to the n-type/p-type perovskite boundary, indicating a junction at the interface. Due to the p–n junction characteristic, the potential change trends at the junction area are different under the forward and reverse
V b , and the electric field directions are also opposite under the forward and reverse
V b . Besides, we use the same method to measure the control device (FTO/TiO 2 /undoped perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au) (Supplementary Figs.  11
and
12 ). We observe a potential drop and a rise at the TiO 2 /perovskite and the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interfaces, respectively, at
V b  = 0. Under different bias voltages, two major electric fields are located across the two interfaces, which demonstrates that the control device works as a p–i–n junction as opposed to a homojunction device. The homojunction-enhanced solar cell performance To check the effects of the homojunction on the performance of PSCs, MAPbI 3 -based and FA 0.15 MA 0.85 PbI 3 -based perovskite layers are chosen for fabricating planar PSCs. The performances of PSCs with and without the homojunction are presented in Fig.  5 . First, we fabricate the MAPbI 3
homojunction PSCs. The top p-type perovskite layer is fabricated with a PbI 2
thickness of 60 nm followed by a dipping time of 60 s (that corresponds to a PbI 2 /MAI ratio of ~0.91) and the n-type perovskite layer (480 nm) is fabricated with a PbI 2 /MAI ratio of 1.10. The performance-optimized results with the PbI 2
thickness for the top p-type perovskite and the self-doping concentration for the bottom n-type perovskite can be found in Supplementary Fig.  13 . The perovskite layer in MAPbI 3
standard p–i–n PSCs is deposited by solution processing to a thickness of about 540 nm, similarly to that of the homojunction film as shown in Supplementary Fig.  1i,j . As shown in Fig.  5a , the performances of the champion MAPbI 3
PSCs with and without the homojunction are compared. The homojunction PSC exhibits a better performance than the standard p–i–n PSC with an increase in the PCE from 17.76% to 20.80%. Among the photovoltaic parameters, the short-circuit current density ( J SC ) shows the greatest improvement, increasing from 22.54 mA cm −2
to 23.86 mA cm −2 . To understand the reason behind the
J SC
increase, we measure the absorbance spectra of these perovskite films and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the corresponding PSCs. The absorption curves of these two perovskite films are similar, which indicates that the perovskite homojunction does not induce additional absorption (Supplementary Fig.  14a ). The EQE spectra and the corresponding integrated
J sc
estimated for the MAPbI 3
PSCs with and without the homojunction are shown in Supplementary Fig.  14b . The EQE of the homojunction PSC is higher than the standard p–i–n PSC, especially at long wavelengths (from 500 nm to 800 nm). The homojunction probably suppresses the carrier recombination. The integrated
J SC
matches well with the measured
J SC . Hence, the notable increase in
J SC ,
V OC
and fill factor (FF) of the homojunction PSC is mainly attributed to the effective oriented transport of photo-generated carriers induced by the built-in field of the homojunction, which minimizes the loss in the photovoltaic performance. A 20.5% efficiency for the MAPbI 3
homojunction PSCs is certified by the National Institute of Metrology in China (Supplementary Fig.  15 ). Fig. 5: Photovoltaic performance of the planar PSCs with and without the homojunction. a ,

curves for the champion FA 0.15 MA 0.85 PbI 3
homojunction PSC. Full size image Besides, the stabilized electric power output and the photocurrent density at the maximum power point are measured over a period of 200 s and shown in Fig.  5b . By holding a bias near the maximum power output point (+0.95 V), we obtained a stabilized PSC of ~20.6%, which is similar to the non-stabilized PCE of 20.80% measured for the same cell. As shown in Fig.  5c , the homojunction greatly improves the performance and reproducibility compared to the standard structure (other parameters are reported in Supplementary Fig.  16 ). The average PCE for 45 standard p–i–n PSCs is 15.92% with a
J sc
of 22.27 mA cm −2 ,
V oc
of 1.06 V and FF of 67.20%. For the 45 homojunction PSCs, the average PCE reaches up to 19.95% with an average
J sc
of 23.43 mA cm −2 ,
V oc
of 1.12 V and FF of 76.09%. Hysteresis has frequently been observed in PSCs, so its assessment is important to evaluate the performance of PSCs accurately. We perform serial forward/reverse scanned
J – V
measurements on one of the most efficient MAPbI 3
homojunction PSCs to examine the influence of the biasing history. We observe little difference between the
J – V
curves measured under reverse and forward scans (Supplementary Fig.  17 ), which indicates that the doping of the perovskite for the homojunction within the stoichiometry explored in this work does not lead to significant hysteresis. We obtained a mean PCE of 20.1% from 8 measurements (Supplementary Table  2 ), based on the averaged values of the reverse and forward scanned
J – V
curves with the MAPbI 3
homojunction PSC. The discrepancy in the PCEs derived from the two scanned direction curves (that is, reverse and forward) is only 0.7%, revealing that the homojunction PSCs have small hysteresis. To demonstrate the generalizability of the homojunction in PSCs, planar FA 0.15 MA 0.85 PbI 3
PSCs with and without the homojunction have been fabricated and tested. The
J – V
curves indicate that the performance of FA 0.15 MA 0.85 PbI 3
homojunction PSCs is improved markedly in terms of all the photovoltaic parameters as shown in Supplementary Fig.  18 . Notably, the champion FA 0.15 MA 0.85 PbI 3
homojunction PSC shows a PCE of 21.88% with an FF of up to 80.50% under reverse scanning and a PCE of 20.88% under forward scanning, leading to an average PCE of 21.38% (as shown in Fig.  5d ; the EQE and integrated
J sc
are shown in Supplementary Fig.  19 ). We demonstrated that the performances are significantly improved when using the homojunction structure for planar MAPbI 3
or FA 0.15 MA 0.85 PbI 3
PSCs. Moreover, the feasibility of the single-homojunction PSC without an HTL and an ETL for highly efficient PSCs is worth further study. Stability of the homojunction films and solar cells To study the stability of the homojunction, transmission electron microscope (TEM) studies are carried out to investigate the possible ion diffusion issue in the grain boundaries between the p-type and n-type perovskite layers. The whole PSC is cross-sectioned by means of a focused ion beam (FIB). Figure  6a–d
shows the cross-sectional PSCs of the standard p–i–n structure and the homojunction structure, respectively. The interface between the p-type and n-type perovskite layers is clearly visible as a neat boundary. To verify the stability of the homojunction, we store the homojunction PSC without encapsulation in ambient air under dark conditions for 160 h. In Fig.  6e,f , the interface between the p-type and n-type perovskite layers is still clearly visible after 160 h of storage compared with the fresh condition. Moreover, we mark the p-type perovskite layer with bromide and employ TEM with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis to inspect the ion migration in the homojunction (Supplementary Fig.  20 ). We note that little or no ion migration between the two types of perovskite layer after the PSC was measured under AM1.5 illumination and stored for 160 h. Therefore, the results suggest that the homojunction with self-doped perovskite layers is a stable structure under the conditions investigated.

g , Evolution of PCE relative to the initial parameters for PSCs without encapsulation stored in ambient air under dark conditions. Full size image The long-term stability of PSCs is studied to evaluate the effects of the homojunction. We examine the performance of unencapsulated PSCs stored in ambient air (25 °C and 40 ± 10% relative humidity) under dark conditions for 792 h. As shown in Fig.  6g , the evolution of the PCE over time reveals a similar trend for PSCs with and without the homojunction. The result shows that the PCE of a MAPbI 3
homojunction PSC decreased from 20.27% to 19.56%, which maintained 96% of the initial PCE after 792 h, whereas the PCE of a MAPbI 3
standard p–i–n PSC maintained 94% of the initial PCE (from 17.39% to 16.29%). This indicates that the homojunction PSCs are relatively stable even in the presence of moisture and oxygen, which are known to be critical factors in perovskite degradation. The FA 0.15 MA 0.85 PbI 3
homojunction PSC shows a marginal decrease in PCE, from 21.23% to 20.66%, after 792 h, thus retaining 97% of the initial PCE (other parameters shown in Supplementary Fig.  21 ). Hence, it is clear that the as-fabricated PSCs with the homojunction possess excellent long-term stability, which can be ascribed to the fact that the large grains of the n-type perovskite layer and the film compactness of the p-type perovskite layer can minimize the negative impact of oxygen and moisture. Conclusions In summary, we have demonstrated a perovskite homojunction structure to enhance the performance of planar PSCs using a p-type perovskite/n-type perovskite bilayer fabricated by a combined deposition method. The formation of the p–n junction in the homojunction structure has been verified by cross-sectional KPFM measurements under a series of bias voltages. The planar homojunction PCSs show an enhanced PCE with respect to standard p–i–n PSCs as a consequence of oriented charge transport and reduced carrier recombination. A certified efficiency exceeding 20% is achieved in the MAPbI 3
homojunction PSCs. Furthermore, FA 0.15 MA 0.85 PbI 3
homojunctions are investigated and integrated into PSCs, enabling efficiencies of up to 21.38%. This work demonstrates that the perovskite homojunction is a valid alternative approach to the p–i–n traditional heterojunction PSCs for fabricating highly efficient PSCs. Methods Preparation of the perovskite homojunction The perovskite homojunction is formed by n-type and p-type perovskite layers. To fabricate the n-type perovskite layer, a one-step spin-coating method was used as in previous published papers 39 , 40 . To prepare the perovskite precursor solution, 159 mg MAI (Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp.), and 462 mg 1.0 M, 485 mg 1.05 M, 508 mg 1.1 M and 531 mg 1.15 M PbI 2
were mixed in anhydrous dimethylformamide/dimethylsulphoxide (600 mg/78 mg) solution (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%), which was stirred at room temperature in a glove box. It was spin-coated directly on FTO/compact TiO 2
substrate at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. During the spin-coating step, 0.5 ml of diethyl ether was poured on the surface at 25 s before the end. The light-yellow transparent films were converted into brownish-red perovskite films by heating at 130 °C for 5 min. From this process, n-type perovskite films with various doping concentrations were obtained with PbI 2 /MAI ratios of 1, 1.05, 1.10 and 1.15. For depositing the p-type perovskite film on the n-type film, a new formation method combining evaporating and dipping processes was developed. PbI 2
films with thicknesses of 10 nm, 20 nm, 40 nm, 60 nm and 80 nm were evaporated directly on the surface of n-type perovskite films, respectively. Then, these films were dipped in 40 mg ml −1
MAI/isopropanol solution. After rinsing with isopropanol (Sigma-Aldrich), the prepared films were heated at 100 °C. We chose a PbI 2
thickness of 60 nm followed by a dipping time of 60 s, whose precursor ratio is measured at ~0.91 (PbI 2 /MAI). Then the perovskite homojunction formed by n-type and p-type perovskite films was obtained through the above process. PSC fabrication FTO glass substrates were cleaned by dust-free paper first, and then washed with deionized water, ethanol and acetone twice. Then the FTO substrates were dried by blowing with high-purity nitrogen. A compact TiO 2
layer with a thickness of approximately 20 nm was fabricated on FTO by TiCl 4
treatment at 70 °C for 60 min as shown in previous papers 29 , 39 , 46 . After drying in a drying oven at 50 °C for 2 h, the perovskite homojunction was deposited directly on these substrates by the process mentioned above. The hole transport layer (150 nm) was obtained by spin-coating the 2,20,7,70-tetrakis[ N , N -di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,90-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) solution (80 mg ml −1
dissolved in chlorobenzene, Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp.) with the standard additives tertbutylpyridine (28.5 μl in 1 ml chlorobenzene) and lithiumbis-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (8.75 mg ml −1 ) at a speed of 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s in a glove box, followed by oxidation in clean air for 6 h. After that, the Au electrode with a thickness of 100 nm was prepared by the vacuum evaporation equipment. Perovskite film characterization The morphologies of the as-prepared MAPbI 3
films were characterized by SEM (Hitachi S-4800). The chemical compositions and structures of the perovskite films were analysed by X-ray diffraction (Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer, Cu-Kα radiation
λ  = 0.15406 nm). The valence spectra were measured by XPS (ESCSLAB 250Xi). All spectra were shifted to account for sample charging using inorganic carbon at 284.80 eV as a reference. The static PL spectra of the perovskite films on FTO substrates were measured by an Edinburgh PLS 980. TRPL decay was measured using a transient-state spectrophotometer (Edinburgh Ins. F900) under the irradiation of a 485 nm pulse laser. Hall The sample was characterized using a Nanometrics HL5500 Hall System. An 80 nm gold layer was thermally evaporated onto the perovskite films to serve as metal contacts. All of the measurements were performed at room temperature (25 °C) and aphotic conditions. Other condition parameters are as follows: the current measuring range is 10 pA (d.c.), and the magnetic field is 0.503 T. PSC characterization Current–voltage curves were measured using a source meter (Keithley 2400) under AM1.5G irradiation with a power density of 100 mW cm −2
from a solar simulator (XES-301S+EL-100) by forward (−0.1 V to 1.2 V) or reverse (1.2 V to −0.1 V) scans. The step voltage was fixed at 12 mV and the delay time was set at 10 ms. The light intensity was calibrated by a standard silicon cell (the KG-5 mono-Si cell). All of the PSCs had no encapsulation and were tested in ambient air (25 °C, ~40% humidity) and employed a mask with an aperture area of 0.07 cm 2 . The EQE was measured using QE-R systems (Enli Tech.). PSC simulation PSC simulation was carried out using wxAMPS software, based on the standard p–i–n PSC, FTO/TiO 2
(20 nm)/undoped perovskite (540 nm)/spiro-OMeTAD (200 nm)/Au, and the homojunction PSC, FTO/TiO 2
(20 nm)/n-type perovskite (480 nm)/p-type perovskite (60 nm)/spiro-OMeTAD (200 nm)/Au. The doping concentrations, mobility and other properties of the materials are reported in Supplementary Tables  3
and
4 . AFM and KPFM The surface AFM and KPFM were carried out using an Agilent SPM 5500 with the sample chamber filled with high-purity N 2 . The cross-sectional AFM and KPFM were carried out using an Asylum Research MFP3d with the sample chamber filled with high-purity N 2 . For the cross-sectional KPFM measurements, the devices were cleaved to expose the cross-section from the film side, and no further treatment. We cut a notch at the side of the substrate (outside the active area of the solar cells) using a diamond cutter, and fractured the device by tension rather than by compression to expose the cross-section. The sample was fixed in a custom-made vertical sample holder with electrical connections to both electrodes. The FTO layer of the device was grounded. The measurement was carried out in the dark. The potential images were recorded in tapping mode using a conductive PtSi-FM probe (NANOSENSORS, Pt-coated Si with a frequency of ~75 KHz and a nominal tip radius of ~25 nm). Amplitude-modulation KPFM measurements were carried out. The contact potential difference (CPD) between the probe and the sample was measured simultaneously with the topographic signal by the single-pass mode. The CPD signals reflect the potential distribution of the sample surface, as the workfunction of the probe is constant during the measurement. The topographic height was obtained by maintaining the amplitude of the first cantilever resonance (~71 kHz). To separate topographic from CPD signals, increase the accuracy and minimize probe convolution effects, the a.c. electrostatic force component was generated at the second resonance (~420 kHz) of the cantilever by applying a small a.c. voltage of 0.5 V. The scan rate was 0.6 Hz. KPFM measurements were performed under different bias voltages ( V b ) from +0.5 to −1.0 V on the same area of the cross-section of the device. The
V b
was applied to the device using a Keithley 2400 source meter. The ion migration had no significant effect on the potential distributions during the KPFM scanning with the
V b
from −1 V to +0.5 V within 20 min. We applied the
V b
for 2 min, and then started testing for a stable result. The electric field profiles were obtained by taking the first derivative of the potential profiles. As a small change in noise level potential would tremendously enhance the electric field profiles, the raw data must be smoothed before taking the derivative. TEM The cross-sectional morphologies of the full cells and interface characterization of the homojunction were investigated using a high-resolution TEM. The samples were prepared by vertical etching using FIB equipment (FEI Helios Nanolab 600i). The cross-sectional surface was in situ-coated with platinum using an FEI gas injection system to protect the surface from damage during FIB milling. A cross-sectional specimen approximately 80 nm in thickness was obtained. Then the images were obtained using a high-resolution TEM (FEI Titan G2) at an acceleration voltage of 300 kV.

Abstract Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as an attractive photovoltaic technology thanks to their outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE). Further improvement in the device efficiency is limited by the recombination of the charge carriers in the perovskite layer even when employing heterojunction-based architectures. Here, we propose and demonstrate a p-type perovskite/n-type perovskite homojunction whose built-in electric field promotes oriented transport of the photo-induced carriers, thus reducing carrier recombination losses. By controlling the stoichiometry of the perovskite precursors, we are able to induce n-type or p-type doping. We integrate the homojunction structure in a planar PSC combining a thermally evaporated p-type perovskite layer on a solution-processed n-type perovskite layer. The PSC with a MAPbI 3
homojunction achieves a PCE of 20.80% (20.5% certified PCE), whereas the PSC based on a FA 0.15 MA 0.85 PbI 3
homojunction delivers a PCE of 21.38%. We demonstrate that the homojunction structure is an effective approach, beyond existing planar heterojunction PSCs, to achieve highly efficient PSCs with reduced carrier recombination losses.

Main Organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much interest thanks to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , which has increased from 3.8% up to 23.7% in less than 10 years 6 , 7 , facile processing methods 8 , 9
and outstanding optoelectronic properties 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 . Many effective strategies have been implemented to improve the performance of PSCs, such as solvent engineering 16 , 17 , 18 , compositional engineering 19 , 20
and alternative architecture design 21 , 22 , 23 . In particular, recent works 24 , 25 , 26 , 27
show that minimizing the carrier recombination losses, both in the perovskite layer and at the interfaces between different layers, enables a PCE closer to the theoretical value 1 . One strategy for reducing carrier recombination losses is to minimize defects on polycrystalline perovskite films 5 , 24 , 26 . For instance, additional iodide ions can be introduced into the organic cation solution, which decrease the concentration of the deep-level defects 5 . Another strategy is to engineer the device architecture employing mesoporous, planar or embedded structures to reduce the carrier losses during charge transport/extraction in PSCs 22 , 28 , 29 . Furthermore, the use of a bulk heterojunction active layer has been demonstrated to shorten the carrier transport distance in the perovskite films, thus reducing carrier losses 23 , 30 , 31 . Moreover, to decrease further the recombination losses and to improve the photoelectron collection, an inverted device architecture with a graded heterojunction structure has also been reported 32 . These results illustrate that improving the device architecture in heterojunction PSCs is a valid approach to decrease the carrier losses. While the heterojunction is constituted between the perovskite and electron/hole transport materials, the perovskite itself is also able to form a homojunction thanks to its unique self-doping property 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , which would minimize the presence of impurities that can act as carrier recombination centres 38 . Within the perovskite homojunction, a built-in electric field is formed that could enhance the oriented transport of the photo-induced electrons/holes, thus decreasing further carrier recombination in the perovskite layer. Therefore, it is a promising route to further improve the performances of PSCs. Here, we fabricate a perovskite p–n homojunction structure, via a combined deposition processing method, which is then integrated into planar PSCs. The built-in electric field in the homojunction, identified by cross-sectional Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), induces the oriented transport of the photo-induced carriers, thus reducing the carrier recombination losses as further corroborated by wxAMPs simulations. Planar PSCs with a MAPbI 3
(MA, methylammonium) p–n homojunction exhibit a steady-state efficiency of 20.80%. Furthermore, an average PCE of 21.38% is achieved by utilizing a FA 0.15 MA 0.85 PbI 3
(FA, formamidinium) p–n homojunction, exceeding the previously reported efficiency for planar PSCs. Fabrication of the planar homojunction PSC The proposed homojunction structure is composed of two perovskite layers with different doping, p-type and n-type perovskites, placed in junction with one another. A built-in electric field is therefore established at the p–n junction. Theoretical simulations and experimental evidence show that perovskites can be either p-type or n-type depending on the growth conditions and the ratio of the main precursors 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 . The MAPbI 3
films with Pb 2+ -rich/MA + -deficient/I − -deficient precursors are n-doped and those with MA + -rich/Pb 2+ -deficient precursors are p-doped, due to the presence of the defects induced by vacancies or interstitial elements. Previously, we have demonstrated that self-doping in perovskites can be tuned serially by controlling the process conditions, such as annealing temperatures 39 , 40 . Hence, it is feasible to fabricate a perovskite homojunction structure. We integrate the homojunction into PSCs based on the standard planar p–i–n 41 , 42
structure (Au/spiro-OMeTAD/MAPbI 3 /compact TiO 2 /fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)). Schematic illustrations of PSCs with the standard p–i–n structure and the homojunction structure are displayed in Fig.  1a,b . Figure  1c
presents a cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a homojunction PSC, where a smooth and uniform n-type MAPbI 3
layer can be clearly observed. Meanwhile, the dense and small-grain p-type MAPbI 3
layer with a thickness of ~60 nm is deposited on the top of the ~480 nm n-type MAPbI 3
layer. Fig. 1: Structure of planar PSCs with and without the homojunction and fabrication schematic of the homojunction PSC fabricated by the combined deposition method. a , The standard p–i–n PSC without the homojunction.
b , The PSC with the homojunction composed by p-type and n-type perovskite layers.
c , A cross-sectional SEM image of a homojunction PSC. The thicknesses of the TiO 2 , n-type perovskite, p-type perovskite, spiro-OMeTAD and Au electrode are about 20 nm, 480 nm, 60 nm, 200 nm and 100 nm, respectively.
d , The bottom n-type perovskite layer is deposited by a one-step spin-coating method. The top p-type perovskite layer is deposited by vacuum vapour deposition followed by a dipping process. Full size image To realize the perovskite homojunction structure, we propose a combined deposition method that combines a one-step spin-coating method for the deposition of the bottom n-type perovskite layer on top of the TiO 2
compact layer and a vacuum vapour deposition followed by a dipping step for the deposition of the top p-type perovskite layer over the n-type perovskite layer. The one-step spin-coating method allows control of the morphology, coverage, roughness and grain size of the n-type perovskite film. By varying the stoichiometry of the PbI 2 /MAI precursor ratio (1, 1.05, 1.10 and 1.15, respectively), we are able to induce the n-type doping in the perovskite. The deposition of the top p-type perovskite layer of the homojunction should not degrade the bottom n-type perovskite layer. While spin-coating would dissolve the bottom layer, vacuum vapour deposition has been reported to avoid damage of the organic/inorganic thin films underneath while enabling high-quality films 22 , 43 , 44 . We therefore choose this technique for depositing PbI 2
thin films on top of the n-type perovskite layer, followed by a dipping step in MAI/isopropanol solution to form MAPbI 3 . By adjusting the dipping time, we control the amount of MAI and thus the p-type doping. Finally, we choose the top p-type perovskite layer with a PbI 2
thickness of 60 nm followed by a dipping time of 60 s, whose precursor ratio is measured at ~0.91 (PbI 2 /MAI). The SEM images, X-ray diffraction patterns and high-resolution transmission electron microscope images (Supplementary Note  1 ) of perovskite layers are shown in Supplementary Figs.  1 – 3 , respectively. Carrier generation and recombination in homojunction PSC Figure  2a
shows a schematic energy level diagram and the working principle of the homojunction PSC and how carriers are transported across the layers. As photons are absorbed by both the p-type and n-type perovskites, the photo-induced carriers are generated in two perovskite layers. Then, the electrons and holes at the homojunction drift in opposite directions. Finally, the electrons are injected into the compact TiO 2
layer, the electron transport layer (ETL), and transported to the FTO cathode whereas the holes are injected into the spiro-OMeTAD layer, the hole transport layer (HTL), and transported to the Au anode.

Electrons (red circles) are transported through the n-type perovskite and collected at the FTO electrode.

The blue circles indicate electrons and the yellow circles indicate holes. The HTL and the ETL are shown in orange and blue, respectively.
c , Simulated generation and recombination rates of the photo-induced carriers across PSCs on illumination (AM1.5G) and under short-circuit conditions. The position refers to the cross-sections of the homojunction PSC, TiO 2
(20 nm)/n-type perovskite (480 nm)/p-type perovskite (60 nm)/spiro-OMeTAD (200 nm), and the standard p–i–n PSC, TiO 2
(20 nm)/undoped perovskite (540 nm)/spiro-OMeTAD (200 nm), respectively. The dashed blue lines are used to identify the layers in the PSCs. Full size image In PSCs with the standard p–i–n structure, the carrier transport in the perovskite film has no preferred direction, which can lead to unwanted carrier recombination. The extraction of photo-induced electrons and holes mostly occurs at the perovskite/ETL and the perovskite/HTL interfaces, respectively 27 . Hence, we design the homojunction structure to provide an extra built-in electric field in the perovskite film, in which electrons and holes move in opposite directions towards the ETL and the HTL, respectively, as shown in Fig.  2b , with a view to reducing carrier recombination. To verify the reduction in carrier recombination losses, carrier generation and recombination in PSCs is simulated with wxAMPS, which has been used to simulate thin-film solar cells 39 , 45 , 46 . The simulated structures for these two PSCs are shown in Supplementary Fig.  4a . In Fig.  2c , under short-circuit conditions, the rates of carrier generation are similar for both devices whereas the carrier recombination rate for PSCs with the homojunction is dramatically reduced near the p-type/n-type perovskite interface. We suggest that this is due to the electric field (Supplementary Fig.  4b ) induced by the homojunction that favours the oriented transport of electrons and holes. As a result of the influence of the homojunction, the concentration of the free holes increases in the p-type perovskite region away from the interface, whereas the concentration of the electrons decreases (Supplementary Fig.  4c,d ), providing evidence for carrier oriented transport. Besides, the simulated photocurrent density–voltage
(J – V)
curve (Supplementary Fig.  5
and Supplementary Note  2 ) in the homojunction PSC shows an obvious enhancement in open-circuit voltage ( V OC ). Optoelectronic properties of the perovskite homojunction To detect the doping property of as-prepared perovskite films, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) is carried out on perovskite films with various contents of PbI 2
in precursor solution. The valence spectra and the schematic energy level of the perovskite films are shown in Fig.  3a,b . The energy difference between the valence band and the Fermi level ( E F ) is 0.50 eV for the top p-type perovskite film with a PbI 2 /MAI ratio of 0.91, which confirms the p-type doping due to the perovskite’s bandgap of 1.55 eV. For the perovskite films containing excess PbI 2 , the
E F
is shifted close to the conduction band, with the increase in PbI 2
content in the precursor solution. This illustrates that the doping of the perovskite can be tuned from p-type to n-type by changing the PbI 2
content in the precursor solution. The full XPS spectra of the MAPbI 3
films are shown in Supplementary Fig.  6 . The position of the XPS peaks, especially for I and Pb, does not vary across the samples, thus indicating that the changes in the valence spectra are due to the perovskite materials, not measurement errors. The doping of the films is also characterized by Hall effect measurements. As shown in Fig.  3c
and Supplementary Table  1 , the carrier transport type converts from p-type to heavily n-type with increasing molar ratios of PbI 2 . Fig. 3: Doping, carrier transport and optical properties of the doped perovskite films. a , XPS valence spectra of MAPbI 3
films with different molar ratios of PbI 2 /MAI. The ratio of 0.91 indicates the p-type perovskite whereas the ratios of 1.05 and 1.1 indicate n-type perovskites.

d , e , Surface potential maps (KPFM) of MAPbI 3
films; low surface potentials are found for the p-type perovskite with a PbI 2 /MAI ratio of 0.91 ( d ) whereas high surface potentials are found for the n-type perovskite with a PbI 2 /MAI ratio of 1.15 ( e ); the topography maps (AFM) of these two films are shown in the insets. The colour scale bar of the KPFM indicates the relative scale of the surface potential. The blue and black lines across the images ( d , e ) mark the locations to extract the potential profiles in

and
τ 2 ) corresponding to the fast and slow decay component of these two films are estimated by fitting the TRPL decay curves and reported in the inset table.
h , Steady PL spectra of n-type perovskite film (black line) and homojunction film (n-type perovskite/p-type perovskite, red line). In
g , h , the n-type perovskite is from the PbI 2 /MAI ratio of 1.15, whereas the p-type perovskite is from the PbI 2 /MAI ratio of 0.91. Full size image In addition, KPFM, which is employed to characterize the surface potentials, also confirms the results presented above. Figure  3d,e
shows KPFM potential images of the p-type perovskite films with a PbI 2 /MAI ratio of 0.91 and the n-type perovskite with a PbI 2 /MAI ratio of 1.15 (other ratios are reported in Supplementary Fig.  7 ), respectively, whereas the insets show the atomic force microscope (AFM) topographic images. It can be seen from Fig.  3d
that the surface potential of the p-type perovskite film is lower than that of the n-type perovskite film (Fig.  3e ), because of accumulated holes that lead the Fermi level to be located close to the valence band 39 . Contrarily, the higher surface potential of the n-type perovskite film shown in Fig.  3e
correlates with the n-type doping of the sample, which is consistent with the XPS and Hall results. To get a quantitative comparison, the profiles of the surface potentials of the films are compared in Fig.  3f . The surface potential on the n-type perovskite film is approximately 0.1 V whereas that of the p-type perovskite film is about −0.3 V. The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and the steady PL measurements are performed for the single n-type perovskite film (PbI 2 /MAI ratio of 1.15) and the perovskite homojunction film (n-type layer with a PbI 2 /MAI ratio of 1.15 and p-type layer with PbI 2 /MAI ratio of 0.91). As shown in Fig.  3g , TRPL decay of perovskite films showed a bi-exponential decay with a fast and a slow component. The bimolecular recombination rate,
a , and the decay lifetime,
τ , are estimated by fitting the decay curves with the expressions
I   =   I 0 (1  +   at ) −2
and
I   =   I 0  × exp(−( t / τ ) β ), respectively, and reported in the inset table of Fig.  3g . Previous studies of carrier recombination in perovskite films suggest that the fast decay process is caused by bimolecular recombination of photo-generated free carriers, whereas the slow decay process is attributed mainly to trap-assisted recombination 26 , 39 . Here, the perovskite homojunction film possesses a higher bimolecular recombination rate ( a  = 2.9 × 10 8  s −1 ) and a shorter fast decay lifetime (τ 1  = 6.3 ns) than the n-type perovskite film while the slow decay lifetime ( τ 2 ) is similar in the two samples. This indicates that efficient carrier transfer occurs between the two type perovskite layers in the homojunction without introducing more traps in the homojunction, possibly because of the built-in field at the p–n junction. PL spectra of these two films are consistent with the results of TRPL. As shown in Fig.  3h , the intensity of PL for the perovskite homojunction film is quenched by over 80% relative to that of the single n-type perovskite film, proving the efficient oriented transport of carriers between the n-type and p-type perovskite layers of the homojunction induced by the built-in potential, which can potentially enable higher performances in PSCs. Evidence for the perovskite p–n homojunction formation To further verify the formation of the p–n junction between the two perovskite layers, KPFM measurements have been performed on the cross-section of the homojunction structure under dark conditions, which can be used to study the electrical potential distribution across the internal interfaces in solar cells 37 , 47 , 48 , 49 . A schematic of the KPFM measurement principle is shown in Supplementary Fig.  8 . We fabricate the homojunction device based on FTO/n-type perovskite/p-type perovskite/Au and we cleave it to expose the cross-section without applying any treatments (for example, polishing or ion milling) to avoid complications and artefacts. Moreover, to exclude the influence of surface charges (defects) created on the cleaved cross-sectional surface, we employ a method for measuring the potential changes based on a series of bias voltages ( V b ) that are sufficiently small (from the −1.0 V to +0.5 V) 48 , 49 . We can obtain the obvious potential change caused by the transport and extraction of carriers at the junction, because the configuration of surface charges trapped at defects would not change significantly with such a small V b
(ref.
48 ). Figure  4a,b
shows the AFM topography of the homojunction device and the corresponding KPFM potential image at
V b  = 0, respectively. As shown in the potential profile in Fig.  4c , a potential drop is observed at the interface of the n-type/p-type perovskite layers caused by the carrier transport at the interface. This demonstrates the existence of a built-in electric field and thus the existence of the p–n junction. Besides, the dark and photoelectric
J – V
curves of homojunction devices show the typical rectifying characteristic of the p–n junction (Supplementary Fig.  9 ). Remarkably, this simple homojunction device composed of two perovskite layers and relative electrodes but without an HTL and an ETL exhibits a PCE of up to 8.08%, corroborating the presence of the p–n junction.

are averaged from the potential images along the device lateral direction. The potential differences in

are obtained by subtracting the potential under
V b  = 0 from the potentials under the various
V b . The profiles of the electric field difference in
f
are deduced by taking a derivative of the potential differences in
e . The device structure is FTO/homojunction (n-type perovskite/p-type perovskite)/Au. The dashed grey lines are used to identify the layers in the device in
c – f . Furthermore, FTO (grounded) and Au are connected to a voltage source to realize different bias voltages ( V b ) to the device. Full size image To obtain accurate information about the bulk property by cross-sectional potential measurements, we measured the potential changes on the same area induced by applying various
V b
(Supplementary Fig.  10 ). The averaged line profiles of the potential under different
V b
are shown in Fig.  4d . We subtract the
V b  = 0 potential profile from the −1.0 V (reverse) up to the +0.5 V (forward) potential profiles, calculate the potential difference curves at the various
V b
(Fig.  4e ) and then take the first derivative of the curves to obtain electrical field differences (Fig.  4f ). In Fig.  4d , we note that the potential in the FTO changes slightly with the different
V b , even though the FTO is grounded. One reason could be the non-negligible resistance of FTO (~16 Ω sq −1 ) and the contact resistance (~2 Ω), which act as series resistors with a voltage drop across them. Hence, the actual voltage applied on the homojunction is not the entire
V b . Another reason is that cleaving the sample cross-section would create shunts and decrease the shunt resistance, so the current under
V b
is larger than that of a non-cleaved device under the same bias voltage 48 , 49 . In addition, we also check for possible topographic effects. The topography of the cross-section is not very smooth because of the restriction of the sample preparation without further treatment. We choose two line-scan potential profiles whose locations are across large particles in topography maps (Supplementary Fig.  11 ). Although the topographic height changes significantly, the potential along the two lines appears to have an almost identical distribution, therefore suggesting minimal crosstalk between the topography and KPFM potential measurements (Supplementary Note  3 ). From the potential and field difference curves (Fig.  4e,f , respectively), the significant potential drops and the electric field enhancement are observed across the n-type/p-type perovskite interface. Moreover, the position of maximum electric field corresponds to the n-type/p-type perovskite boundary, indicating a junction at the interface. Due to the p–n junction characteristic, the potential change trends at the junction area are different under the forward and reverse
V b , and the electric field directions are also opposite under the forward and reverse
V b . Besides, we use the same method to measure the control device (FTO/TiO 2 /undoped perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au) (Supplementary Figs.  11
and
12 ). We observe a potential drop and a rise at the TiO 2 /perovskite and the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interfaces, respectively, at
V b  = 0. Under different bias voltages, two major electric fields are located across the two interfaces, which demonstrates that the control device works as a p–i–n junction as opposed to a homojunction device. The homojunction-enhanced solar cell performance To check the effects of the homojunction on the performance of PSCs, MAPbI 3 -based and FA 0.15 MA 0.85 PbI 3 -based perovskite layers are chosen for fabricating planar PSCs. The performances of PSCs with and without the homojunction are presented in Fig.  5 . First, we fabricate the MAPbI 3
homojunction PSCs. The top p-type perovskite layer is fabricated with a PbI 2
thickness of 60 nm followed by a dipping time of 60 s (that corresponds to a PbI 2 /MAI ratio of ~0.91) and the n-type perovskite layer (480 nm) is fabricated with a PbI 2 /MAI ratio of 1.10. The performance-optimized results with the PbI 2
thickness for the top p-type perovskite and the self-doping concentration for the bottom n-type perovskite can be found in Supplementary Fig.  13 . The perovskite layer in MAPbI 3
standard p–i–n PSCs is deposited by solution processing to a thickness of about 540 nm, similarly to that of the homojunction film as shown in Supplementary Fig.  1i,j . As shown in Fig.  5a , the performances of the champion MAPbI 3
PSCs with and without the homojunction are compared. The homojunction PSC exhibits a better performance than the standard p–i–n PSC with an increase in the PCE from 17.76% to 20.80%. Among the photovoltaic parameters, the short-circuit current density ( J SC ) shows the greatest improvement, increasing from 22.54 mA cm −2
to 23.86 mA cm −2 . To understand the reason behind the
J SC
increase, we measure the absorbance spectra of these perovskite films and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the corresponding PSCs. The absorption curves of these two perovskite films are similar, which indicates that the perovskite homojunction does not induce additional absorption (Supplementary Fig.  14a ). The EQE spectra and the corresponding integrated
J sc
estimated for the MAPbI 3
PSCs with and without the homojunction are shown in Supplementary Fig.  14b . The EQE of the homojunction PSC is higher than the standard p–i–n PSC, especially at long wavelengths (from 500 nm to 800 nm). The homojunction probably suppresses the carrier recombination. The integrated
J SC
matches well with the measured
J SC . Hence, the notable increase in
J SC ,
V OC
and fill factor (FF) of the homojunction PSC is mainly attributed to the effective oriented transport of photo-generated carriers induced by the built-in field of the homojunction, which minimizes the loss in the photovoltaic performance. A 20.5% efficiency for the MAPbI 3
homojunction PSCs is certified by the National Institute of Metrology in China (Supplementary Fig.  15 ). Fig. 5: Photovoltaic performance of the planar PSCs with and without the homojunction. a ,

curves for the champion FA 0.15 MA 0.85 PbI 3
homojunction PSC. Full size image Besides, the stabilized electric power output and the photocurrent density at the maximum power point are measured over a period of 200 s and shown in Fig.  5b . By holding a bias near the maximum power output point (+0.95 V), we obtained a stabilized PSC of ~20.6%, which is similar to the non-stabilized PCE of 20.80% measured for the same cell. As shown in Fig.  5c , the homojunction greatly improves the performance and reproducibility compared to the standard structure (other parameters are reported in Supplementary Fig.  16 ). The average PCE for 45 standard p–i–n PSCs is 15.92% with a
J sc
of 22.27 mA cm −2 ,
V oc
of 1.06 V and FF of 67.20%. For the 45 homojunction PSCs, the average PCE reaches up to 19.95% with an average
J sc
of 23.43 mA cm −2 ,
V oc
of 1.12 V and FF of 76.09%. Hysteresis has frequently been observed in PSCs, so its assessment is important to evaluate the performance of PSCs accurately. We perform serial forward/reverse scanned
J – V
measurements on one of the most efficient MAPbI 3
homojunction PSCs to examine the influence of the biasing history. We observe little difference between the
J – V
curves measured under reverse and forward scans (Supplementary Fig.  17 ), which indicates that the doping of the perovskite for the homojunction within the stoichiometry explored in this work does not lead to significant hysteresis. We obtained a mean PCE of 20.1% from 8 measurements (Supplementary Table  2 ), based on the averaged values of the reverse and forward scanned
J – V
curves with the MAPbI 3
homojunction PSC. The discrepancy in the PCEs derived from the two scanned direction curves (that is, reverse and forward) is only 0.7%, revealing that the homojunction PSCs have small hysteresis. To demonstrate the generalizability of the homojunction in PSCs, planar FA 0.15 MA 0.85 PbI 3
PSCs with and without the homojunction have been fabricated and tested. The
J – V
curves indicate that the performance of FA 0.15 MA 0.85 PbI 3
homojunction PSCs is improved markedly in terms of all the photovoltaic parameters as shown in Supplementary Fig.  18 . Notably, the champion FA 0.15 MA 0.85 PbI 3
homojunction PSC shows a PCE of 21.88% with an FF of up to 80.50% under reverse scanning and a PCE of 20.88% under forward scanning, leading to an average PCE of 21.38% (as shown in Fig.  5d ; the EQE and integrated
J sc
are shown in Supplementary Fig.  19 ). We demonstrated that the performances are significantly improved when using the homojunction structure for planar MAPbI 3
or FA 0.15 MA 0.85 PbI 3
PSCs. Moreover, the feasibility of the single-homojunction PSC without an HTL and an ETL for highly efficient PSCs is worth further study. Stability of the homojunction films and solar cells To study the stability of the homojunction, transmission electron microscope (TEM) studies are carried out to investigate the possible ion diffusion issue in the grain boundaries between the p-type and n-type perovskite layers. The whole PSC is cross-sectioned by means of a focused ion beam (FIB). Figure  6a–d
shows the cross-sectional PSCs of the standard p–i–n structure and the homojunction structure, respectively. The interface between the p-type and n-type perovskite layers is clearly visible as a neat boundary. To verify the stability of the homojunction, we store the homojunction PSC without encapsulation in ambient air under dark conditions for 160 h. In Fig.  6e,f , the interface between the p-type and n-type perovskite layers is still clearly visible after 160 h of storage compared with the fresh condition. Moreover, we mark the p-type perovskite layer with bromide and employ TEM with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis to inspect the ion migration in the homojunction (Supplementary Fig.  20 ). We note that little or no ion migration between the two types of perovskite layer after the PSC was measured under AM1.5 illumination and stored for 160 h. Therefore, the results suggest that the homojunction with self-doped perovskite layers is a stable structure under the conditions investigated.

g , Evolution of PCE relative to the initial parameters for PSCs without encapsulation stored in ambient air under dark conditions. Full size image The long-term stability of PSCs is studied to evaluate the effects of the homojunction. We examine the performance of unencapsulated PSCs stored in ambient air (25 °C and 40 ± 10% relative humidity) under dark conditions for 792 h. As shown in Fig.  6g , the evolution of the PCE over time reveals a similar trend for PSCs with and without the homojunction. The result shows that the PCE of a MAPbI 3
homojunction PSC decreased from 20.27% to 19.56%, which maintained 96% of the initial PCE after 792 h, whereas the PCE of a MAPbI 3
standard p–i–n PSC maintained 94% of the initial PCE (from 17.39% to 16.29%). This indicates that the homojunction PSCs are relatively stable even in the presence of moisture and oxygen, which are known to be critical factors in perovskite degradation. The FA 0.15 MA 0.85 PbI 3
homojunction PSC shows a marginal decrease in PCE, from 21.23% to 20.66%, after 792 h, thus retaining 97% of the initial PCE (other parameters shown in Supplementary Fig.  21 ). Hence, it is clear that the as-fabricated PSCs with the homojunction possess excellent long-term stability, which can be ascribed to the fact that the large grains of the n-type perovskite layer and the film compactness of the p-type perovskite layer can minimize the negative impact of oxygen and moisture. Conclusions In summary, we have demonstrated a perovskite homojunction structure to enhance the performance of planar PSCs using a p-type perovskite/n-type perovskite bilayer fabricated by a combined deposition method. The formation of the p–n junction in the homojunction structure has been verified by cross-sectional KPFM measurements under a series of bias voltages. The planar homojunction PCSs show an enhanced PCE with respect to standard p–i–n PSCs as a consequence of oriented charge transport and reduced carrier recombination. A certified efficiency exceeding 20% is achieved in the MAPbI 3
homojunction PSCs. Furthermore, FA 0.15 MA 0.85 PbI 3
homojunctions are investigated and integrated into PSCs, enabling efficiencies of up to 21.38%. This work demonstrates that the perovskite homojunction is a valid alternative approach to the p–i–n traditional heterojunction PSCs for fabricating highly efficient PSCs. Methods Preparation of the perovskite homojunction The perovskite homojunction is formed by n-type and p-type perovskite layers. To fabricate the n-type perovskite layer, a one-step spin-coating method was used as in previous published papers 39 , 40 . To prepare the perovskite precursor solution, 159 mg MAI (Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp.), and 462 mg 1.0 M, 485 mg 1.05 M, 508 mg 1.1 M and 531 mg 1.15 M PbI 2
were mixed in anhydrous dimethylformamide/dimethylsulphoxide (600 mg/78 mg) solution (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%), which was stirred at room temperature in a glove box. It was spin-coated directly on FTO/compact TiO 2
substrate at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. During the spin-coating step, 0.5 ml of diethyl ether was poured on the surface at 25 s before the end. The light-yellow transparent films were converted into brownish-red perovskite films by heating at 130 °C for 5 min. From this process, n-type perovskite films with various doping concentrations were obtained with PbI 2 /MAI ratios of 1, 1.05, 1.10 and 1.15. For depositing the p-type perovskite film on the n-type film, a new formation method combining evaporating and dipping processes was developed. PbI 2
films with thicknesses of 10 nm, 20 nm, 40 nm, 60 nm and 80 nm were evaporated directly on the surface of n-type perovskite films, respectively. Then, these films were dipped in 40 mg ml −1
MAI/isopropanol solution. After rinsing with isopropanol (Sigma-Aldrich), the prepared films were heated at 100 °C. We chose a PbI 2
thickness of 60 nm followed by a dipping time of 60 s, whose precursor ratio is measured at ~0.91 (PbI 2 /MAI). Then the perovskite homojunction formed by n-type and p-type perovskite films was obtained through the above process. PSC fabrication FTO glass substrates were cleaned by dust-free paper first, and then washed with deionized water, ethanol and acetone twice. Then the FTO substrates were dried by blowing with high-purity nitrogen. A compact TiO 2
layer with a thickness of approximately 20 nm was fabricated on FTO by TiCl 4
treatment at 70 °C for 60 min as shown in previous papers 29 , 39 , 46 . After drying in a drying oven at 50 °C for 2 h, the perovskite homojunction was deposited directly on these substrates by the process mentioned above. The hole transport layer (150 nm) was obtained by spin-coating the 2,20,7,70-tetrakis[ N , N -di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,90-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) solution (80 mg ml −1
dissolved in chlorobenzene, Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp.) with the standard additives tertbutylpyridine (28.5 μl in 1 ml chlorobenzene) and lithiumbis-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (8.75 mg ml −1 ) at a speed of 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s in a glove box, followed by oxidation in clean air for 6 h. After that, the Au electrode with a thickness of 100 nm was prepared by the vacuum evaporation equipment. Perovskite film characterization The morphologies of the as-prepared MAPbI 3
films were characterized by SEM (Hitachi S-4800). The chemical compositions and structures of the perovskite films were analysed by X-ray diffraction (Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer, Cu-Kα radiation
λ  = 0.15406 nm). The valence spectra were measured by XPS (ESCSLAB 250Xi). All spectra were shifted to account for sample charging using inorganic carbon at 284.80 eV as a reference. The static PL spectra of the perovskite films on FTO substrates were measured by an Edinburgh PLS 980. TRPL decay was measured using a transient-state spectrophotometer (Edinburgh Ins. F900) under the irradiation of a 485 nm pulse laser. Hall The sample was characterized using a Nanometrics HL5500 Hall System. An 80 nm gold layer was thermally evaporated onto the perovskite films to serve as metal contacts. All of the measurements were performed at room temperature (25 °C) and aphotic conditions. Other condition parameters are as follows: the current measuring range is 10 pA (d.c.), and the magnetic field is 0.503 T. PSC characterization Current–voltage curves were measured using a source meter (Keithley 2400) under AM1.5G irradiation with a power density of 100 mW cm −2
from a solar simulator (XES-301S+EL-100) by forward (−0.1 V to 1.2 V) or reverse (1.2 V to −0.1 V) scans. The step voltage was fixed at 12 mV and the delay time was set at 10 ms. The light intensity was calibrated by a standard silicon cell (the KG-5 mono-Si cell). All of the PSCs had no encapsulation and were tested in ambient air (25 °C, ~40% humidity) and employed a mask with an aperture area of 0.07 cm 2 . The EQE was measured using QE-R systems (Enli Tech.). PSC simulation PSC simulation was carried out using wxAMPS software, based on the standard p–i–n PSC, FTO/TiO 2
(20 nm)/undoped perovskite (540 nm)/spiro-OMeTAD (200 nm)/Au, and the homojunction PSC, FTO/TiO 2
(20 nm)/n-type perovskite (480 nm)/p-type perovskite (60 nm)/spiro-OMeTAD (200 nm)/Au. The doping concentrations, mobility and other properties of the materials are reported in Supplementary Tables  3
and
4 . AFM and KPFM The surface AFM and KPFM were carried out using an Agilent SPM 5500 with the sample chamber filled with high-purity N 2 . The cross-sectional AFM and KPFM were carried out using an Asylum Research MFP3d with the sample chamber filled with high-purity N 2 . For the cross-sectional KPFM measurements, the devices were cleaved to expose the cross-section from the film side, and no further treatment. We cut a notch at the side of the substrate (outside the active area of the solar cells) using a diamond cutter, and fractured the device by tension rather than by compression to expose the cross-section. The sample was fixed in a custom-made vertical sample holder with electrical connections to both electrodes. The FTO layer of the device was grounded. The measurement was carried out in the dark. The potential images were recorded in tapping mode using a conductive PtSi-FM probe (NANOSENSORS, Pt-coated Si with a frequency of ~75 KHz and a nominal tip radius of ~25 nm). Amplitude-modulation KPFM measurements were carried out. The contact potential difference (CPD) between the probe and the sample was measured simultaneously with the topographic signal by the single-pass mode. The CPD signals reflect the potential distribution of the sample surface, as the workfunction of the probe is constant during the measurement. The topographic height was obtained by maintaining the amplitude of the first cantilever resonance (~71 kHz). To separate topographic from CPD signals, increase the accuracy and minimize probe convolution effects, the a.c. electrostatic force component was generated at the second resonance (~420 kHz) of the cantilever by applying a small a.c. voltage of 0.5 V. The scan rate was 0.6 Hz. KPFM measurements were performed under different bias voltages ( V b ) from +0.5 to −1.0 V on the same area of the cross-section of the device. The
V b
was applied to the device using a Keithley 2400 source meter. The ion migration had no significant effect on the potential distributions during the KPFM scanning with the
V b
from −1 V to +0.5 V within 20 min. We applied the
V b
for 2 min, and then started testing for a stable result. The electric field profiles were obtained by taking the first derivative of the potential profiles. As a small change in noise level potential would tremendously enhance the electric field profiles, the raw data must be smoothed before taking the derivative. TEM The cross-sectional morphologies of the full cells and interface characterization of the homojunction were investigated using a high-resolution TEM. The samples were prepared by vertical etching using FIB equipment (FEI Helios Nanolab 600i). The cross-sectional surface was in situ-coated with platinum using an FEI gas injection system to protect the surface from damage during FIB milling. A cross-sectional specimen approximately 80 nm in thickness was obtained. Then the images were obtained using a high-resolution TEM (FEI Titan G2) at an acceleration voltage of 300 kV.

Abstract Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) require both high efficiency and good long-term stability if they are to be commercialized. It is crucial to finely optimize the energy level matching between the perovskites and hole-transporting materials to achieve better performance. Here, we synthesize a fluorene-terminated hole-transporting material with a fine-tuned energy level and a high glass transition temperature to ensure highly efficient and thermally stable PSCs. We use this material to fabricate photovoltaic devices with 23.2% efficiency (under reverse scanning) with a steady-state efficiency of 22.85% for small-area (~0.094 cm 2 ) cells and 21.7% efficiency (under reverse scanning) for large-area (~1 cm 2 ) cells. We also achieve certified efficiencies of 22.6% (small-area cells, ~0.094 cm 2 ) and 20.9% (large-area, ~1 cm 2 ). The resultant device shows better thermal stability than the device with spiro-OMeTAD, maintaining almost 95% of its initial performance for more than 500 h after thermal annealing at 60 °C.

21 July 2022
Main Over the past few years, hybrid inorganic–organic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted significant amounts of attention due to their photo-physical properties, the potential for low-cost solution fabrication processing, and their high power conversion efficiency (PCE), which presently exceed 22% 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 . Most highly efficient PSCs utilize an n-type layer of mesoporous TiO 2
and a p-type layer of spiro-OMeTAD (or PTAA) in the n-i-p device configuration, where formamidinium (FA)-cation-based perovskite materials are widely used as light absorbers. We previously reported a mixed perovskite of (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15
via composition engineering to stabilize the ‘black’ phase of the FAPbI 3 -based perovskite with a bandgap of ~1.54 eV from the ‘yellow’ phase of a non-photoactive isomer 7 . Recently, Cs or Rb was incorporated into FA/methylammonium (MA) mixtures to improve the photovoltaic performance and stability of PSCs 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 . For the Rb/Cs/FA/MA-containing perovskite, a high open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 1.24 V at a bandgap ( E g ) of 1.63 eV was obtained to yield a PCE of 21.6%, leading to a loss-in-potential (difference between
V OC
and
E g ) of 0.39 V, comparable to that (~0.4 V) of silicon solar cells 15 . Nevertheless, better performance in PSCs requires greater light harvesting to enhance the photocurrent. Very recently, we prepared a mixed perovskite of (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05
with a bandgap of 1.51 eV and successfully reduced the trap concentration of bulk perovskite film by the addition of triiodide ions (I 3 − ) 9 . This approach to eliminate the deep-level traps responsible for non-radiative recombinations within the bulk perovskite film is crucial for reducing the open-circuit voltage loss. The resultant device exhibited a PCE of 22.1% with a high
V OC
of 1.11 V and a high current density ( J SC ) of 25 mA cm −2 . This current can be nearly identical to the maximum value converted from a light absorber with a bandgap of 1.51 eV into current. In addition, a wide range of attempts to achieve a defect-free perovskite film have been made to date. These include passivating the surface, increasing the grain size, reducing the grain boundaries and adjusting the crystal dimensions of the perovskite film 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 . In addition to perovskite layers, interface-material-dependent losses can also be a determining factor that limits the
V OC
of devices rather than nonradiative bulk recombination losses, even if a defect-less perovskite film is suitably prepared to reach the maximal values of
J SC
and fill factor (FF) beyond the theoretical limits. Thus, for further improvements of device performance capabilities, more efforts to maximize the built-in-potential and enhance
V OC
in PSCs are necessary by utilizing selective charge-transporting materials with a suitable energy level and balanced charge transport efficacy. Recent research systematically studied the relationship between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of hole-transporting materials (HTMs) and the photovoltaic parameters, especially
V OC , for spirobifluorene-based derivatives, fluorene–dithiophene derivatives and tetraphenyl–arylamine derivatives, respectively 20 , 21 , 22 . A higher
V OC
is observed with a higher oxidation potential for HTMs when the driving force for hole injection is satisfactory. However, multiple aspects of HTMs, such as the intrinsic charge mobility, dopant-additive optimization for high conductivity, and specific interaction with the surface of the perovskite can cause complicated effects with regard to the ionization potentials (IPs) of HTMs on the
V OC
values of PSCs. For this reason, the top level of performance from a device utilizing a new HTM has rarely been reported, despite the fact that a tremendous number of HTMs have been developed and applied to PSCs in recent years 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 . Thus, only a few new HTMs can be found to exhibit higher
V OC
and higher PCE values than the best device using spiro-OMeTAD. More importantly, enhanced thermal stability of solar cells is also necessary for the commercialization of PSCs. As reported in the literature, most devices employing spiro-OMeTAD as a HTM are associated with severe degradation against thermal stress because the additives resulted in a significant drop in
T g
of the HTM 31 , 32 . This highlights the need for the development of thermally stable alternative HTMs capable of high-performance outcomes in the presence of additives. In this work, we synthesize a fluorene-terminated HTM ( N 2 , N 2′ , N 7 , N 7′ -tetrakis(9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)- N 2 , N 2′ , N 7 , N 7′ -tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)-9,9′-spirobi[fluorene]-2,2′,7,7′-tetraamine) (which we abbreviate to DM) as a model system with a fine-tuned HOMO level in an effort to enhance the
V OC
value and realize a high glass transition temperature
T g
(~160 °C) for thermally stable PCSs. We also prepare a high-quality film sample consisting of a mixed perovskite based on (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05
which has a grain size of 300~1,000 nm. The DM-based device exhibits a large degree of variation in the PCE according to the amount of additive used. The optimized condition led to a higher PCE owing to the higher
V OC
relative to that of a device made with spiro-OMeTAD. The champion device with DM as a HTM shows a PCE of 23.2% with a
J SC
of 24.9 mA cm −2 , FF equal to 81% and a
V OC
of 1.14 V (under reverse scanning). We achieve a certified PCE of 22.6% from the resultant device. We also show a large device with an aperture area of ~1 cm 2
which reached a PCE of 21.7% (under reverse scanning) and a certified PCE of 20.9%. Furthermore, the device with DM shows good long-term stability for 500 h after annealing at 60 °C, whereas the device with spiro-OMeTAD degraded rapidly after only 50 h. Material characteristics Figure

depicts the chemical structures of spiro-OMeTAD and DM. The synthetic details are given in Supplementary Figs.
1–5 . Though most of the recent development of high-performance HTMs has been mainly focused on the development of new central core structures 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , what determines the physical and optoelectronic properties of the HTMs is the conjugated structure of such core and peripheral units 33 , 34 . The peripheral structure is therefore of equal importance to finely tune the properties of the HTMs. With respect to the molecular design of the HTM, we maintained the well-established spirobifluorene core and introduced a fluorene unit as a new peripheral group instead of
p -anisole for spiro-OMeTAD. DM was simply synthesized via two consecutive Buchwald–Hartwig amination reactions using commercially available 2,2′,7,7′-tetrabromo-9,9′-spirobifluorene,
p -anisidine and 2-bromo-9,9-dimethylfluorene. Fig. 1: Optical, electrochemical and thermal characteristic of HTMs. a , b , Chemical structures of spiro-OMeTAD ( a ) and DM ( b ).

e , DSC curves of spiro-OMeTAD and DM. The vertical dashed lines indicate the glass transition temperature. Full size image Figure
1c
shows the absorption spectra of the HTMs; a slight shift to a longer wavelength with regard to the absorption onset for the DM sample probably stemmed from an extended π-conjugation through the fluorene unit compared to the simple
p -anisole of spiro-OMeTAD. This is supported by the molecular simulation results (see Supplementary Fig.
6 ), which show that the electron density of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of DM is more widely distributed in the fluorene part. An additional electrochemical analysis by cyclic voltammetry (CV) was also conducted, as shown in Fig.
1d . Interestingly, the change of the peripheral unit of the HTM from
p -anisole to dimethylfluorene resulted in a slightly increased oxidation potential. Regarding the HOMO level of spiro-OMeTAD as −5.22 eV, the HOMO level of DM was calculated to be −5.27 eV (ref.  33 ). The LUMO levels of the HTMs were also estimated by combining the HOMO level and the optical bandgap values. Thus, the LUMO levels for DM and spiro-OMeTAD corresponded to −2.36 and −2.24 eV, respectively. Next, Fig.
1e
shows the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms of the DM and spiro-OMeTAD; the
T g
clearly increases for DM, reaching 161 °C, which is nearly 40 °C higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD. The increased
T g
of the HTM is beneficial with regard to the stability of the resultant devices. In addition to the DSC results, the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results also clearly show that the introduction of the fluorene unit into DM improved the thermal stability of the HTM itself (see Supplementary Fig.
7 ). The physical characteristics of DM and spiro-OMeTAD are summarized in Table
1 . Table 1 Optical, electrochemical and thermal properties of spiro-OMeTAD and DM Full size table Photovoltaic performance To evaluate DM as a HTM for PSCs, we fabricated a FAPbI 3 -based PSC based on the typical bilayered device configuration consisting of a fluorine-doped tin-oxide (FTO) substrate/blocking layer bl-TiO 2 /mp-TiO 2 /(FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 /HTM/Au. Following our solvent-engineering process, we prepared a dense and flat perovskite-absorbing layer on the mp-TiO 2
scaffold and subsequently deposited DM on top of the perovskite film via spin-coating. Figure
2a
shows a cross-sectional SEM image of the perovskite film. Grain sizes ranging from 300 to 1,000 nm were observed, together with a dense film morphology and full surface coverage in the absence of voids (see Supplementary Fig.
8 ). The film thickness of the perovskite is in the range 500–600 nm. Thus, the average grain sizes are comparable to the film thickness, which is favourable for charge extraction. That is, the photoinduced charges can move in the out-of-plane direction across the HTM towards the electrode without crossing the grain boundaries. The fabricated film using MACl exhibited two typical perovskite XRD peaks at 14˚ and 28˚, indicating the successful formation of the perovskite based on the composition of (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05
(see Supplementary Fig.
8 ). In contrast, no use of MACl resulted in a poor performance of the device, as reported in our previous literature 7 .

e , Relationship between the power conversion efficiency and the amount of additive added to the DM. The added amount of additives indicates the sum amount of Li-TFSI solution in acetonitrile (340 mg ml −1 ) and pure
t BP with 1:1 volume ratio. Full size image The best-performing cell with a small area of 0.0939 cm 2
exhibited a high PCE of 23.2% ( J SC  = 24.91 mA cm − 2 ,
V OC  = 1.144 V, FF = 81.29%) with slight hysteresis behaviour, as displayed in Fig.
2b . The steady-state PCE corresponded to 22.85% (see Supplementary Fig.
9 ). This device produced a certified PCE of 22.6% owing to the enhanced
V OC
(see Supplementary Fig.
10 ). We also prepared a large-area cell (0.991 cm 2 ), demonstrating a PCE of 21.7% ( J SC  = 24.93 mA cm − 2 ,
V OC  = 1.136 V, FF = 76.68%) and a certified PCE of 20.9 %, as shown in Fig.
2c
and Supplementary Fig.
11 . The statistical distribution of the PCE for small-area devices is shown in Fig.
2d . To the best of our knowledge, the certified PCEs of 20.9% for large cells (1 × 1 cm 2 ) represent the highest efficiency among PSCs reported thus far. Such high efficiencies of PCE are achieved by the careful optimization of the HTL composition. We investigated the effect of different amounts of additives (Li-TFSI and
t BP) on the device performance outcomes with the DM-containing HTL and summarized the corresponding photovoltaic results, as shown in Fig.
2e
and Table
2 . Without additives, or with only small amounts of additives, the PCE of the device is very low because the conductivity of DM is not high enough to transport the injected holes through ~150-nm-thick HTL to the Au electrode, causing severe charge recombination and a very low FF, together with reductions in
J SC
and
V OC . By increasing the amount of the additive to 10 μl, the PCE increases as the FF increases, but past an addition of additives of 14 μl, the efficiency drops abruptly due to the large decreases in FF and
V OC . Such a decrease in the PCE is associated with the morphology of the HTM; with a high amount of additives, many more voids in the film are clearly observed (see Supplementary Fig.
12 ). This is probably the main cause of the migration of the metal into the HTM or the diffusion of the additives into the perovskite layer. By carefully adjusting the amount of additives inside the HTL, we could find the optimization condition that maximized hole extraction in the device. The optimized device exhibited a PCE of 22.3% with a
J SC
value of 24.8 mA cm − 2 , a
V OC
value of 1.11 V and a FF equal to 81%, as shown in Fig.
3a . The statistical distribution of the PCE as displayed in Fig.
2d
revealed high repeatability of the device performance. It also showed that the PCE of the best cell exceeded 23%, as mentioned above.

d , Charge recombination lifetimes of devices with spiro-OMeTAD and DM as measured by the transient photovoltaic method as a function of the bias light intensity. Full size image The device using DM as a HTM showed better performance due to a higher
V OC
as compared to the device using spiro-OMeTAD, as shown in Fig.
3a . With respect to
J SC
and FF, the two devices showed nearly identical values. This outcome is related to the similar order of the mobility for DM and spiro-OMeTAD according to space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements (see Supplementary Fig.
13 ). Time-resolved photoluminescence measurement was carried out to elucidate the dynamics of charge transfer occurring at the perovskite/HTM interfaces. As shown in Supplementary Fig.
14
and Supplementary Table
1 , the pristine perovskite film showed a relatively long PL lifetime of 407.5 ns. In case of HTM-coated perovskite films, PL lifetimes decreased greatly, with values of 31.2 and 16.7 ns for the spiro-OMeTAD and DM-coated film, respectively. In general, a shorter lifetime is attributed to a better charge extraction by a hole-accepting layer contacting the perovskite film. Thus, we consider that DM has a comparable charge-extracting ability to spiro-OMeTAD. In addition, we found that the shunt and the series resistance values are similar in the two devices. It is important to note that we used perovskite films fabricated via an identical process and that both HTMs had comparable charge transport properties with respect to the mobility. The condition under which the additives were added was optimized for each HTM in the PSCs. With respect to the band alignment, the HOMO energy levels of each HTM are given in Fig.
3b , implying that DM has a slightly lower HOMO energy level by 0.05 eV than that of spiro-OMeTAD. From photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, a similar trend was also found in Supplementary Fig.
15 . This may be related to the histogram of the
V OC
distribution shown in Fig.
3c , which clearly indicated that a higher built-in voltage was established when spiro-OMeTAD was replaced with DM. To gain more insight into the recombination behaviour of a full device, we carried out transient photovoltage decay measurements under the open-circuit voltage, as shown in Fig.
3d . As a function of the light intensity, the recombination lifetimes ( τ ) for each device with spiro-OMeTAD and DM are nearly identical. No evidence of any change in the defect states related to the bulk or the interfacial recombinations is likely to be found when the light-absorbing perovskite film comes into contact with the HTM in each case. That is, photogenerated holes can be injected into the HTM without significant interfacial recombinations and travel towards Au with no considerable trapping across the HTM layer that would cause reductions in the
J SC
and FF values. For this reason, both devices exhibited excellent behaviour with regard to
J SC
and FF, as high as ~24.8 mA cm – 2
and ~0.80, respectively. In contrast, the distinguished difference among the photovoltaic parameters was only
V OC , which is the main factor determining the PCE of the device, as shown in Fig.
3c
and Supplementary Fig.
16 . As noted above, this is associated with the replacement of the methoxyphenyl moiety by its dimethylfluorene counterpart, which would weaken the electron-donating power considering the molecular design. Compared to spiro-OMeTAD, the HOMO energy level of DM is closer to the valence band of the perovskite, which can favourably increase the built-in voltage at the junction of the device. In consequence, it is reasonable for DM to have a fine-tuned oxidation potential, leading to better energy-level matching with the perovskite and a higher
V OC
value in the device. As a part of our efforts to realize cost-effective HTM, we also introduced spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] as a recently reported low-cost core into DM, instead of spirobifluorene (see Supplementary Figs.
17–19 ) 24 . The synthesized spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene]-based HTM with a peripheral dimethylfluorene moiety also exhibited a satisfying efficiency of 21.5% (see Supplementary Fig.
20 ). Thermal and operational stability To examine the thermal stability of the device prepared with DM, we investigated the thermal behaviour of a pristine HTM and an additive-doped HTM in a powder state using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in a simulation, as shown in Fig.
1e
and Fig.
4a . The observed
T g
of ~161 °C for the pristine DM powder is considerably reduced to ~90 °C after doping with the additives. This is most likely due to the role of liquid-type
t BP as a plasticizer. A similar trend for spiro-OMeTAD can be found in the literature; doping with an additive into a pristine powder led to a significant drop in
T g
from ~120 to ~50 °C (ref.  32 ). Moreover, it was reported that the
T g
values of organic semiconductors can be reduced in the thin-film state as compared to the bulk state 35 . It is known that deformation of spiro-OMeTAD film arises from crystallization after thermal annealing at a high temperature. For this reason, the device made with additive-doped spiro-OMeTAD exhibited apparent degradation when thermal annealing was applied from 60 °C to 80 °C in air (~25% relative humidity, RH) (Fig.
4b ). In contrast, though slight degradation of the device was observed after thermal stress at 80 °C, the device with DM exhibited much better stability under an identical condition than the device with spiro-OMeTAD. Even after thermal stress at 60 °C for 500 h, the device performance was maintained at ~95% of the original value (see Fig.
4c ). This is good evidence that our strategy of using a HTM with a high
T g
value is feasible in PSCs, even if a higher
T g
value of the HTM is still required for better thermal stability of the device. Furthermore, the encapsulated device using DM is also highly stable, with PCE maintaining 92.6% of its initial value after 310 h under continuous illumination condition (see Fig.
4d
and Supplementary Fig.
21 ). Fig. 4: Thermal and photostability of perovskite cells using DM. a , DSC curves of the DM powder with and without dopants.

J SC
of 24.3 mA cm – 2 , a
V OC
of 1.11 V and a FF of 76.8%, which were measured from
J − V
curves. Full size image In conclusion, we have demonstrated highly efficient and thermally stable PSCs by employing a fluorene-terminated DM that has a HOMO energy level well matched to perovskite along with a high glass transition temperature ( T g ). We fabricated a DM-based device and achieved high PCE values of 23.2% and 21.7% for small- (~0.094 cm 2 ) and large-area (~1 cm 2 ) cells, respectively, due to the significant reduction of the voltage loss of the device. The outcomes here were certified at 22.6% and 20.9% for small- and large-area cells, respectively. Furthermore, the device with DM showed better thermal stability than the device with spiro-OMeTAD, maintaining almost ~95% of its initial performance for more than 500 h after thermal annealing at 60 °C. We firmly believe that our fluorene-terminated DM created via molecular engineering is a promising HTM candidate for the fabrication of highly efficient and thermally stable PSCs and that our strategy in this work will offer a new direction for the fabrication of highly efficient and stable PSCs.

Device fabrication A dense blocking layer of TiO 2
(bl-TiO 2 ) was deposited onto a FTO (Pilkington, TEC8) substrate by spray pyrolysis deposition carried out using a 20 mM titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution (Sigma-Aldrich) at 450 °C. Subsequently, mesoporous TiO 2
(mp-TiO 2 ) films were spin-coated onto the bl-TiO 2 /FTO substrate using diluted commercial paste (SC-HT040, ShareChem) and were calcined at 500 °C for 1 h in air to remove the organic portion. To fabricate perovskite solar cells based on (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 , the perovskite solution was prepared by dissolving 889 mg ml −1
of FAPbI 3 , 33 mg ml −1
of MAPbBr 3
and 33 mg ml −1
of MACl in DMF/DMSO (8:1 v/v) mixed solvent. Then, the solution was coated onto the mp-TiO 2 / bl -TiO 2 /FTO substrate by two consecutive spin-coating steps, at 1,000 and 5,000 r.p.m. for 5 s and 20 s, respectively. During the second spin-coating (5,000 r.p.m.) step, 1 ml of ethyl ether was poured onto the substrate after 15 s. The intermediate phase substrate was then put on a hot plate at 150 °C for 10 min. For deposition of hole-transport materials, a spiro-OMeTAD solution in chlorobenzene (CB) (90.9 mg ml −1 ) was prepared, and 23 μl of lithium-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI) solution in acetonitrile (ACN) (540 mg ml −1 ) and 39 μl of pure 4- tert -butylpyridine ( t BP) were added in 1.1 ml of the solution. The spiro-OMeTAD solution including additives was spin-coated onto the perovskite surface at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. In the case of DM, a DM solution in CB (28.6 mg ml −1 ) was prepared, and 0–9 μl of Li-TFSI solution in ACN (340 mg ml −1 ) and 0–9 μl of pure
t BP (no dilution) were added in 0.35 ml of the solution. The added volume ratio of Li-TFSI solution and pure
t BP is 1:1. The DM solution including additives was spin-coated onto the perovskite surface at 2,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. Finally, a Au counter electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation. Characterizations and measurements The
J–V
curves were measured using a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Class A, 91195 A) with a source meter (Keithley 2420) at a size of 100 mA cm − 2
under illumination at AM 1.5 G and a calibrated Si-reference cell certified by NREL. The
J − V
curves were measured along the reverse scan direction from 1.5 V to −0.2 V or the forward scan direction from −0.2 V to 1.5 V. The step voltage and scan speed were fixed at 10 mV and 150 mV s −1 , respectively. The
J–V
curves for all devices were measured by metal masks with active areas of 0.0939 cm 2
(small-area device) and 0.991 cm 2
(large-area device) in size. Electrochemical properties of the HTMs were investigated by three-electrode cyclic voltammetry (CV) using a BAS 100B electrochemical analyser. DM or spiro-OMeTAD was dissolved in 0.1 M methylene chloride solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate. Two platinum electrodes were used as working electrode and counter electrode, respectively, and Ag/Ag +
was used as reference electrode. The scanning rate was 50 mV s −1 , and the measured potentials were calibrated using ferrocene as an internal standard. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay profiles were measured at 800 nm with the 532 nm excitation of an OPO laser system (NT 342A-10-AW, EKSPLA). The pulse energy was strongly attenuated to less than 1 μJ, to avoid nonlinear effects such as exciton–exciton annihilation. Emissions from samples were collected by a monochromator (SP2150, Princeton Instruments) equipped with a photomultiplier tube (PMT) (Hamamatsu, H10721-20). The output signal from a PMT was recorded with a 500 MHz digital oscilloscope (DSO-X 3054 A, Agilent). For estimating the valence band maxima of the perovskites and the ionization potentials of the HTMs, photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) measurements were performed using a Riken Keiki AC-2 photoelectron spectrometer in air. SEM images were obtained using a Tescan Mira 3 LMU FEG field-emission scanning electron microscope. The XRD was measured by the Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer using Cu Ka radiation. Transient photovoltage decay measurements were taken using a nanosecond laser (EKSPLA, NT342A-10) as a small perturbation light source and a Xe lamp (Zolix, 150 W) as a bias light source. The device was directly connected to a digital oscilloscope (Agilent, DSO-X 3054 A) with the input impedance of the oscilloscope set to 1 MΩ for an open-circuit condition. The bias light intensity was controlled by a neutral density filter set for various open-circuit voltages ( V oc ) and a strongly attenuated laser pulse of 550 nm was used to generate a voltage transient (Δ V ) of less than 20 mV. Device stability test Thermal stability tests were performed by aging an encapsulated device with increasing temperature (at 60 °C, 70 °C and 80 °C for 50 h, respectively) on a hot plate in ambient air (~25% RH). PCE of the device was periodically measured under AM1.5 G simulated sun light after cooling the device down to room temperature. Long-term thermal stability tests were carried out at 60 °C for 500 h on a hot plate in ambient air, and PCE was periodically recorded under AM1.5 G simulated sun light at room temperature. All of devices for thermal stability test were stored in dark conditions. Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) was also carried out to verify the long-term photostability. The maximum power point of the encapsulated device under AM1.5 G simulated LED light (LSH-7320, Newport, USA) was measured by using a source meter (Keithley 2420, USA) operated by self-written software using a perturb-observe algorithm. The environmental conditions were maintained at a temperature of 25 °C and a relative humidity of 25% RH. The temperature of the devices was maintained between 30 and 40 °C by air cooling. The devices were encapsulated using a getter-dispersed polymer barrier under a nitrogen atmosphere. Finally, those were covered with thermally curable epoxy resin and cover glass.

Abstract Perovskite solar cells typically comprise electron- and hole-transport materials deposited on each side of a perovskite active layer. So far, only two organic hole-transport materials have led to state-of-the-art performance in these solar cells 1 : poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) 2 , 3 , 4 , 5
and 2,2ʹ,7,7ʹ-tetrakis( N , N -di- p -methoxyphenylamine)-9,9ʹ-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) 6 , 7 . However, these materials have several drawbacks in terms of commercialization, including high cost 8 , the need for hygroscopic dopants that trigger degradation of the perovskite layer 9
and limitations in their deposition processes 10 . Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is an alternative hole-transport material with excellent optoelectronic properties 11 , 12 , 13 , low cost 8 , 14
and ease of fabrication 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , but so far the efficiencies of perovskite solar cells using P3HT have reached only around 16 per cent 19 . Here we propose a device architecture for highly efficient perovskite solar cells that use P3HT as a hole-transport material without any dopants. A thin layer of wide-bandgap halide perovskite is formed on top of the narrow-bandgap light-absorbing layer by an in situ reaction of
n -hexyl trimethyl ammonium bromide on the perovskite surface. Our device has a certified power conversion efficiency of 22.7 per cent with hysteresis of ±0.51 per cent; exhibits good stability at 85 per cent relative humidity without encapsulation; and upon encapsulation demonstrates long-term operational stability for 1,370 hours under 1-Sun illumination at room temperature, maintaining 95 per cent of the initial efficiency. We extend our platform to large-area modules (24.97 square centimetres)—which are fabricated using a scalable bar-coating method for the deposition of P3HT—and achieve a power conversion efficiency of 16.0 per cent. Realizing the potential of P3HT as a hole-transport material by using a wide-bandgap halide could be a valuable direction for perovskite solar-cell research.

Main Despite the potential advantages of P3HT as an organic hole-transport material (HTM) in perovskite solar cells (Extended Data Table  1 ), the resulting devices have a low open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) due to additional non-radiative recombination at the perovskite/P3HT interface 20 . It has also been suggested that strong electronic coupling between the flat P3HT molecules and the perovskite results in a relatively lower electron lifetime (as compared with spiro-OMeTAD 21 ), and physically poor contact hampers efficient hole transfer from the perovskite to P3HT 22 . To overcome these issues, here we introduce a double-layered halide architecture (DHA) in which an ultrathin wide-bandgap halide (WBH) is stacked onto a narrow-bandgap-halide (NBH) light-absorbing layer, prior to deposition of the HTM (Fig.  1a ). The aim of inserting the WBH layer is to effectively reduce recombination at the perovskite/P3HT interface. This DHA concept is analogous to that of a heterojunction with an intrinsic thin-layer structure, which is a successful strategy for high-performance silicon-based solar cells 23 . The WBH layer is formed simply by the in situ reaction of
n -hexyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (HTAB) on the perovskite surface. The HTAB molecule comprises a functionalized moiety (N + (CH 3 ) 3 -) and an aliphatic moiety (C 6 H 13 -), the latter of which could enable favourable van der Waals interactions between the organic HTM and the perovskite. In particular, when P3HT is deposited onto the surface of the DHA, interdigitation of its alkyl chains and the analogous alkyl chains of HTAB (C 6 H 13 -) should promote the self-assembly of P3HT. Moreover, it has previously been reported that the N + (CH 3 ) 3 - moiety renders a perovskite surface more resistant to degradation under humid conditions 24 .

shows 2D grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) patterns of the control perovskite (NBH) and DHA (WBH/NBH). Compared to the control, a distinct signal at a
q z
of 0.39 Å −1
along the perpendicular direction to the substrate was detected for the DHA. Another intense signal was observed at a
q xy
of 0.67 Å −1
along the direction parallel to the substrate, which could be associated with lateral ordering in the WBH layer of the DHA (Extended Data Fig.  1 ). The distinct crystalline phase forms only at a composition of HTAB 0.3 (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05
(where FAPbI 3
is formamidinium lead iodide and MAPbBr 3
is methylammonium lead bromide; Extended Data Fig.  2a ). Figure  1d, e
shows scanning electron microscopy images of the surface of the control and the DHA samples. In the DHA sample, the surface of the perovskite is fully covered with the WBH layer, which is thin enough to discern the grain boundaries underneath it. The concentration of the HTAB solution is a critical factor in the fabrication of the WBH layer (Extended Data Fig.  3 ). In order to distinguish the two different halide layers, a cross-section of the DHA was observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) (Fig.  1f, g ). As compared to a cross-sectional HRTEM image of the control, a thin WBH layer with a thickness of around 12 nm could be clearly discerned. The results obtained from high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning TEM and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy show that the WBH layer contains a lower content of lead atoms as compared with the underlying NBH layer; this is a result of the lower proportion of lead in the WBH due to the incorporation of HTAB molecules (Extended Data Fig.  4 ). The energy levels of each layer in the DHA device were determined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy (Extended Data Figs.  2 b,
5 ). The enhanced
V OC
of HTM-free DHA-based perovskite solar cells and the longer charge lifetime in the DHA device demonstrate that the WBH layer effectively passivates charge traps on the perovskite surface (Extended Data Fig.  6 ). We next investigated the effect of the aliphatic moiety of HTAB in the WBH on the deposition of P3HT. We observed the morphology of the P3HT layer on top of a pristine perovskite (NBH) and in the DHA (WBH/NBH) using atomic force microscopy (Fig.  2a, b ). In the control sample, the P3HT layer showed a smooth morphology along the perovskite grains. In the DHA sample, a fibril structure of self-assembled P3HT was observed. The charge-transporting properties of the P3HT polymer are known to be highly dependent on the morphology 12 , 13 ; amorphous P3HT has a low charge mobility 13

f , Full-width at half-maximum of azimuthal cuts obtained from the corresponding data in

and
e . Full size image The different morphologies of the P3HT layer on the control and the DHA surface were also confirmed by other analytical methods. Raman spectra of both the control and the DHA samples covered with P3HT show a symmetric C=C stretch (around 1,446 cm −1 ) and a C−C intraring stretch (around 1,380 cm −1 ) corresponding to the main in-plane ring-skeleton modes of the thiophene units 25
(Fig.  2c ). The Raman intensities of P3HT on the DHA surface are much higher than those of P3HT on the control perovskite surface. This suggests that more of the P3HT polymers on the DHA surface are oriented along the preferred direction. Raman spectra were then obtained for P3HT on DHA surfaces that had been treated with alkyl trimethyl ammonium bromides of different chain lengths. It was found that treatment with HTAB produces DHAs with the optimal surface for interaction with P3HT, with these devices showing the highest photovoltaic performance among those treated with other alkyl ammonium bromides (Extended Data Fig.  7 ). This is also evidenced by the azimuthal cuts along the (100) peak of P3HT on the control and DHA obtained from GIWAXS measurements with various incidence angles (Fig.  2d, e ). The full-width at half-maximum of the corresponding azimuthal cuts indicates that the extent of edge-on orientation of the P3HT polymers on DHA is higher in all regions—regardless of the location on the P3HT film—than that of P3HT polymers on the control (Fig.  2f ). We consider that the alkyl chain of HTAB in the WBH interacts with the P3HT polymer, resulting in a highly oriented, self-assembled P3HT layer. We attained a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.3% for the best-performing DHA-based perovskite solar cell, along with a stabilized PCE of 23.0% in a maximum power point tracking system (Fig.  3a ). It is especially notable that a PCE of greater than 23.0% is achieved by P3HT without any dopants as a HTM. Figure  3b
compares the photovoltaic performance of control and DHA devices using P3HT as the HTM. The DHA device achieved a certified photovoltaic performance of 22.7% with negligible hysteresis of ±0.51% at a credible photovoltaic laboratory (Extended Data Fig.  8 ). The DHA configuration thus shows a marked improvement in PCE, which is associated with an enhanced
V OC
and fill factor as well as an absence of hysteresis. Figure  3c
shows Mott–Schottky plots of control and DHA devices without electron-transport layers. These plots directly demonstrate the higher flat-band potential of the DHA device compared with the control device, which is related to an increase in
V OC . To further investigate this, we fabricated DHA devices using other dopant-free HTMs. Although these devices also showed an enhanced
V OC , the largest improvement was obtained using P3HT as the HTM (Extended Data Fig.  9 , Extended Data Table  2 ). This suggests that, among the tested HTMs, P3HT shows the greatest synergistic effect on photovoltaic performance in the DHA devices, because the WBH layer not only leads to a higher flat-band potential but also to the self-assembly of P3HT. Moreover, we found that the DHA device with P3HT has a lower series resistance ( R s ) than the control device with P3HT, whereas the DHA film has a higher
R s
than the control perovskite film due to the high aliphatic content of the WBH (Extended Data Fig.  10 ). The lower
R s
in the DHA device supports interfacial charge transfer and transport through the WBH and P3HT layers under operation conditions, and accounts for the enhanced fill factor. A statistical analysis of the photovoltaic parameters of 27 corresponding devices reveals that the performance of the DHA device is reproducible (Fig.  3d ). Therefore, our strategy of constructing a DHA device with P3HT is considered to be effective in improving the interfacial contact between the perovskite and the P3HT, thereby achieving a considerable enhancement of the PCE.

Error bars indicate the minimum and maximum values, and the middle line in each box represents the median value. Full size image To explore the effect of the configuration of the DHA on its resistance to moisture, we monitored the long-term stability of control and DHA devices without any encapsulation under 85% relative humidity at room temperature (Fig.  4a ). The DHA device maintained nearly 80% of its initial efficiency after 1,008 h, whereas the control device was completely degraded within 200 h. Furthermore, we tested the operational stability of devices that were encapsulated with a face-sealing adhesive sheet, under continuous 1-Sun illumination at room temperature by tracking their maximum power point (Fig.  4b ). The DHA device showed substantial long-term stability, maintaining more than 95% of its initial PCE for 1,370 h, whereas the control device showed severe degradation within 100 h. Better interfacial contact between the perovskite and the HTM is therefore crucial for facilitating hole transfer at the interface, reducing the hysteresis of the device, and achieving long-term device stability against bias and light.

d , Current–voltage ( I − V ) curves of the DHA-based solar modules formed by depositing the P3HT layer using spin-coating (orange) and bar-coating (purple) methods. Full size image As well as the performance of perovskite solar cells, another issue of importance to commercialization is their large-scale production. Recently, some promising progress has been made in the fabrication of highly uniform large-area perovskite films via scalable coating methods 26 . However, with the exception of spin-coating approaches, there have been few reports of the deposition of HTM on large-area modules 10 , 16 . We fabricated DHA-based modules at a size of 5 cm × 5 cm (Fig.  4c , Extended Data Fig.  11 ) and used two different deposition methods—spin-coating and bar-coating—for deposition of the P3HT layer. The performance of both modules was similar, with high PCEs of 16.3% and 16.0% (average values obtained under reverse- and forward-bias scan directions) for devices fabricated using spin-coating and bar-coating, respectively (Fig.  4d ). This demonstrates that scalable methods for P3HT deposition can be applied to a DHA configuration without a reduction in performance. Our work establishes the potential of P3HT as a HTM using a double-layered halide architecture, and could contribute towards the realization of commercial perovskite solar cells. Methods Materials Titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate), hydriodic acid, bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonamide lithium salt and methyl ammonium chloride were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Formamidine acetate was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Lead iodide, lead bromide, methyl ammonium bromide, and

All of the purchased chemicals were used as received without further purification. DHA device fabrication A dense TiO 2
layer was deposited on a fluorine-doped SnO 2
(FTO, Pilkington, TEC8) substrate by spray pyrolysis using a 10 vol% titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution in ethanol at 450 °C. A mesoporous TiO 2
was coated on the dense TiO 2 /FTO substrate using mesoporous TiO 2
dispersed solution diluted in mixed solvent (2-methoxylethanol:terpineol = 3.5:1 w/w) and heat-treated at 500 °C for 1 h for calcination. Bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide lithium salt was treated on the substrate. Then, for fabrication of the perovskite film, the perovskite solution was prepared by dissolving 889 mg ml −1
of formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI 3 ), 33 mg ml −1
of methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr 3 ) and 33 mg ml −1
of methylammonium chloride (MACl) in
N , N -dimethyl formamide/dimethyl sulfoxide (8:1 v/v) mixed solvent. The solution was deposited by two consecutive spin-coating steps of 1,000 r.p.m. and 5,000 r.p.m. for 5 s and 20 s, respectively. During the second spin-coating step (5,000 r.p.m.), 1 ml of diethyl ether was quickly poured onto the substrate after 15 s. The intermediate phase film was put on a hotplate at 150 °C for 10 min. After the fabrication of perovskite film, for the development of the double-layered halide architecture, 1.0 mM
n -hexyl trimethylammonium bromide solution in mixed solvent ( o -dichlorobenzene:isopropanol = 97:3 v/v) was spin-coated on the perovskite film at 5,000 r.p.m. for 10 s. Then, the substrate was heat-treated at 150 °C for 30 s. The hole-transport layer was deposited by spin-coating P3HT solution (10 mg ml −1 ) in mixed solvent (chlorobenzene:diphenyl ether = 97:3 v/v) at 3,000 r.p.m. For the deposition of other organic hole-transport layers, PTAA solution (7.5 mg ml −1 ) in toluene, spiro-OMeTAD solution (20 mg ml −1 ) in chlorobenzene, and PCPDTBT and PTB7 solution (10 mg ml −1 ) in chlorobenzene were stacked. Finally, a gold electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation. Fabrication of 5 cm × 5 cm DHA modules The module composed of eight-strip cells connected in series was scribed using CO 2
laser RF type (EL-MKRF Series, South Korea). For fabrication of solar modules, 7 cm × 7 cm FTO substrates were patterned by a laser with a power of 85 W and a scribing width of 150 μm. Next, dense TiO 2 /mesoporous TiO 2 /DHA/P3HT layers were scribed by a laser with a power of 50 W and a scribing width of 150 μm. Finally, gold layers were scribed by a laser with a power of 30 W and a scribing width of 100 μm. We designed the modules to have a geometric fill factor of 94.4%. A dense TiO 2
layer was deposited on the pattered FTO substrate by same method with unit-cell case. A mesoporous TiO 2
was spin-coated with 1 ml of the mesoporous TiO 2
dispersed solution at 2,500 r.p.m. and heat-treated. On the mesoporous TiO 2
layer, bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide lithium salt was treated by same method with unit-cell case. Then, for fabrication of the perovskite film, 0.3 ml of the perovskite solution was loaded on a mesoporous TiO 2 /dense TiO 2 /FTO substrate and deposited by two consecutive spin-coating steps of 1,000 r.p.m. and 3,000 r.p.m. for 5 s and 20 s, respectively. During the second spin-coating step (3,000 r.p.m.), 4 ml of diethyl ether was poured onto the substrate. The intermediate phase film was put on a hotplate at 150 °C for 10 min. For double-layered halide architecture development, 2.7 ml of
n -hexyl trimethylammonium bromide solution was spin-coated at 3,000 r.p.m. and put on a hotplate at 150 °C for 30 s. For P3HT deposition on the perovskite modules by spin-coating, 630 μl of the P3HT solution was spin-coated onto the DHA surface. When using the bar-coating method, 40 μl of P3HT was loaded in the gap (around 140 μm) between the bar and the DHA surface, and the bar was advanced towards the opposite side at a speed of 15 mm s −1 . Finally, a gold electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation. Characterization GIWAXS measurements were conducted at the PLS-II 6D UNISTPAL beamline of Pohang Accelerator Laboratory in South Korea. The X-rays coming from the bending magnet were monochromated ( λ  = 1.069 Å). The incidence angle of the X-ray beam was set to 0.10°, which is close to the critical angle of the surface of samples. For the depth profile analysis of the thin film, various incidence angles were applied (0.08°, 0.10°, 0.12°, 0.14° and 0.19°). Two-dimensional GIWAXS patterns were recorded with a 2D charge-coupled device detector (Rayonix MX 225-HS). Diffraction angles were calibrated by a pre-calibrated sucrose sample (monoclinic, P21,
a  = 10.8631 Å,
b  = 8.7044 Å,
c  = 7.7624 Å,
β  = 102.938°) and the sample-to-detector distance was 248.5 mm. The surface morphologies of the film were observed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (MIRA3 LMU, Tescan) and cross views of samples close to the surface were observed using a field-emission transmission electron microscope and a high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (Tecnal G 2 F30S-Twin, FEI). P3HT surfaces were observed using an atomic force microscope (MultiMode 8 non-contact mode, Bruker). Raman spectra of P3HT were obtained using a high-resolution dispersive Raman microscope (LabRAM HR Evolution, Horiba) equipped with an argon ion continuous-wave laser ( λ  = 514 nm) at room temperature. To estimate photovoltaic performance, perovskite solar cells were measured using a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Class A, 91195A) with a source meter (Keithley 2420) of 100 mA cm −2
under illumination at AM 1.5G and a calibrated Si-reference cell certificated by NREL. The
J − V
curves were obtained by scanning along the reverse scan direction and the forward scan direction in the range of −0.2 V to 1.5 V in the case of unit cells and −0.2 V to 9.0 V in the case of modules. The step voltage was set at 10 mV for unit cells and 54 mV for modules, and the scan speed was fixed at 150 mV s −1 . The designated illumination area of the module is defined as shown in Extended Data Fig.  11
and estimated by averaging values of five separate measurements from the open-source image processing program ‘ImageJ’. The photovoltaic performance measurements were carried out at room temperature under air. For Mott–Schottky analysis, capacitance–voltage measurements were performed at fixed frequency (1 kHz), using FTO/NBH/(WBH)/P3HT/Au devices without an electron-transport layer (Autolab PGSTAT302N, Metrohm AG). The X-ray diffraction spectra were measured using a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer with an X-ray tube (Cu Kα,
λ  = 1.5406 Å). Ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu UV 2550 spectrophotometer. Valence-band maxima and work functions of each layer were obtained from a photoelectron spectroscopy system (Thermo VG Scientific, Sigma Probe) using a HeI (21.22 eV) discharge lamp with 0.47 eV full-width at half-maximum energy resolution under ultra-high vacuum (10 −9
Torr). Time-correlated single-photon counting measurements were performed using a single-mode pulsed diode laser (470 nm with an instrument response function of around 30 ps and an average power of around 0.1 μW) as an excitation source at Korea Basic Science Institute, Daegu centre in South Korea. A single photon avalanche diode (PDM series, MPD) was used to collect emissions from the samples. Device stability testing For conducting stability tests against humidity, bare devices were kept in a thermo-hygrostat (TH-DG-150, JEIO TECH) which was set under 85% relative humidity at 25 °C. Photovoltaic performance of the aged devices was measured under ambient conditions. Maximum power point tracking was carried out to estimate long-term operational stability. Power conversion efficiency of the encapsulated device under AM 1.5G simulated white LED light (LSH-7320, Newport) was measured by using a source meter (Keithley 2420), and a maximum power point tracking system was operated by a program designed in our laboratory with a perturb-observe algorithm. The environmental conditions during operation were maintained at 25 °C with a relative humidity of around 30%. The device was encapsulated by laminating face-sealing adhesive sheets developed for organic electronic devices.

Abstract Even though the mesoporous-type perovskite solar cell (PSC) is known for high efficiency, its planar-type counterpart exhibits lower efficiency and hysteretic response. Herein, we report success in suppressing hysteresis and record efficiency for planar-type devices using EDTA-complexed tin oxide (SnO 2 ) electron-transport layer. The Fermi level of EDTA-complexed SnO 2
is better matched with the conduction band of perovskite, leading to high open-circuit voltage. Its electron mobility is about three times larger than that of the SnO 2 . The record power conversion efficiency of planar-type PSCs with EDTA-complexed SnO 2
increases to 21.60% (certified at 21.52% by Newport) with negligible hysteresis. Meanwhile, the low-temperature processed EDTA-complexed SnO 2
enables 18.28% efficiency for a flexible device. Moreover, the unsealed PSCs with EDTA-complexed SnO 2
degrade only by 8% exposed in an ambient atmosphere after 2880 h, and only by 14% after 120 h under irradiation at 100 mW cm −2 .

Introduction Owing to the singular properties, including tuned band gap, small exciton energy, excellent bipolar carrier transport, long charge diffusion length, and amazingly high tolerance to defects 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , organometal halide perovskites have been projected to be promising candidates for a multitude of optoelectronic applications, including photovoltaics, light emission, photodetectors, X-ray imaging, lasers, gamma-ray detection, subwavelength photonic devices in a long-wavelength region, etc. 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 . The rapid increase efficiency in a solar cell based on organometal halide perovskites validates its promise in photovoltaics. In the last few years, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of mesoporous-type perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has increased to 23.3% by optimizing thin-film growth, interface, and absorber materials 15 , 16 , 17 . As of today, almost all PSCs with high PCE are based on mesoporous-type PSCs that often require high temperature to sinter the mesoporous layer for the best performance, compromising its low-cost advantage and limiting its application in flexible and tandem devices 16 , 17 . In order to overcome this issue, planar-type PSC comprising of stacked planar thin films has been developed 18 , 19
using low-temperature and low-cost synthesis processes 20 , 21 , 22
since the long charge diffusion length and bipolar carrier properties of perovskites 23 , 24 . However, compared to the mesoporous-type PSC, its planar-type counterpart suffers from significant lower certified PCE 18 , 25 . In a typical planar-type PSC, the perovskite absorber usually inserts between the electron-transport layer (ETL) and the hole-transport layer (HTL) to achieve inverted p–i–n or regular n–i–p configuration 21 . Generally, the inverted device structure utilizing fullerene ETL displays very low hysteresis, however, it usually yields lower PCE, not to mention that fullerene is very expensive 26 , 27 . Therefore, research has focused on n–i–p architecture to provide low cost and high efficiency 28 , 29 . Even though ETL-free planar-type PSCs have been reported 30 , 31 , their highest PCE is only 14.14%, significantly lower than that of the cells with ETL, demonstrating the importance of the ETL in this configuration of PSCs. A suitable ETL should meet some basic requirements for high device efficiency 32 . For instance, decent optical transmittance to ensure enough light is transmitted into the perovskite absorber, matched energy level with the perovskite materials to produce the expected open-circuit voltage ( V oc ), and high electron mobility to extract carriers from the active layer effectively in order to avoid charge recombination, etc. Fast carrier extraction is desired to restrict charge accumulation at the interface due to ion migration for reduced hysteresis in the planar-type PSCs. Thus, emphasis has been on developing high-quality ETLs with suitable energy level and high electron mobility for high PCE devices. Thus far, TiO 2
is still the most widely used ETL in high-efficiency n–i–p planar-type PSCs due to its excellent photoelectric properties 33 . However, the electron mobility of TiO 2
ETL is too low (ca. 10 −4  cm 2  V −1  s −1 ) to match with high hole mobility of commonly used HTLs (ca. 10 −3  cm 2  V −1  s −1 ), leading to charge accumulation at the TiO 2 /perovskite interface that causes hysteresis and reduced efficiency 34 . There have been extensive efforts in developing low-temperature TiO 2
ETL, such as exploring low- temperature synthesis processes through doping and chemical engineering. The results shown by Tan et al. demonstrate that use of chlorine to modify the TiO 2
microstructure at low temperatures provides promising PCE of 20.1% 35 . Recently, SnO 2
has been demonstrated as an alternative ETL to replace TiO 2 , owing to its more suitable energy level relative to perovskite and higher electron mobility. Ke et al. first used SnO 2
thin film as an ETL in regular planar-type PSCs and demonstrated a PCE of 16.02% with improved hysteresis 36 . Later, the SnO 2 –TiO 2
(planar and mesoporous) composite layers were developed to enhance the performance of the PSCs 37 , 38 . It is noteworthy to mention that Al 3+ -doped SnO 2
provides even better performance 39 . Subsequently, a variety of methods, such as solution deposition, atomic layer deposition, chemical bath deposition, etc. 40 , 41 , 42
have been developed for synthesizing SnO 2
thin film to improve the performance of planar-type PSCs 43 . Recently, Jiang et al. developed the SnO 2
nanoparticles as the ETL and demonstrated a certified efficiency as high as 19.9% with very low hysteresis 21 . However, the PCE of the planar-type PSCs is still lower than that of the mesoporous-type devices likely due to charge accumulation at the ETL/perovskite interface caused by relatively low electron mobility of the ETL 44 . It is expected that better PSC performance will be achieved by increasing electron mobility of the ETLs. Ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) provides excellent modification of ETLs in organic solar cells owing to its strong chelation function. Li et al. have employed EDTA to passivate ZnO-based ETL and demonstrated improved performance of the organic solar cells 45 . However, when the EDTA–ZnO layer is used in the present perovskite cells, the hydroxyl groups or acetate ligands on the ZnO surface react with the perovskite and proton transfer reactions occur at the perovskite/ZnO interface, leading to poor device performance 46 . In the present work, we realize an EDTA-complexed SnO 2
(E-SnO 2 ) ETLs by complexing EDTA with SnO 2
in planar-type PSCs to attain PCE as high as 21.60%, and certified PCE reaches to 21.52%, the highest reported value to date for the planar-type PSCs. Owing to the low-temperature processing for E-SnO 2 , we fabricate flexible PSCs, and the PCE reaches to 18.28%. Besides, the PSCs based on E-SnO 2
show negligible hysteresis because of the eliminated charge accumulation at the perovskite/ETL interface. We find that the electron mobility of E-SnO 2
increases by about three times compared to that of SnO 2 , leading to negligible current density–voltage ( J–V ) hysteresis due to improved electron extraction from the perovskite absorber 21 . Furthermore, we find that SnO 2
surface becomes more hydrophilic upon EDTA treatment, which decreases the Gibbs free energy for heterogeneous nucleation, resulting in high quality of the perovskite film. Results Fabrication and characterization of E-SnO 2
It is well known that EDTA can react with transition metal oxide to form a complex, because it can provide its lone-pair electrons to the vacant
d -orbital of the transition metal atom 47 . Thus, EDTA was chosen to modify the SnO 2
to improve its performance. Supplementary Fig.  1a
describes the chemical reaction that occurred when the SnO 2
was treated using the EDTA aqueous solution, resulting in the formation of a five-membered ring chelate. The images of EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2
samples are shown in Supplementary Fig.  1b . It is apparent that the unmodified EDTA and SnO 2
samples are transparent, while EDTA-treated SnO 2
turned into milky white. Supplementary Fig.  2
compares the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of the E-SnO 2
solution measured in the freshly prepared condition and again after it was stored in an ambient atmosphere for 2 months. It is clear that there is no obvious difference between the two solutions indicating the high stability. Figure  1a
shows the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) for EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2
films deposited on quartz substrates. In order to reduce the charging effect, the exposed surface of the quartz substrate was coated with a conductive silver paint and connected to the ground. We calibrated the binding energy scale for all XPS measurements to the carbon 1 s
line at 284.8 eV. It is clear from these measurements that SnO 2
shows only peaks attributed to Sn and O. After the EDTA treatment, the E-SnO 2
film shows an additional peak located at ca. 400 eV, ascribed to N. Meanwhile, the Sn 3 d
peaks from E-SnO 2
are shifted by ca. 0.16 eV in contrast to the pristine SnO 2
(Supplementary Fig.  3 ), indicating that EDTA is bound to the SnO 2 . Fig. 1 Characterization of the ETLs.

using the SCLC model, and the inset shows the device structure of ITO/Al/ETL/Al Full size image FTIR was used to study the interaction between SnO 2
and EDTA. As shown in Fig.  1b , the peaks around 2895 cm −1
and 1673 cm −1
belong to C–H and C=O stretching vibration in the EDTA, respectively. The characteristic peaks of SnO 2
observed at ca. 701 cm −1
and 549 cm −1
are due to O–Sn–O stretch and the Sn–O vibration, respectively 48 . In addition, the peak at 1040 cm −1
in the SnO 2
film is attributed to O–O stretching vibration due to oxygen adsorption on the SnO 2
surface 49 . For the E-SnO 2
sample, the characteristic peaks of SnO 2
shift to 713 cm −1
and 563 cm −1 , and the C–H and C=O stretching vibration peaks shift to 2913 cm −1
and 1624 cm −1 , further demonstrating that the EDTA is indeed complexed with SnO 2 . Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2
films deposited on the ITO substrates are shown in Fig.  1c . The data reveal that the E-SnO 2
film shows the smallest root-mean-square roughness of 2.88 nm, a key figure-of-merit for the PSCs 50 . We also measured their Fermi level by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), with the surface potential images shown in Supplementary Fig.  4 , and the calculated details are described in Supplementary Note  1 . Figure  1d
provides energy band alignment between perovskites and different ETLs. The Fermi level of E-SnO 2
is very close to the conduction band of perovskite, which is beneficial for enhancing
V oc 51 . Figure  1e
shows the optical transmission spectra of EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2
films coated on ITO. All these samples display high average transmittance in the visible region, demonstrating good optical quality. In addition, the electron mobility of various ETLs was measured using the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method 20 , as shown in Fig.  1f . It is found that electron mobility of E-SnO 2
is 2.27 × 10 −3  cm 2  V −1  s −1 , significantly larger than those of the EDTA (3.56 × 10 −5  cm 2  V −1  s −1 ) and the SnO 2
(9.92 × 10 −4  cm 2  V −1  s −1 ). It is known that the electron mobility is a key figure-of-merit for ETLs in PSCs. Supplementary Fig.  5
shows the electron injection models for ITO/SnO 2
or E-SnO 2 /perovskite/PCBM/Al structures, with their corresponding
J –V
curves, and the details are described in Supplementary Note  2 . It is apparent that the high electron mobility effectively promotes electron transfer in the PSCs, reduces charge accumulation at the ETL/perovskite interface, improves efficiency, and suppresses hysteresis for the PSCs 21 . Perovskite growth mechanism The quality of the perovskite films, including grain size, crystallinity, surface coverage, etc., is very important for high-performance PSCs. For a consistent microstructure, a solution deposition technique was used to fabricate perovskite films on EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2
substrates. Figure  2a–c
shows the morphology of the perovskite films deposited on different ETLs. It is clear from these images that continuous pinhole-free films with full surface coverage were obtained. Figure  2d
shows the distribution diagram with an average grain size of about 309 nm for the perovskite coated on SnO 2 . The grain size increased to about 518 nm for the EDTA sample. Surprisingly, the average perovskite grain size is further enhanced to as much as about 828 nm (Fig.  2c, d ) for the E-SnO 2
substrates. Fig. 2 The morphology of perovskite films deposited on different substrates. Top-view scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of perovskite films coated on

The grain size distribution of perovskite deposited on various substrates Full size image According to the established model for nucleation and growth of thin films 52 , 53 , the perovskite formation process can be divided into four steps: (i) formation of a crystal nucleus, (ii) evolution of nuclei into an island structure, (iii) formation of a networked microstructure, and (iv) growth of networks into a continuous film. The Gibbs free energy for heterogeneous nucleation in the first step can be expressed as Eq. ( 1) $$\bigtriangleup G_{{\mathrm{heterogeneous}}} = \bigtriangleup G_{{\mathrm{homogeneous}}} \times f\left( \theta \right)$$
(1)
wherein
f ( θ ) = (2–3 cos  θ  + cos 3 θ )/4 54 , and
θ
is the contact angle of the precursor solution. Since the magnitude of
θ
varies in the range of [0,
π /2], the larger the
θ
is, the smaller is the magnitude of cos  θ , and therefore larger is the parameter
f ( θ ) ϵ [0, 1]. In other words, a smaller contact angle results in reduced Gibbs free energy for heterogeneous nucleation, thereby assisting the nucleation process. Higher nucleation density will promote the film densification process 53 . Compared to EDTA and SnO 2 , E-SnO 2
shows the smallest contact angle (20.67°, Supplementary Fig.  6 ), resulting in the wettability interface for the perovskite 55 , 56 , 57 . Thus, the perovskite coated on the E-SnO 2
exhibits better crystallinity (Supplementary Fig.  7 ) and full surface coverage (Fig.  2c ). In addition, the small contact angle of the substrate provides the low surface energy 58 , leading to increased grain size during the growth of the networked structure 53 , as observed in the SEM measurements. Charge transfer dynamics The electron-only devices with the structure of ITO/ETL/perovskite/PCBM/Ag were fabricated to evaluate the trap density of perovskite deposited on different substrates. Figure  3a
shows the dark current–voltage ( I–V ) curves of the electron-only devices. The linear correlation (dark yellow line) reveals an ohmic-type response at low bias voltage, when the bias voltage is above the kink point, which defines as the trap-filled limit voltage ( V TFL ), the current nonlinearly increases (cyan line), indicating that the traps are completely filled. The trap density ( N t ) can be obtained using Eq. ( 2) $$N_{\mathrm{t}} = \frac{{2\varepsilon _0\varepsilon V_{{\mathrm{TFT}}}}}{{eL^2}}$$

and EDTA substrates are 1.93 × 10 16
and 1.27 × 10 16  cm −3 , respectively. Interestingly, the trap density is reduced to as low as 8.97 × 10 15  cm −3
for the film deposited on E-SnO 2 . The significantly lower trap density is related to low grain boundary density in the perovskite film (Fig.  2 ). Fig. 3 The charge transfer between perovskite and different ETLs.

TRPL spectra with an excitation intensity of 3 μJ cm −2
of perovskite films deposited on different substrates Full size image Figure  3b
shows the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the perovskite deposited on different substrates. Compared with other samples, significant PL quench is observed in the ITO/E-SnO 2 /perovskite, demonstrating that the E-SnO 2
has the most appealing merits as the highest electron mobility (Fig.  1f ). Figure  3c
shows the normalized time-resolved PL (TRPL) for perovskite coated on various ETLs. The lifetime and the corresponding amplitudes are listed in Supplementary Table  1 . Generally, the slow decay component ( τ 1 ) is attributed to the radiative recombination of free charge carriers due to traps in the bulk, and the fast decay component ( τ 2 ) is originated from the quenching of charge carriers at the interface 60 . The glass/perovskite sample shows the longest lifetime under excitation intensity of 3 μJ cm −2 . For perovskite coated on the ITO substrate, the lifetime is decreased to more than half due to the charge transfer from perovskite into ITO. For EDTA/perovskite and SnO 2 /perovskite samples, both the fast and slow decay lifetimes are very similar, and
τ 1
dominates the PL decay for both samples, indicating severe recombination before they were extracted. When the perovskite is deposited on E-SnO 2 , both
τ 1
and
τ 2
were shortened to 14.16 ns and 0.97 ns, with a proportion of 45.32% and 54.68%, respectively. Meanwhile,
τ 2
appears to dominate the PL decay, indicating that electrons are effectively extracted from the perovskite layer to the E-SnO 2
with minimal recombination loss. Even under smaller excitation intensity (0.5 μJ cm −2 ), the acceleration of the lifetime for E-SnO 2 /perovskite is observed. The lifetime increases with reduced excitation intensity (Supplementary Fig.  8
and Supplementary Table  1 ), in agreement with a previous report 61 . The electron-transport yield ( Ф tr ) of different ETLs with different excitation intensities can be estimated using equation,
Ф tr  = 1 – τ p / τ glass , where
τ p
is the average lifetime for perovskite deposited on different substrates, and
τ glass
is the average lifetime for glass/perovskite. With the excitation intensity of 3 μJ cm −2 , the electron-transport yields of ITO, EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2
are 49.72%, 67.58%, 68.31%, and 81.50%, respectively. When the excitation intensity reduces to 0.5 μJ cm −2 , the electron-transport yields of ITO, EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2
are increased to 60.37%, 74.46%, 80.65%, and 90.82%, respectively. It is clear that the excitation intensity can significantly increase the electron- transport yield. These results further indicate that the E-SnO 2
is a good electron extraction layer for planar-type PSCs. The performance of PSCs With the superior optoelectronic properties discussed above, it is expected that the E-SnO 2
would make a better ETL in the PSCs than the SnO 2 . Planar-type PSCs are therefore designed and fabricated based on different ETLs with the device structure shown in Fig.  4a
inset. FAPbI 3
was used as the active absorber for its proper band gap, with a small amount of Cs doping to improve its phase stability 62 , 63 . Supplementary Fig.  9
presents the cross-sectional SEM images for the complete device structure. The thickness of the perovskite film is controlled at ca. 420 nm for all devices. While the perovskite grains are not large enough to penetrate through the film thickness when the SnO 2
is used as the substrate, the grains are significantly larger when deposited on EDTA and E-SnO 2
with the grains grown across the film thickness, which is consistent with top-view SEM results (Fig.  2 ). Fig. 4 PSC performance using ETLs.

The PCE distribution histogram of the planar-type PSCs based on different ETLs Full size image Figure  4a
shows the
J–V
curves of planar-type PSCs using different ETLs, with the key parameters, including short-circuit current density ( J sc ),
V oc , fill factor (FF), and PCE summarized in Table  1 . The device based on EDTA gives a PCE of 16.42% with
J sc  = 22.10 mA cm −2 ,
V oc  = 1.08 V, and FF = 0.687. The device based on SnO 2
substrate shows a PCE of 18.93% with
J sc  = 22.79 mA cm −2 ,
V oc  = 1.10 V, and FF = 0.755. Interestingly, when the E-SnO 2
is employed as ETL, the
J sc , FF, and
V oc
are increased to 24.55 mA cm −2 , 0.792, and 1.11 V, yielding a PCE up to 21.60%, (the certified efficiency is 21.52%, and the certificated document is shown in Supplementary Fig.  10 ), the highest efficiency reported to date for the planar-type PSCs. The low device performance for the EDTA is caused by small
J sc
and FF, which is related to low electron mobility and high resistance 47 , and the low
V oc
results from the small offset of Fermi energy between the EDTA and HTL (Fig.  1d ) 64 . In comparison, the planar-type PSCs with E-SnO 2
ETLs exhibit the best performance. The higher
J sc
and FF are attributed to the high electron mobility that promotes effective electron extraction, and the larger
V oc
due to the closer energy level between E-SnO 2
and perovskite 65 . Figure  4b
shows the incident-photon-to-charge conversion efficiency (IPCE) and the integrated current of the PSCs based on different ETLs. The integrated current values calculated by the IPCE spectra for the devices using EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2
are 21.22, 21.58, and 24.15 mA cm −2 , respectively, very close to the
J –V
results. It is apparent that the device based on the E-SnO 2
shows significantly higher IPCE due to less optical loss when perovskite is deposited on E-SnO 2
ETL (Supplementary Fig.  11 ), consistent with the
J–V
measurement. Table 1 The parameters of the rigid and flexible devices Full size table To further demonstrate the device characteristics, photocurrent density of the champion devices from each group based on EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2
was measured when the devices were biased at 0.85, 0.89, and 0.92 V, respectively. Figure  4c
shows the corresponding curves at the maximum power point ( V mp ) in the
J –V
plots. The PCEs of the champion devices using the EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2
stabilize at 16.34%, 18.67%, and 21.67% with photocurrent densities of 19.22, 20.98, and 23.55 mA cm −2 , respectively, very close to the values measured from the
J –V
curves. Next, we fabricated and measured 30 individual devices for each ETL to study repeatability. Figure  4d
shows the PCE distribution histogram for devices with different ETLs, with the statistics listed in Supplementary Tables  2 – 4 . Amazingly, the devices based on E-SnO 2
exhibit excellent repeatability with a very small standard deviation in contrast to the devices based on EDTA and SnO 2 , indicating that the E-SnO 2
is an excellent ETL in the planar-type PSC. In order to gain further insight into the charge transport mechanism, the charge transfer processes in the perovskite devices were studied in detail. The carrier recombination rate in the PSCs was evaluated by the
V oc
decay measurements. Figure  5a
shows the
V oc
decay curves of the PSCs based on different ETLs. It is apparent that the planar-type PSC based on E-SnO 2
exhibits the slowest
V oc
decay time compared to the devices based on EDTA and SnO 2 , indicating that the devices with E-SnO 2
have the lowest charge recombination rate and the longest carrier lifetime, consistent with the highest
V oc
for the device based on E-SnO 2
by
J–V
measurements. Figure  5b
shows
J sc
versus light intensity of the PSCs using various ETLs. It appears that all devices show a linear correlation with the slopes very close to 1, indicating that the bimolecular recombination in the devices is negligible 66 . Figure  5c
shows that
V oc
changes linearly with the light intensity. Prior studies have indicated that the deviation between the slope and the value of ( kT/q ) reflects the trap-assisted recombination 20 . In the present case, the device using the E-SnO 2
shows the smallest slope, indicating the least trap-assisted recombination, which is in excellent agreement with the result showing the lowest trap density when the perovskite is deposited on E-SnO 2
(Fig.  3a ). In fact, the slope is as small as 1.02
kT/q , implying that the trap-assisted recombination is almost negligible. Fig. 5 Charge transfer properties of the planar-type PSCs using different ETLs.

EIS of planar-type PSCs with various ETLs Full size image The electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to extract transfer resistance in the solar cells. Figure  5d
shows the Nyquist plots of the devices using different ETLs measured at
V oc
under dark conditions, with the equivalent circuit shown in Supplementary Fig.  12 . It is known that in the EIS analysis, the high-frequency component is the signature of the transfer resistance ( R tr ) and the low-frequency one for the recombination resistance ( R rec ) 67 . In the present study, because the perovskite/HTL interface is identical for all devices, the only variable affecting
R tr
is the perovskite/ETL interface. The numerical fitting gives the device parameters, as listed in Supplementary Table  5 . Apparently, compared to PSCs based on EDTA and SnO 2 , the device with E-SnO 2
shows the smallest
R tr
of 14.8 Ω and the largest
R rec
of 443.3 Ω. The small
R tr
is beneficial for electron extraction, and the large
R rec
effectively resists charge recombination, which is in agreement with the observations discussed above. Combined, all the results confirm that E-SnO 2
is the most effective ETL for the planar-type PSC. Stability and hysteresis Stability and hysteresis are two key characteristics for the PSCs. Figure  6a
shows normalized PCE measured as a function of storage time, with more detailed
J–V
parameters summarized in Supplementary Table  6 . It is clear that while the device based on E-SnO 2
maintains 92% of its initial efficiency exposed to an ambient atmosphere after 2880 h in the dark, the device using SnO 2
only provides 74% of its initial efficiency under the same storage condition. The PSCs were also tested under continuous irradiation at 100 mW cm −2 . Figure  6b
shows the normalized PCE changes as a function of test time, with more detailed
J–V
parameters provided in Supplementary Table  7 . It is clear that after 120 h of illumination, the device using the E-SnO 2
maintains 86% of its initial efficiency, while for the same test duration, the device using SnO 2
remains only 38% relative to its initial efficiency. It is apparent that the device fabricated on E-SnO 2
shows excellent stability under both the dark and continuous irradiation. The instability of PSC is mainly caused by degradation of the perovskite film and spiro-OMeTAD HTL. In the present work, all devices used the same spiro-OMeTAD HTL, therefore, the degradation from the HTL should be the same for all the devices. It is found that the grain size of the perovskite film is increased by three times when it is deposited on E-SnO 2
in comparison to that on the pristine SnO 2
(Fig.  2 ). The larger grain size can effectively suppress the moisture permeation at grain boundaries 68 , resulting in improved environmental stability for the PSCs based on the E-SnO 2
ETLs. Fig. 6 Stability and hysteresis test for planar-type PSCs. Long-term stability measurements of devices without any encapsulation under

and d show the
J–V
curves measured under both reverse- and forward- scan directions. It is found that the device with E-SnO 2
has almost identical
J–V
curves with negligible hysteresis, even when it is measured using different scan rates from 0.01 to 0.5 V s −1 . Supplementary Fig.  13
presents
J–V
curves measured for the device based on E-SnO 2
at different scan rates. It is apparent that the
J–V
curves almost remain the same, regardless of scan rate and direction, demonstrating that the hysteresis is negligible. Generally, the hysteresis of PSCs is ascribed to interfacial capacitance caused by charge accumulation at the interface, which originates from ion migration, high trap density, and unbalanced charge transport within the perovskite device 69 , 70 , 71 . It is found that the trap density of the perovskite film is significantly reduced when it is deposited on the E-SnO 2 , one of the primary reasons for reduced hysteresis. In addition, the electron mobility of the SnO 2
ETL is only 9.92 × 10 −4  cm 2  V −1  s −1
(Fig.  1f ), about an order of magnitude slower than the hole mobility of the doped spiro-OMeTAD (ca. 10 −3  cm 2  V −1  s −1 ) HTL. Thus, the electron flux ( F e ) is ca. 10 times smaller than the hole flux ( F h ) due to the same interface area of the ETL/perovskite and perovskite/HTL, that leads to charge accumulation at the SnO 2 /perovskite interface, as shown in Supplementary Fig.  14a . The accumulated charge would cause hysteresis in the solar cells (Fig.  6c ). When the high electron mobility E-SnO 2
(2.27 × 10 −3  cm 2  V −1  s −1 ) is employed as the ETL, the
F e
is comparable to the
F h
of the spiro-OMeTAD HTL (Supplementary Fig.  14b ), resulting in equivalent charge transport at both electrodes. Therefore, the high electron mobility of E-SnO 2
would enhance electron transport from perovskite to E-SnO 2
ETL, leading to no significant charge accumulation, and consequently, the devices based on the E-SnO 2
exhibit negligible hysteresis. High-efficiency flexible PSCs Given the advantage of low-temperature preparation, we applied the E-SnO 2
ETL in flexible PSCs. Figure  7a
shows
J–V
curves of flexible PSCs using the poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET)/ITO substrates, with key
J–V
parameters summarized in Table  1 . The champion flexible device exhibits PCE of 18.28% ( J sc  = 23.42 mA cm −2 ,
V oc  = 1.09 V, and FF = 0.716). The lower
J sc
of the flexible device is caused by the lower transparency of the PET/ITO substrate compared to the glass/ITO used for the rigid device (Supplementary Fig.  15 ). The lower
V oc
and FF are likely due to higher sheet resistance of the PET/ITO substrate 67 . Figure  7c
shows the IPCE and integral current density of the flexible device. It is clear that the integral current is 23.12 mA cm −2 , in perfect agreement with the
J–V
results. For the reproducibility test, 30 individual cells were fabricated with the PCE distribution histogram shown in Fig.  7d
and detailed parameters are summarized in Supplementary Table  8 , both confirming very good reproducibility. Fig. 7 The performance of flexible PSCs based on E-SnO 2

The PCE distribution histogram of the flexible PSCs Full size image The mechanical stability is an important quality indicator for the flexible solar cells. According to a previous report 72 , it is safe for ITO to be bended to a radius of 14 mm, and when the bending radius is smaller than 14 mm, the ITO layer starts to crack, leading to significant degradation in conductivity. In order to examine the mechanical stability of the flexible PSCs, we therefore adopted the bending radii of 14 mm, 12 mm, and 7 mm to test the flexible device. Figure  7a
shows device performance of the flexible solar cells measured after flexing for 500 times with different curvature radii, and the test procedure is shown in Fig.  7b . It shows that after flexing for 500 times at a bending radius of 14 mm, the
J–V
curve and the associated parameters remain the same without obvious degradation. However, when the bending radius is decreased to 12 mm and 7 mm, the PCE degraded to 17.82% and 16.84%, respectively, attributing to the conductivity degradation of ITO 72 . Discussion An effective E-SnO 2
ETL has been developed, and the PCE of planar-type PSCs is increased to 21.60% with negligible hysteresis, and the certified efficiency is 21.52%, this is the highest reported value for planar-type PSCs so far. By taking advantage of low-temperature processing for E-SnO 2
ETLs, flexible devices with high PCE of 18.28% are also fabricated. The significant performance of the planar-type PSCs is attributed to the superior advantages when perovskite is deposited on E-SnO 2
ETLs, including larger grain size, lower trap density, and good crystallinity. The higher electron mobility facilitates electron transfer for suppressed charge accumulation at the interface, leading to high efficiency with negligible
J–V
hysteresis. Furthermore, the long-term stability is significantly enhanced since the large grain size that suppressed perovskite degradation at grain boundaries. This work provides a promising direction toward developing high-quality ETLs, and we believe that the present work will facilitate transition of perovskite photovoltaics. Methods Materials NH 2 CHNH 2 I (FAI) was synthesized and purified according to a reported procedure 45 . The SnO 2
solution was purchased from Alfa Aesar (tin (IV) oxide, 15 wt% in H 2 O colloidal dispersion). PbI 2
(purity > 99.9985%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. EDTA (purity > 99.995%), CsI (purity > 99.999%), dimethylformamide (DMF, purity > 99%), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, purity > 99%) were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. In total, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis( N , N -di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) was bought from Yingkou OPV Tech Co., Ltd. All of the other solvents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich without any purification. Fabrication of EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2
films The 0.2-mg EDTA was dissolved in 1 mL of deionized water, and the SnO 2
aqueous colloidal dispersion (15 wt%) was diluted using deionized water to the concentration of 2.5 wt%. These solutions were stirred at room temperature for 2 h. The SnO 2
and EDTA layers were fabricated by spin-coating at 5000 rpm for 60 s using the corresponding solution, and then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C under ca. 5 Pa for 30 min to remove residual solvent. The EDTA and SnO 2
solution were mixed with a volume ratio of 1:1, then put on a hot plate at 80 °C for 5 h under stirring conditions, and the milky-white E-SnO 2
colloidal solution (Supplementary Fig.  1b ) was obtained. The E-SnO 2
colloidal solution was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 60 s, and then transferred the samples into a vacuum oven at 60 °C under ca. 5 Pa for 30 min to remove the residual solvent. Finally, the E-SnO 2
films were obtained. Electron mobility of EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2
films To gain insights into the charge transport, we have measured electron mobility using different ETLs in the same device structure. Specifically, the electron-only device was designed and fabricated using ITO/Al/ETL/Al structure, as shown in the inset in Fig.  1f . In this analysis, we assumed that the current is only related to electrons. When the effects of diffusion and the electric field are neglected, the current density can be determined by the SCLC 73 . The thickness of 80-nm Al was deposited on ITO substrates by thermal evaporation, and then the different ETLs were spin-coated on ITO/Al. Finally, 80-nm-thick Al was deposited on ITO/Al/ETL samples. The dark
J –V
curves of the devices were performed on a Keithley 2400 source at ambient conditions. The electron mobility ( μ e ) is extracted by fitting the
J –V
curves using the Mott–Gurney law (3) $$\mu _{\mathrm{e}} = \frac{{8JL^3}}{{9\varepsilon _0\varepsilon \left( {V_{{\mathrm{app}}} - V_{\mathrm{r}} - V_{{\mathrm{bi}}}} \right)^2}}$$

Fabrication of solar cells The perovskite absorbers were deposited on different ETL substrates using one-step solution processed. In total, 240.8 mg of FAI, 646.8 mg of PbI 2 , and 18.2 mg of CsI were dissolved in 1 mL of DMF and DMSO (4:1, volume/volume), with stirring at 60 °C for 2 h. The precursor solution was spin-coated on the EDTA, SnO 2
and E-SnO 2
substrates. The spin-coated process was divided by a consecutive two-step process, the spin rate of the first step is 1000 rpm for 15 s with accelerated speed of 200 rpm, and the spin rate of the second step is 4000 rpm for 45 s with accelerated speed of 1000 rpm. During the second step end of 15 s, 200 μL of chlorobenzene was drop-coated to treat the perovskite films, and then the perovskite films were annealed at 100 °C for 30 min in a glovebox. After cooling down to room temperature, the spiro-OMeTAD solution was coated on perovskite films at 5000 rpm for 30 s with accelerated speed of 3000 rpm. The 1-mL HTL chlorobenzene solution contains 90 mg of spiro-OMeTAD, 36 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine, and 22 μL of lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide of 520 mg mL −1
in acetonitrile. The samples were retained in a desiccator overnight to oxidate the spiro-OMeTAD. Finally, 100-nm-thick Au was deposited using thermal evaporation. The device area of 0.1134 cm 2
was determined by a metal mask. Characterization The
J–V
curves of the PSCs were measured using a Keithley 2400 source under ambient conditions at room temperature. The light source was a 450-W xenon lamp (Oriel solar simulator) with a Schott K113 Tempax sunlight filter (Praezisions Glas & Optik GmbH) to match AM1.5 G. The light intensity was 100 mW cm −2
calibrated by a NREL-traceable KG5-filtered silicon reference cell. The active area of 0.1017 cm 2
was defined by a black metal aperture to avoid light scattering into the device, and the aperture area was determined by the MICRO VUE sol 161 instrument. The
J–V
curves for PSCs were tested both at reverse scan (from 2 to −0.1 V, step 0.02 V) and forward scan (from −0.1 to 2 V, step 0.02 V), and the scan rate was selected from 0.01 to 0.5 V s −1 . There was no preconditioning before the test. The IPCE was implemented on the QTest Station 2000ADI system (Crowntech. Inc., USA). AFM height images were attained by a Bruker Multimode 8 in tapping mode. KPFM was carried out on Bruker Metrology Nanoscope VIII AFM in an ambient atmosphere. The TRPL spectra were performed on an Edinburgh Instruments FLS920 fluorescence spectrometer. SEM images were gained by a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SU8020) under an accelerating voltage of 2 kV. XPS measurements were performed on an AXISULTRA X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The optical transmission was acquired by a Hitachi U-3900 spectrophotometer.

Abstract Defects play an important role in the degradation processes of hybrid halide perovskite absorbers, impeding their application for solar cells. Among all defects, halide anion and organic cation vacancies are ubiquitous, promoting ion diffusion and leading to thin-film decomposition at surfaces and grain boundaries. Here, we employ fluoride to simultaneously passivate both anion and cation vacancies, by taking advantage of the extremely high electronegativity of fluoride. We obtain a power conversion efficiency of 21.46% (and a certified 21.3%-efficient cell) in a device based on the caesium, methylammonium (MA) and formamidinium (FA) triple-cation perovskite (Cs 0.05 FA 0.54 MA 0.41 )Pb(I 0.98 Br 0.02 ) 3
treated with sodium fluoride. The device retains 90% of its original power conversion efficiency after 1,000 h of operation at the maximum power point. With the help of first-principles density functional theory calculations, we argue that the fluoride ions suppress the formation of halide anion and organic cation vacancies, through a unique strengthening of the chemical bonds with the surrounding lead and organic cations.

Inhibition of halide oxidation and deprotonation of organic cations with dimethylammonium formate for air-processed p–i–n perovskite solar cells

26 February 2024
Main Organic–inorganic halide perovskites (ABX 3 , where A is an organic cation, such as methylamine (MA) or formamidine (FA); B is lead or tin; X is a halide ion) have emerged as exciting new materials for solar cells due to their unique combination of properties, such as strong light absorption 1 , superb charge carrier mobility 2
and low-cost fabrication 3 . Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have risen from 3.8% to a certified 23.7% 1 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , close to that of crystalline silicon solar cells. In spite of the unparalleled growth in photovoltaic performance, the industrial application of PSCs is hampered by instability issues. One of the main sources of the instability is the defect chemistry of perovskites. In particular, owing to the ionic nature of perovskite materials 11 , as well as their solution-based fabrication processes, numerous defects are formed at the surfaces and grain boundaries of polycrystalline perovskite films 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 . In particular, point defects such as halide anion vacancies and organic cation vacancies are easily produced in perovskite materials due to their low formation energies 16 , 17 , 18 . Although these defects mostly create shallow electronic levels near the band edges 8 , 19 , they still have profound unwanted effects on carrier dynamics and the
I – V
hysteresis of PSCs 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 . Even more importantly, such defects are believed to play an important role in the chemical degradation of the perovskite material and of the interfaces with the charge transport layers, leading to long-term instability of the PSCs 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 . Ion vacancies diffuse into the crystallites, and promote the diffusion of cations and anions to the surfaces and grain boundaries. Decomposition reactions at these locations, such as evaporation of the organic species MA or FA, then lead to degradation of the material. Therefore, control and mitigation of the number of organic cation or halide anion vacancies has become an important research direction towards more efficient and stable PSCs. As organic components such as MA or FA easily evaporate from the surface during the thermal annealing process 11 , 28 , thereby creating organic cation vacancies, one way to suppress the formation of such vacancies is to use excess MA/FA during or after the perovskite annealing process 29 . Another approach to prevent the formation of organic cation vacancies is to create a two-dimensional layered structure by introducing a small amount of larger organic molecules, such as phenethylamine, polyethylenimine and trifluoroethylamine, which are difficult to evaporate 30 . Similar methods have also been reported to be effective for passivating or suppressing halide anion vacancies 8 , 31 , 32 . Previously, iodide ions have been introduced into the organic cation solution, which decreases the concentration of iodide vacancies 8 . Elsewhere, guanidinium, an organic ion that probably forms hydrogen bonds, has been used to suppress the formation of iodide vacancies 31 . Addition of KI to perovskites has also demonstrated a positive effect of small alkali ions on passivating I −
vacancies, which consequently improves the efficiency and stability of PSCs 33 , 34 , 35 . In addition, small ions (Cl and Cd) were doped into the perovskite lattice to suppress the formation of halide vacancies via lattice strain relaxation 26 . Although significant advances have been made in defect engineering of the bulk and grain boundaries of perovskites, most strategies focus on passivating or preventing only one type of defect, either the organic cation or the halide anion vacancy. Only recently, choline chloride was used to passivate both positive and negative charged defects by quaternary ammonium and halide ions 11 . This ‘charged components compensation’ provides a possible method of multi-vacancy defects passivation. Here we report a chemical bonding modulation of perovskite films by tuning the bond strength of the additives with the perovskites. We start from the state-of-the-art triple-cation perovskite (Cs 0.05 FA 0.54 MA 0.41 )Pb(I 0.98 Br 0.02 ) 3
absorber and add a small amount of alkali halide, NaX (X = I, Br, Cl or F), using a two-step solution process (for details, see
Methods ). Although all alkali halides improve the quality of the perovskite, the fluoride-containing material gives by far the best performance. Planar n–i–p solar cells made on the basis of the fluoride-containing perovskite yield a PCE of 21.46% (and a certified 21.3%-efficient solar cell). More importantly, non-encapsulated PSCs using the fluoride-containing materials exhibit an excellent long-term stability. They retain 90% of their original PCE after 1,000 h of continuous illumination under maximum power point (MPP) operating conditions, or under thermal stress of 85 °C. From results obtained with a wide range of experimental characterization techniques and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we argue that the fluoride ions are very effective in passivating both the organic cation and halide anion vacancies by forming strong hydrogen bonds (N–H···F) with organic cations (MA/FA) and strong ionic bonds with lead in the perovskite films. Properties of CsFAMA-X films Passing through the halide series I, Br, Cl and F (Fig.
1a ), the electronegativity increases and the ionic radius becomes smaller. This leads to an increased chemical bonding between the halide anions with the A and B cations. In the following, we first compare the properties of the (Cs 0.05 FA 0.54 MA 0.41 )Pb(I 0.98 Br 0.02 ) 3
perovskite, modified by adding 0.1% NaX (X = I, Br, Cl, or F), to those of the unmodified perovskite as a reference. We denote the reference perovskite as ‘CsFAMA’ and the NaX-containing perovskite as ‘CsFAMA-X’.

shows the reflectance micro-Fourier transform infrared spectra of CsFAMA and CsFAMA-X films. Compared to the reference CsFAMA, the spectrum of the CsFAMA-F film shows a substantial shift of the N–H vibration modes (3,500–3,350 cm −1 ) towards a lower wavenumber. This kind of shift is absent in the CsFAMA-X (X = I, Br, Cl) samples. We attribute this shift to the formation of hydrogen bonds N–H···F between the FA/MA and F species 36 . This hydrogen bond results in a delocalization of the electronic cloud of the N–H bond. It weakens the N–H chemical bond, which decreases the corresponding vibrational frequency. Our solid-state
1 H NMR measurements also confirm the formation of hydrogen bonds between the fluoride and the MA ions, as evidenced by the larger chemical shift of NH 3
protons in the CsFAMA-F sample (Supplementary Fig.
1 ). These experimental findings are supported by DFT calculations (Supplementary Fig.
2 ). Our calculations show that the presence of a fluoride ion at the surface induces the reorientation of several adjacent FA cations, and the formation of N–H···F hydrogen bonds. As a result, the stretching modes of the corresponding N–H groups shift to lower frequencies. Averaged over the stretching modes of all N–H groups of the affected FA ions, this leads to an overall shift of 63 cm −1 . DFT results also indicate that the inclusion of a sodium ion has negligible effects on these vibration modes, confirming that fluoride is responsible for the change in the vibration dynamics of the FA cations. As we will discuss later, the strong fluoride–organic cation interaction significantly stabilizes the perovskite surface and suppresses the formation of organic cation vacancies. The effects of NaX additives on the optical properties and the structure of the perovskite thin films are carefully investigated by a range of techniques. The bandgap of the CsFAMA-X films is the same as that of the reference CsFAMA, according to ultraviolet–visible and photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig.
1c ). Neither shifts in the peaks, nor new peaks are observed in the X-ray diffraction patterns (Supplementary Fig.
3 ), indicating that addition of NaX does not alter the crystal structure of the perovskite films. Whereas these basic optical and crystal structural properties of all CsFAMA-X films are similar, time-resolved PL (TRPL) results (Fig.
1d
and Supplementary Table
1 ) reveal an important difference in the lifetime of free charge carriers between the CsFAMA and the CsFAMA-X films. The CsFAMA-F sample exhibits carrier lifetimes (τ 1 : 97.16 ns, τ 2 : 401.64 ns) that are much longer than those of the CsFAMA reference ( τ 1 : 30.82 ns,
τ 2 : 193.29 ns). In contrast, the carrier lifetimes of the other CsFAMA-X (X = I, Br, Cl) samples are much closer to those of the reference. This implies that non-radiative recombination is effectively suppressed by the addition of fluoride. It should be noted here that another difference between the CsFAMA-X films can be found from field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images (Fig.
1f ). We observe that CsFAMA-Cl and CsFAMA-F films exhibit a slightly larger grain size than that of CsFAMA-Br and CsFAMA-I, which is probably due to the fact that the chloride and fluoride may influence the crystal nucleation and crystallization kinetics of perovskites (Supplementary Figs.
4
and
5 ). As shown from the TRPL results above and thermal stability properties in the following paragraph, the effect of the NaF additive is much more pronounced than that of NaCl, implying that the larger grain size, while a contributing factor, does not explain all of the improvements found in CsFAMA-F films. We explore the thermal stability of the perovskite films by maintaining them at 85  ο C in a nitrogen atmosphere, followed by a thermal annealing at 100 °C in air. During these ageing tests, we monitor the relative content of PbI 2
via X-ray diffraction patterns (Supplementary Fig.
3 ), given that PbI 2
is one of the known decomposition products of perovskites. Figure
1e
summarizes the relative X-ray diffraction intensity of PbI 2
and perovskite in the films. Clearly the CsFAMA-F film has a much lower PbI 2
content than all of the other films, which confirms the outstanding thermal stability of this material. The main degradation reactions caused by thermal stress are the deprotonation and desorption of volatile organic cations 37 . The improvement in thermal stability observed in the CsFAMA-F sample is attributed to the hydrogen bonds between the fluoride and MA/FA ions inhibiting the diffusion and dissociation of organic cations. In short, of the halide salts studied, NaF enables the greatest improvements in terms of thermal stability and carrier lifetimes in CsFAMA perovskites. Therefore, in the following, we focus on CsFAMA-F and the role played by the fluoride in the context of photovoltaics performance of solar cells made with this material. Possible location of fluoride and its passivation effects To investigate the presence and distribution of NaF in the perovskite film, time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS) is employed to probe the depth profiles of the atomic species in the CsFAMA-F perovskite sample (Fig.
2a ). The maximum signals of Na and F are observed on the surface of the perovskite thin film and at the perovskite/ITO interface. Nevertheless, signals with appreciable intensity are observed along the entire film thickness. The presence of NaF in the film is also confirmed by the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy results, as shown in Supplementary Fig.
6 . As no significant peak shifts are observed in X-ray diffraction results, it rules out the possibility of NaF entering the CsFAMA crystal lattice (Supplementary Fig.
3 ). As analysed above, we therefore suggest that NaF is indeed in the film, possibly concentrated at the surface, as illustrated by Fig.
2b . Fig. 2: Surface and bulk characterization of perovskite films. a , ToF-SIMS depth profile analysis of a CsFAMA-F perovskite sample.

c
and
d . Full size image To probe the effect of NaF at the surface of the perovskite film, we apply scanning Kelvin probe microscopy 38 , 39 , and combine a three-dimensional spatial map of the topography and a map of the surface potential. In the reference sample (CsFAMA), the surface potential at the boundaries of the grains is 40 mV higher than in the middle of the grains (see Fig.
2c ). In the CsFAMA-F sample (Fig.
2d ), this surface potential difference is only about 20 mV. We conclude that NaF modifies the surface potential (Supplementary Fig.
7 ), which further suggests that NaF species are probably located at the surface. To gather more atomistic information regarding the possible location of NaF and its effect on the stability of the perovskite, we calculate the relative energies of incorporation of Na and F ions in the bulk and on surfaces, using DFT. The Na ion is found to be more stable on surfaces than in the bulk by 0.2 to 0.3 eV. On both FAI- and PbI 2 -terminated surfaces, Na preferentially occupies an interstitial site, rather than an A site (Supplementary Fig.
8 ). A detailed chemical analysis (Fig.
3c ) shows that incorporation of a Na ion increases the ionic charge on the nearby I ions. It indicates that Na may play a role in suppressing the diffusion of halide ions. Fig. 3: Location of Na and F ions and effects on chemical bonding strength and formation energy of FA vacancies. a , b , Optimized structures of a Na–I unit ( a ) and a Na–F unit ( b ) adjacent to the FAPbI 3
surface. The yellow, blue, purple, black, grey, brown and orange spheres denote the Na, F, I, Pb, N, C and H ions, respectively.
c , Net atomic charges of I and Pb ions on the FAPbI 3
surface with incorporation of NaI species (FA-I) or NaF species (FA–F), and without any incorporation (FA).
d , Formation energy of a surface FA vacancy in the clean FAPbI 3
(FA), and in the NaI (FA–I) or NaF (FA–F) species incorporated surfaces. Full size image We find that incorporating a F ion into the perovskite lattice is extremely difficult, and it has a strong preference for staying at the surface. By far the most energetically favourable position of a F ion is substitution of an I ion at an FAI-terminated surface. Positions of F ions either in the perovskite bulk, or in a PbI 2 -terminated surface, have an energy that is about 3.5 eV higher (Supplementary Fig.
9 ). The size mismatch between I and F ions probably prevents the latter from being incorporated comfortably inside the perovskite lattice, as it would induce too much strain. This is avoided by incorporating F ions on the FAI surface. However, the incorporation of F ions on the FAI surface changes the local bonding at the surface and subsurface layers. The most dramatic change is that the FA cations surrounding a F site reorient towards the F ion, in such a way as to maximize their interactions with this ion (Fig.
3a,b ). This is in agreement with the N–H vibration mode analysis discussed above (Fig.
1b
and Supplementary Fig.
2 ), supporting the finding that FA ions closest to a F site form hydrogen bonds with the F ion. In addition, the ionic charge on the Pb ions surrounding a F site also increases (Fig.
3c ), indicating that the F ions form stronger ionic bonds. In summary, the introduction of F at FAI-terminated surfaces stabilizes the local structure via increased bonding with Pb, and via hydrogen bonds with FA ions. To further elucidate the effect of incorporation of F ions, we calculate the formation energies of FA cation vacancies on the surface of the clean perovskite, and that on the surfaces incorporated with NaI or NaF species (Fig.
3d
and Supplementary Fig.
10 ). Whereas the FA vacancy formation energy close to a NaI species increases by a mere 0.12 eV, compared to the pristine perovskite, close to a F ion it increases by a sizeable 0.55 eV. The presence of F therefore significantly prevents the formation of FA vacancies at the surface. This result supports the excellent thermal stability of the CsFAMA-X perovskite films (Fig.
1e ), where the creation of organic cation vacancies is typically believed to be responsible for the degradation of the perovskites under thermal stress. Solar cell performance To investigate the photovoltaics performance based on our improved material, we fabricate n–i–p planar PSCs using CsFAMA and CsFAMA-F perovskites as the absorbers. The cross-sectional SEM image in Fig.
4a
shows the device structure, which comprises an ITO glass substrate covered by a 50-nm-thick SnO 2
electron transport layer. On top of that we deposit a 600-nm-thick perovskite film, covered with a layer of Spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transport layer (200 nm), and an 80-nm-thick gold electrode as the back contact. Fig. 4: Performance of PSCs. a , A cross-sectional SEM image.

1
and shown in Fig.
4b , the CsFAMA-F cells give rise to a PCE of 21.46% (average value from reverse and forward scan results) with negligible
J–V
hysteresis. This is to be compared to the reference CsFAMA with an average PCE of 19.03% with moderate
J–V
hysteresis. Examples of CsFAMA and CaFAMA-X cells with stabilized PCEs of 19.37% and 20.96%, respectively, are shown in Fig.
4c . The statistics of 60 devices with or without NaF are shown in Supplementary Fig.
11
and Supplementary Table
2 . The average PCEs for the CsFAMA and CaFAMA-F devices are 18.86% and 20.56%, respectively. The short-circuit current density ( J sc ) increases only slightly in CsFAMA-F cells (the spectral responses of the external quantum efficiency of these devices are shown in Supplementary Fig.
13 ), while the most dramatic enhancement is found in the open-circuit voltage ( V oc ) and fill factor (FF). We attribute this improvement to the immobilization of mobile ions and vacancy defects such as iodide and MA (FA) due to the incorporation of fluoride ions. The best CsFAMA-F device has been certified by a third party (Supplementary Fig.
12 ). The certified PCEs are 21.7% under the reverse scan direction (1.2 to −0.1 V) and 20.8% under the forward scan direction (−0.1 to 1.2 V), with a slow scan rate (33 mV s −1 ) under AM1.5G full-sun illumination (1,000 W m −2 ). This certified efficiency of 21.3% (average value from certified reverse and forward scan results) agrees well with measured performances in our own laboratory. Table 1 Photovoltaics parameters for the best CsFAMA solar cell and the best CsFAMA-F cell under the forward (−0.2 to 1.2 V) and reverse (1.2 to −0.2 V) scan directions Full size table To examine the effects of incorporation of NaF on the defects in the perovskite absorber, we use admittance spectroscopy, and conduct a Mott−Schottky analysis to analyse the defects profile. We first conduct temperature-dependent admittance spectroscopy measurements on the CsFAMA and CsFAMA-F devices with the temperature rising from 210 to 350 K without illumination (Supplementary Fig.
14a,b ). Subsequently, the defect activation energies ( E a ) in the CsFAMA and CsFAMA-F samples are calculated to be 0.275 and 0.201 eV, respectively (Fig.
4d ). The trap density-of-states distribution and their energy levels are presented in Fig.
4e . Incorporation of fluoride effectively reduces the energy level of trap states from 0.26 to 0.18 eV, as well as their density of states from 22.4 × 10 15
to 14.9 × 10 15
cm −3  eV −1 . We have further carried out PL quantum efficiency (PLQE) measurements. Figure
4f
shows that the CsFAMA-F sample has a higher PLQE compared to the CsFAMA sample. Moreover, its PLQE increases more rapidly with increasing laser intensity. Space-charge-limited current measurements, transient photovoltage, transient photocurrent decay experiments and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements all show agreement with our finding that NaF effectively passivates electronic defects in PSCs, which is responsible for the improved PCE (see Supplementary Notes
11 – 13
and Supplementary Figs.
15 – 17 ). To establish the stability of our improved CsFAMA-F material, we carry out a series of investigations on unencapsulated devices. The results of stability tests under continuous one-sun illumination, or at a fixed temperature of 85 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere, are shown in Fig.
5a,b . The photo-stability of CsFAMA-F-based cells is superior to that of the reference cells, maintaining 95% of their original PCE after 1,000 h of illumination. As shown in Fig.
5b , the thermal stability of F-containing devices shows an even more significant improvement. The CsFAMA-F-based devices retain 90% of their initial PCE after annealing at 85 °C for 1,000 h, while CsFAMA PSCs retain only 50% of their initial PCE. We attribute this to the excellent thermal stability of NaF-containing perovskite films (Fig.
1e ). Fig. 5: Stability performance of PSCs under various conditions. All devices are unencapsulated and CsFAMA devices are compared with NaF-containing devices.

in a nitrogen atmosphere. Note that the initial efficiencies of these PSCs are about 19% for CsFAMA, and 20% for CsFAMA-F. Full size image In addition, we probe the storage lifetime of devices in an environment with humidity of about 25%–45% at a temperature of about 25–40 °C (Fig.
5c ). The evolution of the normalized PCE shows that CsFAMA-F cells exhibit a significantly improved long-term stability, retaining 90% of their original PCE after over 6,000 h of storage in ambient air. Most importantly, we investigate the operational stability of unencapsulated devices under MPP tracking with a continuous one-sun irradiation in a nitrogen atmosphere (Fig.
5d ). The reference cells show a rapid loss of PCE (below 40% of the original PCE after working for 600 h), while the CsFAMA-F cell exhibits a long lifetime, retaining over 90% of its initial PCE after 1,000 h. In addition, we also investigate the operational stability of unencapsulated PSCs under MPP tracking with continuous light irradiation (solar simulator source, 100 mW cm −2 ) in air (Supplementary Fig.
18 ). It can be found that CsFAMA-F PSCs exhibit superior stability performance compared with reference cells (CsFAMA): the CsFAMA-F cells retain 85% of their PCE after 350 min, while the PCE of the CsFAMA reference cells drops below 60% in less than 50 min, which further confirms that the incorporation of NaF in the perovskite film brought about remarkable improvements in the long-term stability of PSCs. It is important to emphasize that the effect of NaF is different from that of other sodium halides NaX (X = Cl, Br, I). To demonstrate this, we fabricate PSCs based on CsFAMA absorbers treated with other sodium halides. The corresponding PCEs are then slightly improved compared to the untreated CsFAMA (Supplementary Fig.
19a ), which is in line with other reports 40 . However, these devices exhibit an obvious
J–V
hysteresis (larger hysteresis index), while the NaF-containing devices show an almost negligible
J–V
hysteresis (Supplementary Fig.
19b ). It is possible that the Na ion can penetrate the perovskite film under an external bias because of its small size 34
(about 0.102 nm). Mobile ions and their accumulation at interfaces are reported to be responsible for the
J–V
hysteresis 41 . When using NaF, however, Na is bonded more closely to F, and is therefore localized mostly. The above analysis emphasizes the uniqueness of fluoride to immobilize the counter ions, as compared to other halides. To test the generality of these findings, we also consider the use of KF as an additive. We fabricate KF-containing PSCs (CsFAMA-K), using the same procedure as for NaF-containing PSCs (CsFAMA-Na). Supplementary Fig.
20
shows that KF-containing PSCs exhibit almost the same PCE as NaF-containing PSCs. In addition, both KF- and NaF-containing PSCs show negligible hysteresis, indicating that KF is also effective in passivating both anions and cations for efficient and stable PSC devices. The analysis above highlights the fact that fluoride ions are desirable for both chemical and electronic passivation in perovskites, and can be combined with a number of alkali metals. Conclusions In summary, we have explored an effective approach for simultaneous passivation of both the cation and anion vacancy defects in perovskite materials via chemical bonding enhancement, to improve the efficiency and stability of PSCs. By adding NaF to the triple-cation perovskite absorber, we obtain a PCE of 21.46% (and a certified efficiency of 21.3%) in planar PSCs, which is among the top efficiencies for this type of solar cells. Without any encapsulation, these solar cells exhibit remarkable long-term stability, retaining 90% of their original PCE after 1,000 h under MPP operation conditions at continuous illumination. The addition of NaF also results in a superb thermal and environmental stability of materials as well as devices. It is found that NaF is indeed present in the perovskite film and forms hydrogen bonds with organic cations within the perovskite crystals, which effectively retards the diffusion of these cations and their dissociation. Fluoride ions also increase the ionic bonding, thus immobilizing both organic cations and halide anions. Passivating the surfaces and grain boundaries through increased chemical bonding, the fluoride ions effectively block the materials degradation pathway at the corresponding interfaces. The present passivation approach that makes use of the high electronegativity of F is generally applicable for improving the stability of perovskite materials by suppressing the formation of halide anion and organic cation vacancies. These findings provide a new approach to the fabrication of highly efficient and stable PSCs. Methods Materials Materials used in experiments include PbI 2
(99.999%, Sigma-Aldrich), CsI (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), NaF (AR 98%, Aladdin Industrial Corporation), spiro-OMeTAD (Lumtec), SnO 2
colloid precursor (Alfa Aesar, tin( iv ) oxide, 15% in H 2 O colloidal dispersion),
N , N -dimethylformamide (DMF; 99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO; 99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich), isopropanol (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), chlorobenzene (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), acetone (AR Beijing Chemical Works), ethanol (AR Beijing Chemical Works), aminomethane (CP Beijing Chemical Works), hydrogen iodide (57%, Aladdin Industrial Corporation) and ITO substrate (Shanghai B-Tree Tech. Consult.). MAX (MAI, MACl, MABr) and FAI were synthesized using the methods reported previously 42 . The details are as follows: 16 ml methylamine water solution (0.1 mol) was added to a 100 ml three-neck flask immersed in a water/ice bath. A certain amount (0.1 mol) of HX acid was slowly dropped into the bottle with continuous stirring. The mixture was refluxed for 2 h under a N 2
atmosphere. Subsequently, the solution was concentrated to a dry solid by using rotary evaporation at 80 °C. This crude product was re-dissolved into 20 ml ethanol, then 100 μl diethyl ether was slowly dropped along the bottle wall and a white product deposited. This recrystallization was repeated three times, and the obtained precipitate was dried in a vacuum oven for 10 h at 40 ℃. The final products were sealed in a N 2 -filled glovebox for future use. The synthesis procedure for FAI was similar to MAI, except that HI acid was added into an 8.8 g formamidine acetate (0.10 mol) ethanol solution. Solar cell device fabrication The ITO substrate was cleaned with ultrapure water, acetone, ethanol and isopropanol successively. After 45 min of ultraviolet–O 3
treatments, a SnO 2
nanocrystal solution was spin-coated on the substrate at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s to form a 50-nm-thick film, which was then annealed at 150 °C for 30 min in air. The reference perovskite film was fabricated by a two-step solution process: the PbI 2
(1.3 M, dissolved in DMF/DMSO (9:1, v/v)) mixed with 5% CsI was spin-coated on ITO/SnO 2
at 2,500 r.p.m. for 30 s and annealed at 70 °C for 1 min in a nitrogen glovebox. After cooling the PbI 2 -coated substrate to room temperature in a nitrogen glovebox, a mixed organic cation solution (MAI 0.12 M; MABr 0.05 M; MACl 0.07 M; FAI 0.23 M, dissolved in isopropanol) was spin-coated at 2,300 r.p.m. for 30 s and then annealed at 150 °C for 15 min in air. Then the HTM solution, in which a spiro-OMeTAD/chlorobenzene (75 mg ml −1 ) solution was employed with the addition of 35 μl Li-TFSI/acetonitrile (260 mg ml −1 ), and 30 μl 4-tertbutylpyridine, was deposited by spin-coating at 3,500 r.p.m. for 30 s. The device was finished by thermal evaporation of Au (80 nm) under vacuum. For the NaX-containing perovskite film, we dissolved a certain amount of NaX with DMF/DMSO (9:1, v/v), and used it as a solvent to dissolve the PbI 2
powder. The optimal content for NaF was about 0.1% mol relative to PbI 2
(Supplementary Fig.
21 ), and we assumed that all NaF added was successfully incorporated in the final perovskite films because of its high vaporization enthalpy. The other steps are all the same as for the reference sample. For PSC stability tests, we changed the organic cation solution components (MABr 0.05 M; MACl 0.07 M; FAI 0.35 M, dissolved in isopropanol), and the HTM solution was replaced by polymer-modified spiro-MeOTAD to achieve better performance and stability. The other steps are all the same as for the reference and NaF-containing perovskite films. Material characterization The morphology of perovskite and PbI 2
thin films and cross-sectional SEM image were measured using a cold field-emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-4800). The X-ray diffraction patterns were collected using a PANalytical X’Pert Pro X-ray powder diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation ( λ  = 1.54050 Å). PL was measured by the FLS980 (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd) with an excitation at 470 nm. The ultraviolet–visible absorption spectra were obtained using an UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectrophotometer (UV–vis DRS, Japan Hitachi UH4150). UPS measurements were carried out on an XPS AXIS Ultra DLD (Kratos Analytical). The transient photovoltage and transient photocurrent measurements were performed on a Molex 180081-4320 simulating one-sun working conditions, and the carriers were excited by a 532 nm pulse laser. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were determined on an electrochemical workstation (Zahner Company), employing light-emitting diodes (LEDs) driven by Export (Zahner Company). The thermal admittance spectroscopy analyses were conducted on a Zahner Zennium pro Electrochemical Workstation at various temperatures ( T  = 210–350 K) in the dark from 10 0
to 10 6  Hz. A small a.c. voltage of 50 mV was used, and the d.c. bias was kept at zero to avoid the influence of the ferroelectric effect for perovskite material during measurement. For temperature-dependent characterization, the sample was mounted in Cryo Industries Liquid Nitrogen Dewars with a Lake Shore model 335 cryogenic temperature controller. The current density–voltage characteristics of the perovskite devices were obtained using a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit under AM1.5G illumination at 1,000 W m −2
with a Newport Thermal Oriel 91192 1,000 W solar simulator. The shading mask and one of our best devices were sent to the National Institute of Metrology, China for certification. The active area was defined as 0.09408 cm 2 . External quantum efficiencies were measured by an Enli Technology EQE measurement system. Scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy was performed on perovskite samples in ambient conditions using an MFP 3D-Classic Scanning Probe Microscope (Asylum Research, Inc.). This technique relies on an a.c. bias applied to the tip to produce an electric force on the cantilever that is proportional to the potential difference between the tip and the sample. The scanning was carried out in a dual-pass scan mode; during the first scan the spatial variations in the surface potential were directly measured, and the second scang gives the workfunction by nulling the local electrostatic force gradient arising from the contact potential differences between the AFM tip and the sample surface. The conductive AFM probe was ASYELEC-01-R2 with a Ti/Ir coating and a resonant frequency of 75 kHz. The PLQE data were obtained from a three-step technique through the combination of a 445 nm continuous wave laser, a spectrometer, an optical fibre and an integrating sphere. Computational methods Since FA as a cation and I as an anion are the most abundant species in the experimentally studied (Cs 0.05 FA 0.54 MA 0.41 )Pb(I 0.98 Br 0.02 ) 3
system, the incorporation of Na and F ions at different locations on the surfaces and bulk was investigated using FAPbI 3
as a model system. The DFT-optimized lattice parameter of cubic FAPbI 3
is 6.360 Å. The surfaces were modelled using slab models consisting of (2 × 2) cells in the
x
and
y
direction and 5 repeating FAPbI 3
units constructed from the bulk structure with a vacuum of 15 Å in the
z
direction. Structural optimizations of all structures were performed using DFT implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package 43 , 44 . The Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof functional within the generalized gradient approximation was used 45 . The outermost
s ,
p
and
d
(in the case of Pb) electrons were treated as valence electrons, whose interactions with the remaining ions were modelled by pseudopotentials generated within the projector-augmented wave method 46 , 47 . During the structural optimization, all ions were allowed to relax. An energy cutoff of 500 eV and a
k -point scheme of 3 × 3 × 1 were used to achieve energy and force convergence of 0.1 meV and 20 meV Å −1 , respectively. Information on chemical bonding analysis and formation energies of FA +
vacancies in the reference, NaI- and NaF-containing perovskites is presented in Supplementary Notes

Abstract Further minimizing the defect state density in the semiconducting absorber is vital to boost the power conversion efficiency of solar cells approaching Shockley-Queisser limit. However, it lacks a general strategy to control the precursor chemistry for defects density reduction in the family of iodine based perovskite. Here the alkaline environment in precursor solution is carefully investigated as an effective parameter to suppress the incident iodine and affects the crystallization kinetics during film fabrication, via rationale adjustment of the alkalinity of additives. Especially, a ‘residual free’ weak alkaline is proposed not only to shrink the bandgap of the absorber by modulating the stoichiometry of organic cation, but also to improve the open circuit voltage in the resultant device. Consequently, the certified efficiency of 20.87% (Newport) is achieved with one of the smallest voltage deficits of 413 mV in the planar heterojunction perovskite solar cell.

Introduction Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have attracted broad attention 1 , owing to their low fabrication cost and intriguing optical and electronic properties 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . Impressively, it witnessed the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells boosted from 3.8% 6
to a certified 23.7% rapidly 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 . To enable a truly competitive PCE of perovskite solar cells as that of the most efficient inorganic counterpart, e.g., GaAs, it is required to further reduce their energy loss. This relies on the improved charge generation and mitigated non-radiative charge recombination within the complete device. With careful investigations on the absorber materials 11 , 12 , device configuration 13 , 14 , and relevant interfaces 15 , 16 , it is found that the intrinsic defect properties 17 , 18
in perovskite films influence the charge dynamics in the devices significantly. Halide perovskites are generally regarded as relatively soft ionic solids, which are prone to contain point defects 3 , 19
in polycrystalline films (e.g., vacancies, interstitials, and cation and anti-site substitutions). They often serve as the non-radiative recombination centers to affect the quantum efficiency of photoluminescence and deteriorate the photovoltaic performance 17 , 20 . Therefore, to assure the best power output by reducing energy and voltage loss, it is of great importance to gain profound understanding on the defect physics and chemistry, which results in defects elimination in perovskite films for efficient photo-carrier transport. During the past few years, efforts have been attempted to probe the defects to unveil their nature. In the methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI 3 ) perovskite, it reported a variety of shallow native point defects, e.g., Pb vacancies (V Pb ), MA vacancies (V MA ), interstitials MA (MA i ), etc 3 ., and deep energy-level defects 2
in forms of complex and derivatives, such as interstitials I (I i ) and its derivatives 21 , 22 . In mixed perovskites, it reveals even more complicated defect physics, wherein formamidinium (FA)-related defect I FA
(the complexes of I i
and V FA ) makes a transition at a Fermi level that sits deep within the bandgap 19 . Furthermore, defect formation is reported to be correlated to the processing conditions, wherein films grown under iodine-rich conditions exhibit a higher defect density 23 . Among all defects, iodine-related defects receive most interest. It is reported that polyiodide complexes in dimethylformamide (DMF) solution could easily induce defects due to a nonstoichiometric Pb/I ratio in the resultant films 24 . When dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was further introduced, either I-rich or I-deficient intermediates were identified, depending on the ratio of the starting materials 25 . Recently, it demonstrated iodine redox chemistry to convert hole traps into electron traps possibly by oxidation during film processing 26 . Subsequently, the iodide management was proposed to effectively decrease the concentration of mid-gap defects in the perovskite films, and improve the PCEs of perovskite solar cells 27 , 28 , 29 . Yet, it lacks a feasible approach to be universally adopted in various halide perovskites, which suppresses the incidental I 2
in the absorber for enhanced device performance with reduced energy and voltage loss. In this work, we demonstrate a universal technique to suppress the incident I 2
in the halide precursor solution by employing alkaline, wherein iodine can be effectively eliminated via a disproportionation reaction under a number of different alkaline environments. The alkalinity is further demonstrated to affect the crystallization kinetics and optoelectronic properties of perovskite films. For instance, formamidine acetate as a ‘residual free’ weak alkaline, is found to effectively manipulate the stoichiometry of the cations in the mixed perovskite ((FA,MA,Cs)Pb(I,Br) 3 ) precursor, and in particular to reduce the density of deep-level defects in the resultant films substantially. Consequently, the corresponding mixed perovskite solar cells achieve an average PCE of 20.87% (certified). More interestingly, this modified absorber possesses a smaller bandgap, but the resultant device revealed unambiguous improvement in the open-circuit voltage ( V OC ), corresponding to a
V OC
deficit of 413 mV, which is one of the smallest certified value in the planar perovskite solar cells. These findings provide a universal approach for defect reduction in iodide-based perovskite films, which substantially reduce the energy and voltage loss to boost the efficiency of the devices. Results Suppression of I 2
impurity via alkaline additives Precise control of precursor solutions is crucial for perovskite film deposition. Generally, the organic precursors are hygroscopic and unstable in air or under illumination. In particular, formamidine iodide (FAI) and methylammonium iodide (MAI) can be easily oxidized to form I 2
and/or other by-products, which induces the nonstoichiometric ratio in the precursor solution. It further leads to defect states in perovskite films that eventually deteriorate device performance. The degradation mechanism involves the formation of I 2 , which is thoroughly studied in previous work 30 . Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy was conducted to semiquantitatively investigate the formation of iodide species in the precursor solution 27 , 28 , 29 , 31 . As shown in Fig.  1a , the organic cation solution used to prepare the perovskite films shows a characteristic peak at 360 nm. It is often attributed to the absorption of I 3 − , stemmed from I −
reacting reversibly with I 2 . Interestingly, the peak intensity equals to that of 10 −4
M I 2
in isopropanol, indicating the trace amount of I 2
in the organic cation precursor solution. Fig. 1 Suppression of I 2
impurity via alkaline additives. UV-vis absorption spectra of the organic cation solution, which is used to prepare the perovskite films, with different amounts of ( a ) FAAc, ( b ) CH 3 COONa, ( c ) NaHCO 3 , ( d ) NaOH, and ( e ) KOH ethanol solution.
f
Normalized absorbance for organic cation solution with different additives as a function of the volume Full size image To eliminate the incident I 2
in the precursor solution, we propose to create an alkaline environment by introducing additives in the precursor solution. A series of alkaline additives with different alkalinity were employed, such as formamidine acetate (FAAc, p K a
~7.64), sodium acetate (CH 3 COONa, p K a
~9.24), sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3 , p K a
~10.33), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, p K a
~14.56), and potassium hydroxide (KOH, p K a
~14.7), to create the full spectrum of alkalinity precursor environment in the context of the alkalinity (see Supplementary Notes  1
and
2
for details). Take the alkaline solution of FAAc/ethanol for example, we observed that along with an increasing amount of FAAc, the absorbance at 360 nm for precursor solution was dramatically reduced (Fig.  1a ). Similarly, reduced absorbance at 360 nm was also observed when FAAc was added to the iodine solution (10 −4
M, Supplementary Fig.  1 ). This indicates that the diminishing absorbance at 360 nm in the precursor solution is due to the reduction of incident I 2 . Furthermore, CH 3 COONa, NaHCO 3 , NaOH, and KOH took the same effects as expected when added to the precursor solution (Fig.  1b–e ). Meanwhile, the addition of pure ethanol does not reduce the absorption peak of I 3 −
(Supplementary Fig.  2 ). The disappearance of I 3 −
(mostly related to I 2 ) in the alkaline environment possibly suggests a disproportionation reaction in the precursor solution, wherein I 2
is converted into iodate and iodide 32
(see Supplementary Note  3 ). In addition (Fig.  1f ), we found that the alkalinity of additives would largely influence the disproportionation reaction. It requires less amount of NaOH or KOH to eliminate the I 2
peak of precursor solution than that of FAAc, CH 3 COONa, or NaHCO 3 , mostly because the former ones are ‘strong’ alkaline in the context of conventional inorganic chemistry. Morphology, phase, and carrier lifetime analysis The typical two-step approach was employed to fabricate the perovskite films (see details in the Methods section). We named the two-step processed reference perovskite film ((FA,MA,Cs)Pb(I,Br) 3 ) as the PVSK film. To ascertain the impact of alkaline additives on the morphology and crystallographic structure of the resultant films, we performed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements accordingly. Compared with the PVSK film, the perovskite films with CH 3 COONa or FAAc additive exhibited enlarged grain size (Fig.  2a–c ), while those with NaOH or KOH remain the same grain size (Fig.  2d , Supplementary Fig.  3 ). It possibly indicates the different crystallization kinetics during film growth induced by the alkaline additives. Upon the employment of CH 3 COONa or FAAc, volatile acetate ions are reported to facilitate grain growth for better film quality 33 , which might account for the relatively enlarged grain size. On the contrary, perovskite films with the introduction of NaOH or KOH showed similar grain size, but a distinct crystalline grain morphology, as compared with the reference. It is often ascribed to the fact that Na +
or K +
is too small to incorporate into the perovskite lattice according to the Goldschmidt tolerance factor 34 . However, we cannot fully rule out the influences for crystal growth in the kinetics perspective, given the different chemical environments introduced by different alkalines, which will be discussed later.

Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra for the perovskite films deposited on glass prepared from the precursor solution with different alkaline additives Full size image Furthermore, XRD results showed a dominating α-phase perovskite in all films (Fig.  2e ), indicating that all these additives do not impact the thermodynamics of crystal growth substantially. However, PbI 2
conversion process was affected by additives, as inferred from the formation of δ-phase perovskite, as well as the residual PbI 2 . We purposely controlled the stoichiometry in all samples with a bit excessive of PbI 2
for efficient passivation 35 , 36
(see also Supplementary Note  4 ). We observed that perovskite films with mild alkaline additives (CH 3 COONa or NaHCO 3 ) only exhibited a relatively stronger PbI 2
peak, while a distinct δ-phase perovskite peak occurred when strong alkaline additives (NaOH or KOH) were added during film fabrication. It suggests that the alkalinity of the additives would affect the formation of the by-products, where the stronger alkaline would promote the formation of the δ-phase and suppress the formation of the α-phase perovskite as well. To confirm our speculation, MA (p K a  = 10.62)/ethanol was introduced into the precursor solution (Fig.  2f ). We found a considerable amount of δ-phase perovskite in the resultant perovskite film. As predicted, the formation of the α-phase perovskite was suppressed substantially when the content of MA/ethanol was twice more. Interestingly, compared with the other additives, the weak alkaline FAAc resulted in the desirable phase quality, with significantly improved film crystallinity and less PbI 2
content, as compared with that of the reference and other additives. The intrinsic defects in perovskite films affect the photogenerated carrier behavior and device performance, which also would be affected by the alkalinity of the additives. We therefore conducted time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) analysis to study the dynamics of carrier recombination. The perovskite films were deposited on glass by using a precursor solution with different alkaline additives. The TRPL decay curves (Fig.  2g ) were fitted with the bi-exponential rate law (Supplementary Table  1 ). We found that the perovskite films with addition of a weak alkaline possessed a longer carrier lifetime than those with the addition of a strong alkaline. The prolonged lifetime of perovskite films with a weak alkaline additive, compared with that of the PVSK film, was attributed to the suppression of incident I 2
in precursor solution and the desired film features, e.g., morphology and phase. Among all samples with alkaline additives, the perovskite film with FAAc exhibited the longest lifetime for both fast and slow recombination ( τ 1  = 132.7 ns and
τ 2  = 802.2 ns), indicating its lowest non-radiative recombination centers. To be noted, the introduction of Na +
or K +
also could possibly deform the perovskite crystal structure, which may lead to shallow defect sites or off-bandgap defects in perovskite films 37 , 38 , 39 , 40
(see Supplementary Note  5 ). Crystallization kinetics control via alkalinity We further investigate the underlying crystallization kinetics of the formation of the α-phase perovskite by developing an in situ UV-vis absorption measurement. In a typical experiment, the organic cation solution was spin-coated onto the annealed PbI 2
layer, which was further characterized by a UV-vis absorption spectrometer immediately. By varying the alkalinity in precursor solution (Fig.  3a ), we clearly observed that the formation of the α-phase perovskite, whose main absorption peak ranged from 450 to 800 nm, was suppressed substantially when the alkalinity gets stronger. To be noted, the absorption before 450 nm might stem from the PbI 2
or the δ-phase perovskite. Moreover, we judiciously selected two typical alkaline additives, e.g., FAAc (weak alkaline) and NaOH (strong alkaline), and continuously tracked the conversion evolution from PbI 2
to the α-phase perovskite. Compared with the reference (Fig.  3b ), the weak alkaline does not affect the formation of the α-phase perovskite, as expected. Accordingly, the absorption peak of the α-phase perovskite in the main range (450–800 nm) is increased continuously as time grows. The inset figure in Fig.  3b
provides a visualization of the improved absorption in the range of 450 and 800 nm, suggesting the continuous formation of the α-phase perovskite. On the contrary (Fig.  3c ), the formation of the α-phase perovskite with a strong alkaline was suppressed substantially. Even over time, only small changes occurred, as visualized in the inset figure of Fig.  3c . Based on the above analysis, we confirmed that the crystallization kinetics of the transformation from PbI 2
to the α-phase perovskite, namely the activation energy, was influenced by the alkalinity of additives. As shown in scheme (Fig.  3d ), when the alkalinity in the precursor gets stronger, the activation energy becomes larger, leading to an increased barrier for the transformation from the PbI 2
to the α-phase perovskite. The results suggest that while incident I 2
could be effectively eliminated via a disproportionation reaction under various alkaline environments, the alkalinity of the additives is also crucial to fabricate high-quality perovskite films with a desired phase. Because of the enrichment of the OH −
anion when alkalinity gets stronger, we speculate that the oxygen in the OH −
anion could participate in the coordination with lead iodide with stronger bonding. This may facilitate the structural transformation from PbI 2
to the δ-phase perovskite, leading to an increased energy barrier for the transformation of PbI 2
to the α-phase perovskite. Fig. 3 Crystallization kinetics control of perovskite films.

e
Activation energies of the α- and δ-phase of FAPbI 3
in the dependence of OH −
concentration Full size image To verify the argument, we further performed the DFT simulation to analyze the exact activation energy for the formation of both the α-phase and δ-phase of the FAPbI 3
perovskite in different conditions. The Calculation setup was given in Methods and Supplementary Note  6 . As shown in Fig.  3e , two converse trends of the activation energy change are observed upon the introduction of OH −
into synthesis. At the low OH −
concentration, the δ-phase FAPbI 3
has shown a much higher activation energy of 5.352 eV, which is 1.834 eV higher than that of the α-phase. As the OH −
concentration increases, the activation energies of δ-phase FAPbI 3
decline from 5.352 to 4.143 eV. However, the activation energies of α-phase FAPbI 3
increase from 3.518 to 4.293 eV, and finally exceed that of δ-phase FAPbI 3 . It clearly suggests that the formation of the α-phase perovskite is only preferred at a low OH −
concentration. With the increase of OH −
concentration, δ-phase FAPbI 3
is more preferred kinetically, which is in consistent with the observation of the experiments above. Weak alkaline additives to reduce defect state density To generalize the above findings, we selected three alkalines with a weak alkalinity, such as FAAc, triethanolamine hydrochloride (TEAHCl, p K a
~7.8), and sodium hypophosphite (NaH 2 PO 2 , p K a
~7.4), and incorporated them into different perovskite material systems, respectively. We conducted the TRPL measurement to characterize the carrier recombination profile of different perovskite films. The corresponding devices are subject to photovoltaic performance investigations (see Supplementary Note  7 ). The results demonstrate that the additives with a weak alkalinity could successfully decrease the trap state density of iodine-based perovskite films via effectively inhibiting incident I 2
in the precursor solution. Combining the influence for alkalinity on the crystallization kinetics of perovskite films, the resultant devices show improved photovoltaic efficiency. To obtain an in-depth understanding of the influence of a weak alkaline on the defect state of the perovskite, we chose the FAAc as an example and named the corresponding two-step processed perovskite film ((FA,MA,Cs)Pb(I,Br) 3 –FAAc) as the PVSK–FA. At first, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of PVSK and PVSK–FA over a temperature from 78 to 350 K were obtained and investigated (Fig.  4a, b ). Within the temperature range of interest, the emission peak of PVSK–FA exhibited a distinct red shift as compared with PVSK, which was consistent with the UV-vis absorption results (Supplementary Fig.  4 ). It indicates a higher ratio of FA +
incorporated into the PVSK–FA due to the addition of an additive in the precursor. It was documented that the MAPbI 3
film exhibited a broadening inhomogeneous multi-peak emission feature from a low-temperature phase, partially attributed to additional charge or exciton trap states only activated in low temperature 41 . However, in Figure  4a, b , we did not observe the above-mentioned multi-peak feature at a low temperature in the PVSK and PVSK–FA, indicating the characteristics of less traps. With temperature increasing, we observed a broadening of the emission line due to the electron–phonon coupling near room temperature, which was a consistent recent study in the FAPbI 3
film 42 . Interestingly, the PL spectra of the PVSK–FA exhibited a better symmetry than the PVSK with temperature increasing from 250 to 350 K (Fig.  4c ). On the one hand, the absence of an asymmetric feature in this film may suggest significant reduction of defect states near the band edge. It is believed that reduced grain boundaries may lead to reduced defects 43 , which is consistent with the morphology analysis of larger grains in the corresponding films (Fig.  2a, b ). On the other hand, better symmetry in the PL peak indicates the absence of shoulder peaks often attributed to the slight phase segregation in the mixed perovskites 37 . It is thus implied that PVSK–FA possibly exhibited a retarded phase segregation and decreased defect states, when compared with the PVSK.

h
Trap density of states (tDOS) for both devices obtained by thermal admittance spectroscopy at room temperature Full size image We further carefully examined the luminescence efficiency of the absorber, which serves as an important measure to identify a high-quality semiconductor 44 , 45 , 46 . Generally, deep-level defects serve as non-radiative recombination centers to capture the photogenerated charge carriers, thereby dramatically cutting down the quantum efficiency of photoluminescence and photovoltaic efficiency in solar cells. To be noted, a good solar cell has to be a good light-emitting diode 44 . According to Shockley–Queisser equation, the
V OC
of the device decreases when the luminescence quantum efficiency of the absorber decreases. Here, the PL quantum efficiency (PLQE) of the perovskite film was examined as a function of excitation power (Fig.  4d ). The PLQE was relatively small for either PVSK or PVSK–FA at low excitation power, but rapidly went up with the increase of excitation power. It indicates that the radiative recombination prevails at high optical injection levels, wherein non-radiative recombination centers were filled up, which have been further discussed in Supplementary Note  8 . Notably, the PLQE of PVSK–FA achieved 61% when the excitation power was 100 mW cm –2
(close to the device working condition), which is more than twice as that of PVSK (PLQE = 25%). It further revealed obvious enhancement of PLQE compared with PVSK among the entire excitation power range, confirming the reduction of deep-level defect state in PVSK–FA. It correlates to the improvement in
V OC
in the corresponding device, as will be discussed later. To find the defect energy level in the perovskite films, we conducted thermal admittance spectroscopy (TAS) analysis. It is widely adopted in perovskite solar cells to extract the native defect state-level information through the identification of junction capacitance. Given a p-type perovskite semiconductor, the defect activation energy ( E a ) is approximately the depth of defect state energy level relative to the valance band of the perovskite 47 , 48 . Here, TAS measurement was carried out from 250 to 350 K with a step of 10 K to obtain the temperature-dependent admittance spectra for PVSK and PVSK–FA-based devices (Fig.  4e, f ). The characteristic transition angular frequency ( ω 0 ) was extracted from the derivative of the capacitance–frequency spectrum. The relationship between
E a
and
ω 0
follows the equation:
ω 0  =  βT 2
exp(− E a / kT ), where
β
is a temperature-dependent parameter,
k
is the Boltzmann’s constant, and
T
is the temperature. The Arrhenius plot (Fig.  4g ) derived from the temperature-dependent
ω 0
and fitted curves revealed that the
E a
of PVSK and PVSK–FA devices were 0.282 and 0.238 eV, respectively. Moreover, we attempted to illustrate the energetic profile regarding the trap density of states (tDOS) in the perovskite absorber (Fig.  4h ). It could be derived from the equation
N T ( E ω ) = −
ωV bi / qkTW   ×  d C /d ω
and
E ω  =  kT
ln( βT 2 / ω ), where
q
is the elementary charge,
ω
is the angular frequency,
V bi
is the built-in potential, and
W
is the depletion region, respectively 49 . The
V bi
and
W
were obtained from the Mott–Schottky analysis (Supplementary Fig.  5 ). As expected, the PVSK device exhibited a relatively large density of defect states, especially around the deep defect level at 0.282 eV. Previous DFT calculation study 26
reported that this defect-state level (0.282 eV) could potentially be ascribed to iodine interstitials (I i ), which was the deep-level defect state and dominating non-radiative recombination centers in devices. Interestingly, the PVSK–FA device exhibited a striking reduction of the deep-level defect state at 0.282 eV for two orders of magnitude. In addition, the shallow defect states (0.1–0.2 eV) were also suppressed. Considering the analysis above, we reasonably claim that the introduction of a weak alkaline additive could effectively suppress the incident I 2
in the precursor solution and significantly reduce the I i
defect states and achieve a much smaller defect activation energy in the resultant perovskite films. In this case, our iodine suppression approach looks contradictory with the previous research 29 ;
however, we argue that the discrepancy in these two approaches of iodine management is mostly due to different physiochemical properties in the corresponding absorber layers. It likely stemmed from the two film growth techniques applied and different material compositions, which is further discussed in Supplementary Note  9 . Beside of defects at the deep energy level, tail defects at the band edge were further investigated. Urbach tail profiles of perovskite films were calculated according to the formula equation:
α  = α 0
exp( hv / E U ), where α 0
is a constant,
E U
denotes Urbach energy, and
α
is an absorption coefficient. The absorption coefficient versus energy plots were presented in Supplementary Fig.  6 . As is reported 33 , 50 , low
E U
is highly desirable for semiconductor devices, indicative of less electronic disorders in the crystal lattice (or less impurities). Accordingly, the
E U
values were estimated to be 31.22 and 29.64 meV for PVSK and PVSK–FA, respectively. Assuming the same level of thermal disorder, the smaller
E U
value obtained from PVSK–FA demonstrated a lower level of electronic disorder at the band edge. To quantitatively assess the concentration of defects across the entire device, the current density–voltage curves under the dark state for capacitor-like devices with indium tin oxide (ITO)/perovskite/gold (Au) configuration were measured (Supplementary Fig.  7 ). The linear current density–voltage relation at the low bias suggested an ohmic response, and the transition point was considered as the voltage at which all the traps were filled (trap-filled limit voltage:
V TFL ). The concentration of defects was determined by the equation
N defects  = 2 εε 0 V TFL / qL 2 , where
q
is the elementary charge,
ε
is the relative dielectric constant,
ε 0
is the vacuum permittivity, and
L
is the thickness of the perovskite films obtained from the cross-sectional SEM images of the ITO/perovskite/Au devices (Supplementary Fig.  8 ). It is reasonable to assume that the slight introduction of an additive would not affect the relative dielectric constants of perovskite films significantly 51 . The defect density
N defects
was estimated to be 1.38 × 10 16
and 0.47 × 10 16  cm −3
for PVSK and PVSK–FA devices, respectively. It clearly confirms that the defect density in the perovskite absorber has been significantly reduced to nearly an order of magnitude by the addition of a weak alkaline additive. Moreover, we have conducted femtosecond optical measurements 52
and confirmed that PVSK–FA exhibited a lower defect density than the PVSK film, which is the same order of magnitude as the above result (Supplementary Note  10 ). Weak alkaline additive to improve photovoltaic performance The significant reduction in intrinsic defect density within the perovskite film was expected to suppress the non-radiative recombination channel effectively and improve the device performance. To prove it, we fabricated the planar heterojunction devices using the structure ITO/SnO 2 /perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au (Supplementary Fig.  9 ) and studied the impacts of weak alkaline additives on photovoltaic performance. Figure  5a
presents the current density–voltage ( J – V ) curves of the optimized perovskite devices measured under standard AM 1.5 G at ambient condition. The typical PVSK device yielded a PCE of 19.97% with a
V OC
of 1.102 V, a short-circuit current density ( J SC ) of 23.83 mA cm –2 , and a fill factor (FF) of 76.05%. Meanwhile, the best PVSK–FA device exhibited a significantly improved performance with a
V OC
of 1.145 V, a
J SC
of 24.05 mA cm –2 , a FF of 76.31%, and the corresponding PCE of 21.01%. One of our best devices was sent to the accredited PV calibration laboratory (Newport, USA) and the certified PCE was 20.87% (Supplementary Fig.  10 ). The slightly enhanced
J SC
value was attributed to improved light-harvesting capacity and a slightly red shift of the absorption onset. The major improvement in device performance was contributed from
V OC
enhancement, thanks to the high-quality perovskite thin film with significantly reduced intrinsic defect density by the addition of a weak alkaline additive. Fig. 5 Photovoltaic device performance.

V OC
as a function of light intensity for the PVSK and PVSK–FA devices Full size image To be emphasized, in the present study, the addition of FAAc could slightly reduce the bandgap of the resultant film from 1.57 eV to 1.56 eV but increase
V OC
from 1.102 to 1.147 V in the resulting device. It is interesting that although the bandgap of the perovskite film decreased, the
V OC
of the relevant solar devices actually improved (Fig.  5b ). It thus reveals one vital feature for this high-efficiency device, which is the small
V OC
deficit (defined as
E g / q
− V OC , where
E g
is the optical bandgap and
q
is the elemental charge).
V OC
deficit is an essential indicator to measure the potential of the photovoltaic material and the maturity of the relevant technology. Current
V OC
deficit for c-silicon, GaAs, and organic solar cells are around 400, 300, and 600 mV, respectively 53 . Surprisingly, the corresponding
V OC
deficit in our device decreased to 413 mV upon FAAc addition, wherein both the
V OC
(1.147 V) and the bandgap (1.56 eV) were certified through a third party. The
V OC
deficit of 413 mV is one of the smallest certified value for planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells to date. It further implies substantially reduced non-radiative recombination losses in the PVSK–FA device, which was consistent with the high PLQE measured previously. In addition, we did not observe an appreciable
J – V
hysteresis in the corresponding device, and the average PCE of 20.91% was achieved (Fig.  5c
and Supplementary Fig.  10 ). The integrated photocurrent density gave a calculated value of 23.47 mA cm −2
from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum (Supplementary Fig.  11 ), which was comparable with the result from
J – V
measurement. In addition, a steady-state current density of 21.89 mA cm −2
and a stabilized PCE of 20.80%, were also achieved by holding the voltage at the maximum power point (0.95 V) for the PVSK–FA device (Fig.  5d ). To probe the reliability and repeatability, 20 individual devices were fabricated with the identical processing condition and the corresponding statistical distribution of the PCE values was presented (Supplementary Fig.  12 ). The average efficiency for the PVSK and PVSK–FA devices were 19.34% and 20.63%, respectively. Furthermore, we have investigated the long-term stability of the PVSK and PVSK–FA-based devices, as shown in Supplementary Fig.  13 . The reference without further encapsulation degraded to be around 80% within 1500 h of storage in an N 2
glove box, whereas the PVSK–FA-based devices exhibited less degradation. It is possibly because of the higher thin-film quality of PVSK–FA with reduced defect states, which inhibits the penetration of undesirable water or oxygen molecules that further decompose perovskite films. Meanwhile, it may also correlate to the elimination of incident I 2 , which has been demonstrated to induce the chemical chain degradation of the perovskite 31 . To gain further insights into the carrier dynamics across the device, we measured transient photocurrent (TPC) and photovoltage (TPV) decays of PVSK and PVSK–FA-based devices on the microsecond scale 54 . The PVSK–FA-based device exhibited a faster decay than that of the PVSK-based device, and the charge transport lifetime ( τ t ) derived from TPC measurements (Supplementary Fig.  14 ) was decreased from 4.13 to 1.97 μs, indicating a dramatic improvement of charge transport capability for the PVSK–FA-based device. The TPV curves were correlated to the carrier recombination rates under the open-circuit condition in the full cell. We observed that the PVSK–FA-based device demonstrated a much slower decay, when compared with that of the PVSK-based device (Fig.  5e ). The charge recombination lifetime ( τ r ) derived from the TPV curves was significantly prolonged from 12.40 to 19.37 μs, suggesting that the carrier recombination was predominately prohibited in the device. It indicates that the prolonged lifetime constant
τ r
contributed from substantially reduced defect density in the perovskite material by the addition of weak alkaline additives. Furthermore, we measured the
V OC
change as a function of illumination intensity to elucidate the carrier recombination mechanism during device operation. For both PVSK and PVSK–FA-based devices, the
V OC
increased monotonically with incident light intensity (Fig.  5f ). According to the equation
V OC  =  nkT / q
ln( I SC / I 0  + 1), the values of the ideality factor were calculated to be 1.51 and 1.02, respectively. Generally, the ideality factor derails from unity if Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination occurs 55 . In our study, the ideality factor for the PVSK–FA-based device showed a significant reduction from 1.51 to 1.02, when compared with that of the PVSK-based device. It demonstrates that trap-assisted SRH recombination was suppressed substantially due to the reduced intrinsic defect density, which was in good agreement with previous results. Discussion In summary, we demonstrate a universal pathway to effectively suppress the incident I 2
defects and manipulate the stoichiometry via the iodine disproportionation reaction under an alkaline environment. The alkalinity is proven to be a crucial parameter that greatly impacts the crystallization kinetics and optoelectronic properties of the perovskite films. A weak alkaline consisting of the FA +
cation was demonstrated to serve as a ‘residual’ free agent to suppress deep-level defect density in the mixed perovskites ((FA,MA,Cs)Pb(I,Br) 3 ), which provides extra benefits in tuning the A-site stoichiometry and film morphology. Featured with a narrower bandgap of the absorber though, the device exhibited a significant enhancement on
V OC . It observed one of the smallest
V OC
deficits of 413 mV in a certified planar heterojunction perovskite solar cell with an average PCE of 20.87%. These findings would bridge the gap between precursor chemistry and deep-level defect behavior in the perovskite film, particularly the iodide-based perovskite, which guides the design of next-generation perovskite solar cells with an efficiency approaching the theoretical limit. Methods Materials All the reagents and chemicals were used as received, including PbI 2

All the formamidinium iodide (FAI), methylammonium iodide (MAI), methylammonium bromine (MABr), and methylammonium chloride (MACl) were synthesized and purified according to the procedure mentioned in the pervious literature 54 . Preparation of the SnO 2
films The tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) substrates were cleaned with acetone, deionized water, and isopropanol ultrasonically. The tin (IV) oxide colloidal dispersion (SnO 2 , 15% in H 2 O colloidal dispersion) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. The precursor solution was diluted by H 2 O to 2.67% and then spin-coated onto glass/ITO substrates at 4000 rpm for 30 s, and finally baked on a hot plate at 150 °C for 30 min in ambient air. Preparation of the perovskite precursor and films To prepare the PbI 2
and organic cation precursors, 600 mg of PbI 2
and 18 mg of CsI were dissolved in 1 mL of mixture solvent of DMF:DMSO (9:1 v:v) and then annealed on a hot plate at 70 °C for 2 h with vigorous stirring. In all, 40 mg of FAI, 19 mg of MAI, 6 mg of MABr, and 5 mg of MACl were dissolved in 1 mL of isopropanol and then continuously stirred for 2 h at room temperature. To prepare the alkaline additive solution, 45 mg of different additives were dissolved in 1 mL of anhydrous ethyl alcohol at 70 °C for 30 min with vigorous stirring. Due to the different solubility of alkaline additives in ethyl alcohol, the possible supernatant was separated (Supplementary Note  11 ). For the certified perovskite solar cell, 45 mg of FAAc were dissolved in 1 mL of ethyl alcohol at 70 °C for 30 min with vigorous stirring. Then, 30 μL of FAAc ethanol solution was added to 1 mL of organic cation solution before being prepared with the perovskite film. The typical sequent-step method was employed to fabricate the perovskite film. First, the PbI 2
precursor was spin-coated on the SnO 2
substrate in an N 2
glove box at 2300 rpm for 30 s (accelerated speed 6000 rpm s –1 ) and then annealed at 70 °C for 1 min in an N 2
glove box. Then, the organic cation precursor was spin-coated on the PbI 2
film at 2000 rpm for 30 s (accelerated speed 6000 rpm s –1 ) in an N 2
glove box. Finally, the film was kept under vacuum for 5 min and annealed at 150 °C for 15 min in ambient air to form the perovskite film. Preparation of the Spiro-OMeTAD films and gold electrode The Spiro-OMeTAD solution was first prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg of Spiro-OMeTAD, 17.5 μL of a stock solution of 520 mg mL −1
LiTFSI/acetonitrile, and 28.8 μL of tBP in 1 mL of chlorobenzene. Then the Spiro-OMeTAD precursor was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s (accelerated speed 6000 rpm s –1 ) in an N 2
glove box. Finally, 100 -nm-thick gold was thermally evaporated as a counterelectrode under a pressure of 1 × 10 −4
Pa on top of the Spiro-OMeTAD films to form the back contact by using a shadow mask to pattern the electrode. Calculation setup The calculations have been applied through DFT within CASTEP packages 56 . For the functional, the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof-based generalized gradient approximation (GGA) 57
has been selected to describe the electronic exchange–correlation interaction. All the geometry optimizations have been operated based on the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shannon (BFGS) algorithm, in which the residue of the Hellmann–Feynman forces will be converged to less than 0.001 eV A –1 . The additional convergence criteria for the total energy and the interionic displacement are set to be less than 5 × 10 −5
eV per atom and 0.005 Å per atom, respectively. The ultrafine plane-wave cutoff energy with the ultrasoft pseudopotential scheme has been chosen as the basis set. The OH −
molecule has been inserted into the PbI 2
model and FAPbI 3
unit cells with a different ratio n ( n  = 0.1–0.5) to represent the different concentration, which can be referred to as ‘#/unit cell’ in this simulation. The corresponding effect to the activation energies will be calculated based on the following equation: $$E_{{\mathrm{act}}} = E_{{\mathrm{FAPbI}}_{{\mathrm{3}}\left( {{\mathrm{OH}}} \right){\mathrm{n}}}} - E_{{\mathrm{PbI}}_{{\mathrm{2}}\left( {{\mathrm{OH}}} \right){\mathrm{n}}}}-E_{{\mathrm{FAI}}}$$

The Monkhost–Pack reciprocal space integration was performed using a spacing of 0.07 Å −1
in all models with a different OH −
concentration 58 , which was also self-consistently suggested by total energy minimization. With this special k-point sampling, the total energy is converged within the maximum expected self-consistent cycles. Characterization The absorbance of different precursor solutions and perovskite films was measured by a Hitachi UH4150 spectrophotometer. The integrating sphere was employed when we characterized the perovskite film. A field-emission SEM instrument (Hitachi S-4800) was used to acquire SEM images. The electron beam was accelerated at 5.0 kV. Temperature-dependent steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained by FLS980 (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd.), equipped with a Xe lamp, a liquid nitrogen cryostat (Oxford Instruments, OptistatDN-V), and a photomultiplier tube (PMT) detector. The excitation wavelength was 470 nm. The picosecond pulsed diode laser (EPL-470, Edinburgh Instruments Ltd.) was used to measure PL lifetime with a repetition rate of 0.2 MHz, a pulse width of 91.5 ps, a excitation fluence of
∼ 30 nJ cm –2 , and maximum average power of 5 mW. The PLQE data were obtained from a three-step technique through the combination of a 445-nm continuous-wave laser, a spectrometer, an optical fiber, and an integrating sphere 59 , 60 . The powder XRD spectra ( θ −2 θ
scans) were taken on a X’Pert3 powder X-ray diffraction system (PANalytical Inc.) with Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å) as the X-ray source. The thermal admittance spectroscopy were conducted on Zahner Zennium pro Electrochemical Workstation at various temperatures ( T  = 250–350 K) in the dark from 10 0
to 10 6  Hz. A small AC voltage of 50 mV was used, and the DC bias was kept at zero to avoid the influence of the ferroelectric effect for perovskite materials during measurement. For temperature-dependent characterization, the sample was mounted in the Cryo Industries Liquid Nitrogen Dewars with Lake Shore model 335 cryogenic temperature controller. The current density–voltage ( J–V ) curves were measured (2400 Series SourceMeter, Keithley Instruments) under a simulated AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm −2
(Newport Thermal Oriel 91192 1000-W solar simulator). The light intensity was calibrated using a KG-5 Si diode. The
J–V
measurements were carried out in ambient air. The sweep speed was fixed at 40 mV s –1
(step 0.02 V, delay time 500 ms). The shading mask and one of our best device were sent to an accredited PV calibration laboratory (Newport, USA) for certification. The active area was defined as 0.09408 cm 2 . External quantum efficiencies (EQE) were obtained by an Enli Technology (Taiwan) EQE measurement system. A calibrated silicon diode with the known spectral response was used as a reference. For the transient photovoltage or photocurrent (TPV or TPC) decay measurements, a white light bias was from an array of diodes (Molex 180081–4320) to simulate 1-sun working condition, and the carriers were excited by a 532-nm pulse laser. The dynamics curves were recorded on a digital oscilloscope at a mega Ω (open-circuit condition for TPV) and a 50-Ω (short-circuit condition for TPC) resistor.

Abstract The mixed halide perovskites have emerged as outstanding light absorbers for efficient solar cells. Unfortunately, it reveals inhomogeneity in these polycrystalline films due to composition separation, which leads to local lattice mismatches and emergent residual strains consequently. Thus far, the understanding of these residual strains and their effects on photovoltaic device performance is absent. Herein we study the evolution of residual strain over the films by depth-dependent grazing incident X-ray diffraction measurements. We identify the gradient distribution of in-plane strain component perpendicular to the substrate. Moreover, we reveal its impacts on the carrier dynamics over corresponding solar cells, which is stemmed from the strain induced energy bands bending of the perovskite absorber as indicated by first-principles calculations. Eventually, we modulate the status of residual strains in a controllable manner, which leads to enhanced PCEs up to 20.7% (certified) in devices via rational strain engineering.

Introduction Over the past decade, hybrid organic−inorganic halide perovskites have received enormous interest as low-cost and highly efficient light absorbers in photovoltaics 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 . The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells has shortly surpassed 22% in the lab scale 7 , and that of larger-area (>1 cm 2 ) devices has exceeded 20% 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 . The highest PCEs are mostly achieved by employing the mixed halide perovskites (e.g., (HC(NH 2 ) 2 PbI 3 ) 0.85 (CH 3 NH 3 PbBr 3 ) 0.15
i.e., (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15 ). Through element substitution, it provides a largely unexplored compositional space to tailor the physiochemical properties of corresponding materials for efficient and stable devices 1 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 . However, the mixed hybrid perovskites potentially suffer from materials inhomogeneity partially due to composition separation 16 , 17
and/or thermal stress. This may be originated from substantial chemical mismatch among each component, and the nonequilibrium growth conditions during film fabrication. On one hand, serious material inhomogeneity is regarded as phase separation, deviating from the originally desired materials properties to deteriorate the resultant device performance (both efficiency and operational stability) 18 , 19 . On the other hand, moderate material inhomogeneity correlates to local lattice mismatches and emergent residual strains in perovskite films. It deserves more attention, because such residual strains should result in lattice distortion of microscopic crystal structure, and further affect optoelectronic properties of the perovskite thin film 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 . Recently, the residual strains have been identified in the single-composition MAPbI 3
polycrystalline films, and were found to influence stability of perovskite films under illumination 22 . In an even wider spectrum of semiconductors, strain has been extensively investigated, and accordingly, strain engineering has been exploited to tailor the optoelectronic functionalities. For instance, the application of tensile strain was found to improve light emission in Germanium crystals and drive indirect-to-direct optical transition in bilayered two-dimensional WSe 2 26 , 27 , 28 . Strain compensation strategy has been demonstrated to improve efficiencies of GaAs-based quantum dot solar cells 29 , 30 . Strain-engineered MoS 2
monolayer was also proposed to have broad-range capture of solar energy 26 . For hybrid halide perovskites, especially mixed perovskites, in-depth understanding of their characteristics and effects on the material’s optoelectronic properties, is still absent. This precludes effective employment of strain engineering to further enhance the device performance. In this report, we probe the residual strain distribution profiles in the mixed perovskite thin films and its effects on photovoltaic device efficiency. We investigate the evolution of in-plane residual strain over the film thickness in the typical mixed perovskite (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15
by using grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurement. We identify a gradient distribution of in-plane strain component that correlates to the composition inhomogeneity perpendicular to the substrate. We further demonstrate a feasible method to modulate the tensile or compressive nature of residual strain and even its gradient over perovskite films in a controllable manner. With the aid of first-principles calculations, we find that the strain gradient induces energy bands bending and thus affects the carrier dynamics across the interfaces over the solar cell. By deliberately engineering the residual strains to enhance carrier extraction efficiency, we successfully fabricate strain-engineered perovskite solar cells to achieve enhanced PCEs up to 20.7% (certified). Results Probing residual strain gradient of mixed perovskite films In the direction parallel to substrates, the grain-to-grain inhomogeneity in polycrystalline films was already observed by adopting photoluminescence in a scanning electron microscopy (PL-SEM) and conductive-atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) 31 . However, it lacks depth profile along the film thickness regarding the lattice structure inhomogeneity. At the macroscopic level, the vertical homogeneity of thin films can be quantitatively evaluated by residual strain to reflect the lattice mismatch 20 , 22 , 32 . The macroscopic residual strain is an internal strain in polycrystalline materials that is balanced over a wide range of grains. We explored the residual strain distribution for mixed perovskite films vertically with the depth-dependent GIXRD measurement, wherein the classical sin 2 φ
measurement is combined with grazing incident X-ray diffraction to probe the in-plane residual strain. This method has been used in thin films of ZrO 2
and TiN, which provides reliable depth resolution to reveal lattice structure evolution 33 , 34 , 35 . As depicted in Fig.  1a , we fixed the 2 θ
and varied the instrument tilt angle
ψ
to obtain corresponding X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns as shown in Fig.  1b . For detailed test information, please see the  Supplementary method , Supplementary Fig.  1
and Supplementary Table  1 . The mixed perovskite films on the SnO 2 /ITO/glass substrates showed XRD peaks (2 θ ) at around 14.0°, 31.6°, and 40.5°, corresponding to (001), (012), and (022) crystallographic planes, respectively 36 . Among all three planes with intensive diffraction peaks, the (012) plane was chosen for further analysis due to its high diffraction angle and multiplicative factor, which provides the most reliable structure symmetry information.

perovskite film with tensile strain. XRD X-ray diffraction, TEM transmission electron microscopy Full size image We picked up three representative depths of 50, 200 and 500 nm to check the residual strain in the mixed perovskite films with the nominal formula of (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15 . At each fixed depth, diffraction data were fitted with Gaussian distribution function and it clearly observed a systematic shift in peak position to lower 2 θ
when the penetrated depth increased (Fig.  1b
and Supplementary Fig.  2 ). Generally, sin 2 φ
and 2 θ
follow a linear relationship and the slope of the fitting line stands for the magnitude of the residual strain (see equation (1) in  Supplementary method ). As shown in Fig.  1b , all fitting lines exhibited negative value in the slopes, which means (012) crystal planes exhibit enlarged distance when turning to the out-of-plane direction at the same detected depth. It thus indicates the entire sample is subjected to tensile strain. It is in agreement with previous study wherein the residual tensile strain was observed in perovskite thin films upon the similar annealing process 22 . With the increase of probe depth, the fitting lines show smaller slopes in absolute value, which implies the macroscopic residual tensile strain gradually decreases. Moreover, we found the most significant deviation in lattice constant at 50 nm as compared to that of 200 and 500 nm. Besides, the (001) and (022) crystal planes were also found to follow the similar trend (Supplementary Fig.  2 ). It indicates the residual strain inhomogeneity in the mixed perovskite thin film, wherein the top surface of the film bears the largest tensile strain. It is worth noting that residual strain correlates to the lattice distortion, which might affect the carrier dynamics at the relevant interfaces, as will be discussed later. Therefore, the residual tensile strain gradient was clearly identified, which gradually decreases from the top surface to the core in the mixed perovskite polycrystalline thin films. So far, we have observed the gradient distribution of tensile strain in the perovskite thin film. And it will be interesting to understand the origin of the residual strain. The residual stain is often stemmed from the lattice mismatch due to lattice structure evolution. We thus conducted GIXRD measurements with variable grazing incident angle
ω
(Supplementary Table  1 ) to reveal the lattice mismatch along the film thickness. These depth-dependent XRD patterns were roughly similar and no new diffraction peaks appeared, indicating the film exhibited the same cubic phase structure at different depths. However, we observed a systematic shift of diffraction peaks along with the probing depths at 50, 200, and 500 nm in the perovskite film. Take (001) planes for example, the corresponding diffraction peaks for 50, 200, and 500 nm exhibited peak centers at 14.01°, 13.94°, and 13.90°, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 3). Among different crystal planes of (001), (012) and (022), corresponding peak positions gradually shift towards the low diffraction angle with the increase of probing depths. According to the Bragg’s law, larger lattice constant was expected in the deeper zone of films. Thus, the crystal structure inhomogeneity along the film thickness is detected unambiguously. To provide the evidence regarding the structure inhomogeneity in the microscopic level, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) nano-beam electron diffraction measurement was further carried out to investigate crystal structure evolution along the depth direction of mixed perovskite films. We obtained the high-resolution TEM image with micro-area diffraction patterns to inspect three typical regions with different depths (Fig.  1d–f ). After careful calibration of all measured diffraction patterns (Supplementary Table  2 ), we found that the crystal plane distance increased with scanning depth. As shown in Fig.  1e–g , lattice parameters of (004) planes were measured to be 1.60, 1.64 and 1.67 Å for three individual areas, respectively, which is consistent with the GIXRD results. Combining the microscopic analysis (TEM) and the long-range structure characterization (GIXRD), we clearly illustrate lattice structure evolution developed vertically in the mixed perovskite polycrystalline thin films, wherein the lattice constant decreases from the surface to the bottom. The above-mentioned crystal structure inhomogeneity is likely to correlate to the composition evolution in mixed perovskite thin films. It is commonly accepted that FAPbI 3
exhibits the cubic phase with the lattice constant of 6.357 Å 36 . When MA and/or Br element are incorporated to form the mixed perovskites single crystals, they hold the cubic phase with decreased lattice parameters. We observed smaller lattice constant at the surface of the film, which may partially attribute to higher ratio of MA and/or Br components in the long-range ordered FA based perovskite lattices. To identify the distribution of MA and/or Br components, we resorted to time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) depth profiles and TEM/EDX mapping for the (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15
perovskite film samples as shown in the inset of Fig.  1h , Supplementary Figs.  4
and   5 . It shows a homogeneous distribution of CsBr 2+ , CsI 2+ , FA +
in the all samples, which indicates the even distribution of the halogen Br − . It is reasonable because the smallest halogen ion Br −
can diffuse and be evenly distributed during the crystallization process. To be noted, the signal intensity of MA +
fragment decreased substantially from the surface to the core region in all mixed perovskite thin films, consistent with the XRD and TEM results. Unambiguously it reveals the gradient evolution of composition and thus lattice structure across the depth direction due to the gradient distribution of organic cation MA + . The non-uniform composition distribution indicates the unique kinetics for film growth, which is possibly related to the coordination strength of different precursors 37
and film processing conditions. It clearly implies the compositional distribution serve as one major factor that leads to the gradient residual strain. It is revealed that hybrid perovskites with different lattice structures often exhibit different optoelectronic properties 25 , 38
and it is expected to observe the gradient variation in terms of optoelectronic properties within the gradient phase structure of the film. Therefore, we examined the depth-dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectra within the film by using confocal fluorescence microscope. With the increasing depth of the beam probe, a systematic red shift of PL spectra was observed (Fig.  1h
and Supplementary Fig.  6 ). Fitting with the Gaussian distribution function, we found the PL peak positions shifted from 781 to 788 nm, and their full width at half maximum (FWHM) decreased along the film thickness. Since the emission photon energy is determined by the bandgap of semiconductors, it indicates the perovskite film exhibits gradually decreased bandgap from the surface to the bottom vertically. To be noted, it follows the similar trend in gradient evolution of lattice structure and compositional distribution, wherein more MA +
ions are incorporated in the perovskite crystals at the top surface of the film. In addition, narrower PL linewidth emission at the deeper region of perovskite film was observed, which may indicate weakened interaction between charge carriers and lattice vibrations (phonons) due to improved film homogeneity and lattice order 39 , 40 . Modulating the residual strains Based on the analysis above, we reveal that the observed residual strain gradient in perovskite films is closely related to lattice structure evolution due to detectable compositional inhomogeneity. However, it may not be the only contributor that governs the residual strain, given the largest tensile strain concentrated on the film surface. Interestingly, when examining the pure MAPbI 3
perovskite thin film, we still observed the existence of gradient residual strain (Supplementary Fig.  7 ). It is thus speculated that the thermal strain may take effects due to the temperature gradient during perovskite film fabrication. To illustrate, the perovskite film is roughly divided into two regions, e.g., the surface and the bottom (near the substrate). When heated on a hot plate, both regions experienced substantial temperature gradient (higher at the bottom). Consequently, the inorganic framework near the bottom expands more in volume upon annealing as compared to that at the surface, which facilitates the insertion of larger cation (FA + ) to form the perovskite crystalline structure. It possibly results in the inhomogeneous composition in the film, wherein MA +
prefers to stay at the surface. Upon cooling, it is reasonable that the surface cools down much faster than that of the core, which leads to less volume shrinkage. As a result, the surface withstands tensile strain and the core is subjected to compressive strain accordingly. Additionally, since the thermal expansion coefficient of perovskites is much larger than that of the substrate, the entire film bears the tensile strain during film cooling process. Thereby, the core experiences not only compressive strain from the surface, but also tensile strain from the substrate, which leads to the gradient residual tensile strain in the perovskite thin film. To verify the speculation, we attempted to modulate the gradient in-plane residual strain in the perovskite thin films by adjusting the annealing process. We first tried to anneal the film at 150 °C high temperature for a long time, which is a conventional approach to eliminating residual strains in metal alloy materials. Unfortunately, it led to the significant occurrence of PbI 2
(Supplementary Fig.  7 ) in the resultant thin films due to the relative poor thermal stability of hybrid perovskites 41 . We then tried to change the temperature gradient when the films were annealed. Simply, we modified the heat treatment process by flipping over the thin film sample to provide an invert temperature gradient. Interestingly, tensile strain was significantly reduced in the samples upon this treatment as shown in Fig.  2a, b . With small strain gradient and the closer lattice distance in the perovskite film, the lattice structure was almost homogeneous. It thus suggests an effective way to significantly reduce the tensile strain inhomogeneity across the film thickness by tuning the temperature gradient during film processing. Furthermore, we tried to directly perform flipped annealing process to the intermediate state film after the spin-coating process ends, which is expected to apply compressive strain with vertical gradient over the film. In contrast to the previous samples, the as-prepared films show the fitting curves possessed slopes in positive values (Fig.  2c, d ), which increased along with the probe depth. It clearly indicates films exhibit compressive strain, which is also distributed in a vertical gradient. Unfortunately, we observed a lot of pinholes in the resultant film possibly because the solvent cannot be spread smoothly during the annealing process (Supplementary Fig.  9 ). Therefore, we demonstrate the temperature gradient is also an important source to residual strain during the film growth, which further suggests a method to manipulate the evolution of lattice structure of polycrystalline thin films and the surface strain.

The schematic representation of the tensile strain state of the film in the top surface, showing the lattice structure with/without tensile strain on the film surface from the perspective of long-range order Full size image To investigate whether the upper contacting layer influences the surface strain, we prepared a tensile-strained film to test the surface residual strain as a reference point. Then for the same sample, 1 mL chlorobenzene solution was dripped on the film surface during the spin-coating process and the film was tested. Furthermore, the same sample was coated with Spiro-OMeTAD layer and then tested again. We found the same slope of the fitting curves indicating the magnitude of the surface strain remained constant. (Supplementary Fig.  10 ) It clearly shows that the chlorobenzene dripped process and/or Spiro-OMeTAD contacting layer does not affect the surface strain significantly. The residual strain and its gradient distribution reflects the structure inhomogeneity in the perovskite thin film along the vertical direction. It is known that the strain gradient is derived from the XRD peak offset, which actually reveals the variation of lattice parameters leading to the crystal structure mismatch across the thin film. In hybrid halide perovskites, the framework of corner-sharing PbI 6
octahedral contributes to the electronic configuration, especially at the band-edge 42 , 43 . It means variations in the inorganic framework would possibly result in the change in optoelectronic properties of the materials. The structure variations include enlargement/shrinkage, tilting, and other deformation of the octahedral network, which can be clearly illustrated by measuring the residual strain. Therefore, it is of great interest to bridge the gulf between the residual strain and the optoelectronic properties of the materials and relevant devices. Given the thin film surface exhibits the most significant strain, it is reasonable focus on the carrier dynamic behavior across the interface via strain modulation, and their effects on device performance. Impacts of strain on carrier dynamics and device performance To investigate the impact of the gradient residual strain on the device performance, we first fabricated planar heterojunction solar cells by adopting the perovskite absorbers with/without residual strains. The device architecture follows the regular structure of ITO/SnO 2 /perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag. We then compare the
J–V
curves of the tensile-strained and the strain-free devices. To avoid possible misleading due to sample variation, we fabricated 40 cells under optimal conditions in each batch. Figure  3a
shows the histograms of PCEs for each batch of samples with/without strain. The tensile-strained devices exhibited the PCE averaged around 18.7% with a wider distribution from 17.3% and 20.3%. In comparison, the strain-free devices achieved the averaged PCE of 19.8%, whose PCEs were distributed in a narrow range between 18.8% and 20.7%. The narrow distribution in PCEs of the strain-free devices stands for the good processing reproducibility. We also conducted the current–voltage ( I–V ) measurement for devices under different annealing conditions to preserve different tensile strains in the absorbers, which provided the statistics of parameters in Supplementary Fig.  1 1 and Supplementary Table  4 . It is found that the fill factor (FF) and the open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) have significantly improved with the increase of the flipped annealing time, wherein the surface tensile strain is gradually released through prolonged annealing at 120 °C.

Variation of recombination resistance as a function of applied voltage. PCE power conversion efficiency, TPC transient photocurrent, EIS electrochemical impedance spectroscopy Full size image We measured current-density voltage ( J–V ) characteristics of one of the best devices under a simulated illumination of air mass (AM) 1.5 and 100 mW cm −2 . This device generated a short-circuit current density ( J SC ) of 22.8 mA cm −2 , a FF of 78.0%, an open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 1.17 V, and a power conversion efficiency of 20.7% (Fig.  3b ). The forward and reverse scanning current density–voltage ( J–V ) curves showed negligible hysteresis in the corresponding device in Supplementary Fig.  11e , which was likely attributed to the improved carrier extraction at the interface 44 , 45 . By holding a bias near the maximum power output point (0.96 V), a stabilized photocurrent of 21.3 mA cm −2
was obtained, corresponding to a stabilized efficiency of 20.5% (the inset of Fig.  3b ). The device performance was certified by the independent third party (Supporting Information). The External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra for the two types of devices were shown in Supplementary Fig.  11f . Compared to the tensile strain device, the strain-free device showed improved light harvesting efficiency along the entire absorption wavelength range of 350 to 800 nm. The integrated photocurrent densities were calculated to be 20.81, 22.7 mA cm −2 , respectively, which was in good agreement with the
J SC
derived from the
J–V
measurement. Thus far, we observed the significant improvement in FF and
V OC
in strain-engineered devices. This is likely attributed to improved carrier extraction dynamics around the absorber interface, which is subjected to further analysis. Firstly, the carriers transport behavior at the interface was probed with transient photocurrent (TPC) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurement. The TPC measurement (Fig.  3c ) was often used to monitor the carrier transport across the device. By fitting with the exponential function, the photocurrent decay time was significantly reduced from 12.96 to 1.0 µs (Supplementary Table  5 ). A faster decay of photocurrent than the reference device suggested the improvement in carrier extraction when tensile strain gradient was almost eliminated at the surface. Further investigation with the TRPL measurement indicates improved hole extraction due to elimination of residual strain, as observed in the samples with the configuration of glass/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD. As shown in Supplementary Fig.  1 2 and Supplementary Table  6 , the average decay time
τ avg
related to PL quenching was dramatically decreased from 14.6 to 4.9 ns in the strain-free sample, showing the higher quenching rate. It indicates that the strain-free sample exhibits better hole extraction at the interface between absorber and hole transport material (HTM), as compared to that of the tensile strain sample. This result is in accordance with the TPC measurement, showing that modulation of residual tensile strain can accelerate the carrier transfer process. Secondly, we investigated how the carrier recombination process of devices is affected by the residual strain. We conducted the combined measurements of light-intensity-dependent
V OC , electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and transient photovoltage decay (TPV). The light-intensity-dependent
V OC
provides critical insights into the mechanism of recombination processes in solar cells 46 . The corresponding charge carrier recombination process is reflected by the ideality factor of ‘‘ n ’’ as determined by the slope of the
V OC
versus incident light-intensity according to the equation
V OC  =  E g / qnk B T / q ln J 0 / J ; where
q
is the elementary charge,
k B
is the Boltzmann constant, and
T
is the temperature. When the ideality factor
n
approaches 2, Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) type, trap-assisted recombination dominates. As shown in Fig.  3d , from the relationship between
V OC  ~ ln(I), the ideality factor
n
are 1.01, 1.55 for the devices with/without tensile strain, respectively. It indicates that trap-assisted SRH recombination is effectively suppressed by reducing the tensile strain that is mainly located at the absorber surface. The alleviated SRH recombination may be attributed to the reduced trap density in strain-free devices, wherein crystal structure homogeneity is achieved. The carrier dynamics across the perovskite/HTM interface upon strain modulation is further examined by EIS. Corresponding Nyquist plots were obtained from solar cells with/without gradient residual strain in dark without applied bias (Fig.  3e ). It shows two separate arcs, equivalent to the resistive and capacitive components of various interfaces 47 , 48 . Generally, the first arc in the intermediate-frequency region is associated with the recombination impedance due to the selective contacts or their interface with the perovskite active layer in the device. Here, we mainly focused on the mid-frequency region and found that the recombination impedance increased from 23.69 to 521.10 KΩ when the tensile strain was relaxed. It is consistent with that of the light-intensity-dependent
V OC
measurement. We further measured the recombination resistance ( R rec ), wherein the device was subjected to applied bias ranging from 0.4 to 1.0 V. By fitting with the simple RC equivalent circuit, we exacted the recombination resistance under different bias as shown in Fig.  3f . It is clear that strain-free devices display a larger
R rec
than that of the tensile-strained one, which indicates that the interfacial charge recombination is suppressed in strain-free device. The reduced recombination loss was further confirmed by TPV measurement 49 , wherein the photovoltage decay time was significantly increased from 4.01 to 10.32 µs (Supplementary Fig.  1 2 and Supplementary Table  5 ) when tensile strain was released. It is also in agreement with higher
V OC
observed in the devices with strain-free absorbers. Mechanisms of the effect of strain on photovoltaic properties The above results unambiguously indicate that the gradient distribution of residual strains directly affects the hole carrier dynamics across the perovskite/HTM interface and thus the device performance. To reveal the underlying mechanism, we performed first-principles calculations to simulate changes of electronic structure and optoelectronic properties of the perovskite films under strained condition. In particular, we chose the (001)-oriented FAPbI 3
perovskite film represented by six-layers Ruddlesden-Popper phase of FAPbI 3
and applied in-plane biaxial strains to it. Since (001) is one of predominate growth direction of perovskite crystals as indicated by the XRD measurements, and FAPbI 3 , MAPbBr 3
and their mixture have similar electronic structures 50 , 51 , we expect the above model can reasonably mimic the strained mixed perovskite (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15
films in experiment. We embedded the (001) FAPbI 3
film in the vacuum and applied biaxial strains of 1%, 0.5% (compressive) and –0.5%, –1% (tensile), respectively (Supplementary Fig.  13 ). We found that the perpendicular direction exhibit quite small opposite stain components as the rotation of organic FA/MA molecules contributes substantially to strain relaxation. The calculated band structures under tensile, zero, and compressive strains are shown in Fig.  4a ,  b . One sees that the band gaps of the films show increase with the strain changing from compression, zero-strain, to tension. This agrees with the observed tendency of bandgap change from the ultraviolet (UV)–visible (Vis) absorption and PL measurement (Fig.  4c ). To be noted, the bandgap measured from UV–Vis absorption and PL spectra less than the theoretical value. It is because the theoretical value was calculated with the assumption that the entire lattice structure is subjected to strain state. In our experiment however, the largest strain only locates at the surface region rather than the entire film (Fig.  1c ), wherein quite a large portion of films remain the original bandgap. The tendency can be explained by consideration of the band-edge features of Pb halide perovskites APbX 3 , where the valence band (VB) edge is composed of the strong anti-bonding interaction between Pb- s
and X- p
orbitals, and the conduction band (CB) edge is predominantly from Pb- p
orbital with weak anti-bonding character 51 , 52 . With the perovskite film experiencing compressive, zero, to tensile biaxial strain, the in-plane lattice gradually expands, which weakens the Pb–X bonds and thus in principle pulls down both the anti-bonding VB and CB energy levels. However, the VB with strong anti-bonding hybridization is substantially decreased, while the CB is less affected. As the result, the bandgap shows increase from compressive, zero, to tensile strain. This explanation is indeed supported by our calculations as shown in Fig.  4a . Fig. 4 Strain-induced electronic structure analysis.

The
J–V
characteristics of the hole-only space-charge-limited current (SCLC) device with/without residual tensile strain Full size image Based on the changed electronic structure in the strained perovskite, we attempt to illustrate how residual strains affect hole carrier dynamics in solar cells. Figure  4b
(left panel) shows the evolution of band-edge energies under tensile strains. The CB decreases slightly with increasing strain magnitude, whereas the VB exhibits pronounced downshift. It reveals that strains evolve vertically in the perovskite film, wherein the largest tensile strain is observed at the perovskite/HTM interface. Therefore, the VB bends downward monotonously over the entire perovskite absorber layer, as depicted in the Fig.  4b
(right panel). This VB downward bending has dual effects on the hole carrier dynamics. On one hand, it creates the ‘‘cliff-type’’ band alignment by repelling hole carrier energy level away from that of the HTM (Fig.  4b ). This was reported to be unfavorable for hole extraction in Cu(In,Ga)Se 2 53
and perovskite solar cells 54 , 55 , 56 , 57 , 58 . On the other hand, the hole mobility is possibly affected along the direction of VB downward bending, wherein the hole carrier diffusion suffers from extra hindering force field due to unfavored energy level gradient. As indicated by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement (Fig.  4d ) of the fabricated capacitor-like devices by sandwiching the perovskite films between ITO and Au, the mobilities of the samples with and without tensile strain were calculated to be 7.04 × 10 −4   and 1.02 × 10 −3  cm 2  V −1  S −1 , respectively. Indeed, the experimentally observed carrier mobility is improved when tensile strain is released. In short, by eliminating the tensile strain gradient in the perovskite film, the VB is flattened to cancel the ‘‘cliff-type’’ band alignment of perovskite absorber/HTM and hole mobility is enhanced simultaneously. It thus favors the charge transport and extraction of photogenerated holes, which suppresses the carrier recombination and leads to the significant improvement in FF and
V OC
in the corresponding device. In addition to the above two main effects, the tensile strain induced downward shift of valence bands may also result in the deeper defect levels of the perovskite films with the assumption of defect energy levels being not sensitive to strain. This is supported by the experimental observation that the hydrostatic pressure render the shallower defect energy levels of hybrid halide perovskites 59 , 60 . As demonstrated above we also observed the prolonged carrier lifetime in the strain-free samples (Supplementary Fig.  14 ). Discussion In conclusion, we revealed gradient evolution of residual strain in the vertical direction of the mixed halide perovskite film by depth-dependent grazing incident X-ray diffraction characterization. The residual strain distribution may be stemmed from composition inhomogeneity and/or gradient thermal stress during film processing. A simple technique was developed to modulate the strain nature (e.g., tensile and compressive) and its gradient over the perovskite film in a controllable manner. This allows us to identify substantial impact of the residual strain gradient on hole carrier dynamics across the perovskite solar cell. First-principle calculations reveal that the strain gradient induces valence bands bending of perovskite absorber and thus affects the interfacial hole dynamics. By reducing the strain gradient of the perovskite film through strain engineering, we achieved substantial improvement in hole carrier transport and extraction across the interface of perovskite absorber/HTM. Consequently, the optimized perovskite solar cell reaches the certified power conversion efficiency of 20.7%. By demonstrating the impact of residual strain on optoelectronic properties of halide perovskite film, this contribution sheds a light on further understanding the composition-structure-property relationship of halide perovskite system, which may be exploited to further advance the performance of halide perovskite based optoelectronic devices.

The HC(NH 2 ) 2 I and CH 3 NH 3 Br were prepared according to procedure mentioned in previous work. Perovskite precursor solutions The precursor solutions were prepared according to the work delivered by Saliba. FAMA perovskite solution: The mixed perovskite solution were prepared by mixing FAI (1.38 M), PbI 2
(1.49 M), MABr (0.24 M), PbBr 2
(0.26 M) in anhydrous DMF: DMSO 4:1 (v:v) according to previous work with a slight amount of excessive PbI 2 . To be convenient, we labeled the mixed perovskite solution with compositions mentioned above as FAMA 57 . CsI solutions: CsI solution was deposited by dissolving CsI in pure DMSO with the concentration of 1.5 M. (FAMA) (100- x ) Cs x
perovskite solution: (FAMA) (100- x ) Cs x
perovskite solution was obtained by adding appropriate amount of CsI into 300 μL FAMA perovskite solution with different cesium concentrations (volume ratio,
x  = 100% ×  V CsI /( V CsI  + 300)) to achieve the desired cation composition 5%. Optimal flipped annealing method for polycrystalline perovskite film The perovskite film washed by antisolvent was annealed about 20 min at 120 °C through the normal method in order to most of the solvent can escape smoothly, then it was flipped over and annealed 25 min at 120 °C so that the maximum tensile strain in the top surface can be gradually released at the highest temperature. In order to drop down the cooling rate at the same total annealing time, we first transferred the film to a hot stage at 80 °C for 1 min and then transferred to a hot stage at 40 °C for 1 min. All annealing processes are finished in in a nitrogen glove box. Sample preparation and devices fabrication The ITO substrate was sequentially washed with distilled water, acetone, ethanol, and isopropanol. After 30 min of UV–O 3
treatments, the SnO 2
electron transport layers (ETLs) were spin-coated on ITO substrates from the SnO 2
colloidal solutions, and annealed on a hot plate at the displayed temperature of 150 °C for 30 min in ambient air. For the mixed A-cation FA 0.85 MA 0.15 Pb(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3
and FA 0.85 MA 0.15 Cs 0.05 Pb(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3
metal halide perovskite layer, one-step method used toluene as antisolvent developed by Saliba was adopted. In detail, the perovskite solutions were spin-coated at 6000 rpm for 30 s. Two-hundred microliters of chlorobenzene was dropped on the spinning substrate during the spin-coating step at 10 s before the end of the procedure. Then, the as-fabricated film were baked at 120  ο C for 45 min in a nitrogen filled glove box. After the perovskite annealing, 30 μL Spiro-OMeTAD solution doped with LiTFSI and tBP was deposited at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The hole transport material (HTM) solution was prepared by dissolving 60 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 30 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine and 35 μL Li-TFSI/acetonitrile (260 mg mL −1 ) in 1 mL chlorobenzene. Finally, 100 nm Ag was thermally evaporated as counter electrode under a pressure of 5 × 10 −5
Pa on top of the hole transport layer to form the back contact. Fabrication of space-charge limited current devices The structure of the device was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD /Au. The ITO glass substrate was treated by UV–O 3
for 30 min, the PEDOT:PSS was filtered and then spin-coated on ITO substrates. FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
perovskite film was deposited on the PEDOT:PSS/ITO substrate by spin-coating. After the perovskite annealing, Spiro-OMeTAD layer was deposited and 150 nm Au was thermally evaporated as counter electrode. Characterizations The morphologies and sizes of nanocrystals were characterized by JEOL JEM-2100 transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were measured using Hitachi S4800 field-emission scanning electron microscopy. XRD patterns were recorded on a Rigaku smartlab X-ray Diffractometer. The cross-section of the device was prepared by focused ion beam (FIB) using a FEI Helios Dualbeam system. The sample was first covered by Pt protection layer deposited by electron beam and ion beam in dualbeam system, and was then milled to thin lamella following standard FIB sample preparation techniques. Due the beam-sensitivity of organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskite structure, low beam voltage, and current was applied during final cleaning steps. The as-prepared thin lamella was studied by high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) using a FEI Titan G2 microscope equipped by an aberration corrector for probe forming lens, operated at 300 kV. Depth-dependent steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurement was executed by confocal fluorescence microscope and time-resolved photoluminescence data was obtained by FLS980 (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd) with an excitation at 465 nm. The time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) measurements (Model TOF-SIMS V, ION-TOF GmbH) were performed with the pulsed primary ions from a Cs+ (3 keV) liquid-metal ion gun and a Bi+ pulsed primary ion beam for the analysis (25 keV). Current–voltage characteristics were recorded by using a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit. The typical current–voltage characteristics of the devices were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter by reverse scanning from 1.2 to −0.2 V or forward scanning from −0.2 to 1.2 V at a scanning speed of 50 mV s −1 . The photocurrent was measured under AM1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm −2
under a by 3A steady-state solar simulator (SS-F5-3A). Light-intensity was calibrated with a National Institute of Metrology (China) calibrated KG5-filtered Si reference cell. The effective area of each cell was 0.102 cm 2
defined by masks for all the photovoltaic devices discussed in this work. Space-charge limited current measurements were conducted on hole-only ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag devices. A Keithly 2400 source meter was used to measure the relevant
J–V
curves. The absorption spectra were measured by Hitachi UH4150 spectrophotometer. External quantum efficiencies (EQE) were performed on a solar cell quantum efficiency measurement system (QE-R) supported by Enli Technology Co., Ltd. A calibrated silicon diode with a known spectral response was used as a reference. The transient photovoltage/photocurrent (TPV/TPC) decay measurements were obtained on Molex 180081-4320 simulating one sun working condition, the carriers were excited by a 532 nm pulse laser. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was determined by the electrochemical workstation (Germany, Zahner Company), employing light emitting diodes driven by Export (Germany, Zahner Company). First-principles calculations Calculations were performed within the framework of density functional theory (DFT) by using plane-wave pseudopotential methods as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package 61 , 62 . The electron−ion interactions were described by the projected augmented wave pseudopotentials 63
with the 1 s
(H), 2 s
and 2 p
(C), 2 s
and 2 p
(N), 5 s
and 5 p
(I) and 5 d , 6 s
and 6 p
(Pb) electrons treated explicitly as valence electrons. We used the generalized gradient approximation formulated by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof 64
as the exchange correlation functional. Kinetic Energy cutoff for the plane-wave basis set were set to 400 eV. The k-point meshes with grid spacing of 2 π  × 0.03 Å −1
were used for electronic Brillouin zone integration. We modeled the perovskite film by using the (001)-oriented six-layers Ruddlesden-Popper phase of FAPbI 3
embedded in a vacuum region of 30 Å. The biaxial strains of 1%, 0.5% (compressive) and –0.5%, –1% (tensile) were applied to the film, respectively. The structures under the biaxial strain conditions were optimized by fixing the in-plane structure parameters of Pb–I perovskite framework through total energy minimization with the residual forces on the atoms converged to below 0.02 eV Å −1 . To properly take into account the long-range van der Waal interactions that play a nonignorable role in the hybrid perovskites involving organic molecules, the vdW-optB86b functional 65
was adopted. The alignment of the band structures upon different strains is made by using the vacuum energy as reference.

, Accepted 27th February 2019 First published on 28th February 2019 Abstract Small molecules, such as Spiro-OMeTAD, are widely used in photovoltaic devices including perovskite and dye-sensitized solar cells due to their excellent hole transport properties. However, this kind of small molecule is often used with hygroscopic additives and dopants suffering from aggregation and demixing under environmental stress and thus leading to pinholes/voids in the resultant films. By using typical molecular Spiro-OMeTAD as an example, we herein introduced a hydrophobic polymeric poly(4-vinylpyridine) (P4VP) component to substantially reduce the undesired pinholes during device fabrication and operation. It leads to a significant improvement of the long-term stability of devices, which kept 80% of their original PCE for over 6000 h in ambient air and the promotion of light stability. In addition, P4VP can saturate uncoordinated Pb sites in perovskite crystals, resulting in improved device performance (certified PCE of 20.6%) with negligible hysteresis. These results emphasize the effects of pinhole constraints in both the temporal and spatial perspectives, which provides a feasible approach to improve the stability of small-molecule-based hole transport materials for perovskite solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic halide perovskites have attracted tremendous attention in the photovoltaic field due to their excellent optoelectronic properties including a high absorption coefficient, 1,2
long charge carrier lifetime, 3,4
low trap density, 5
low-cost fabrication 6
and so on. With the continuous efforts from all over the world, the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have increased dramatically from 3.8% to a certified 23.7%. 2,7–13
Among all architectures, particularly regular (n–i–p) structured PSCs were extensively developed due to their simple fabrication and high efficiency. 13–15
A great deal of effort has been devoted into the exploration of ideal hole transport layer (HTL) materials, including polymers, small molecules, and inorganic species. Inorganic HTLs, mainly represented by CuI, 16
CuSCN 17
and NiO, 18
possess the advantages of both high mobility and low cost. However, it is difficult to deposit these inorganic HTLs on the top of perovskite materials without their damage and interaction, as the corresponding fabrication processes are mostly incompatible with the absorber underneath. 19
Polymeric materials such as commercial PTAA 20–22
and P3HT 23–25
can be well deposited on the perovskite layer. Due to their relatively low conductivity and consequently ultra-small thickness, they require perovskite films with great wettability, which makes the resulting solar cells rarely achieve a similar reproducibility level to that of the state-of-the-art device. 26
Small molecules are another class of HTLs that have been successfully used in perovskite solar cells due to their excellent photoelectric properties and the ease of processing. However, as an interlayer between the perovskite and electrode, these small molecules are not only required to transport holes but also are desired to be dense enough to retard the invasion of ambient small molecules (especially H 2 O and O 2 ), as well as ion diffusion between the perovskite components and electrode, which are crucial to efficient and stable PSCs.
Among small-molecule organic HTLs, Spiro-OMeTAD (Spiro) represents the most superb HTL because of its suitable highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels and excellent hole-extraction and transportation abilities. 27
Most of the state-of-art PSC devices are designed by using Spiro as the HTL. 11
However, as a small molecule, it is hard for Spiro to form pin-hole free and uniform thin films during spin coating due to its amorphous nature and the immiscibility of the Li-TFSI. The presence of pinholes largely deteriorates the optoelectronic properties and long-term stability of the resulting device. In addition, the conductivity of Spiro fails to meet the requirement for high performance devices. Therefore, most of the studies adopted a certain amount of Li-TFSI and 4- tert -butylpyridine (TBP) as effective additives/dopants 28
into Spiro to improve its conductivity. Unfortunately, these additives are highly hygroscopic, and can adsorb ambient moisture to segregate in the Spiro film, which results in extra pinholes in the doped film. These pinholes may allow small molecular species (such as H 2 O and O 2 ) in ambient air to invade the entire device, which leads to further degradation of PSCs. Meanwhile, the volatile species in the perovskite film such as CH 3 NH 2
and HI could easily diffuse out
via
the pinholes to interact with electrodes, 29
leading to the formation of metal halides that corrode the electrodes. 30
In view of the disadvantages of Spiro, some reports have accordingly prepared pinhole-free Spiro by changing the solvent from the commonly used chlorobenzene to chloroform, 29,31
or deposited Spiro films
via
vacuum evaporation, to improve the long-term stability of related devices. 32
These methods only work with Spiro films without additives, while for films with additives, a large number of pinholes are generated due to water adsorption and accumulation during device operation, inducing further degradation. Therefore, preventing pinhole formation in Spiro layers under outdoor operating conditions is a key challenge to achieve long-term stable PSCs based on small-molecule HTLs.
Here, by using Spiro as an example, we first proposed a simple approach to greatly improve the film quality of small molecule HTLs and the resulting long-term stability of the device. By introducing a long chain hydrophobic polymer poly(4-vinylpyridine) (P4VP) into the Spiro precursor solution, we successfully smoothed, strengthened and reduced the pinholes in the as-deposited HTL during the film deposition. Meanwhile, the pinhole formation caused by the water absorption of additives during device storage in high humidity was effectively suppressed, as is clearly revealed by
in situ
optical microscopy measurement. Non-encapsulated P4VP modified PSCs exhibit better long-term stability in ambient air (about 25–50% relative humidity) and retain 80% of their original PCE for over 6000 h storage. In addition, the efficiency of the PSC based on P4VP was elevated to be 20.6% (certified) with negligible hysteresis, since P4VP can effectively passivate the under-coordinated Pb in the perovskite films. These findings highlight the effective HTL modification by suitable molecules for both better long-term stability and improved photovoltaic performance of PSCs.
2. Results and discussion
To reduce the number of pinholes during small-molecule-based HTL formation using Spiro-OMeTAD, it is preferable to apply materials with excellent film-forming capability which are hydrophobic and miscible with Spiro. To this end, a “soft” polymer with a long carbon chain such as P4VP becomes an ideal candidate. The chemical structure of commercially available P4VP is shown in Fig. S1. †
We use P4VP as an example to investigate the compatibility between the small molecule and polymer for highly efficient perovskite solar cells with improved stability. For convenience, we denote the reference (Spiro doped with Li-TFSI and TBP) as Spiro and the target sample (Li-TFSI and TBP doped Spiro modified with P4VP) as Spiro:P4VP.
As a small molecule, Spiro is prone to easily form a certain number of pinholes during film deposition by the spin-coating method. 29,31
We observed similar results by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) ( Fig. 1a ) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) ( Fig. 1c ). Such pinholes dramatically reduce the quality of the HTL film, further deteriorating the corresponding photovoltaic performance and stability of PSCs. Surprisingly, by introducing an optimal amount of P4VP (1 mg mL −1 ), we successfully reduced the pinholes in the HTL film (Spiro:P4VP) compared to the pristine Spiro film, as shown in
Fig. 1b and d . In addition, the obvious surface roughness caused by such pinholes existing in Spiro is largely reduced by P4VP, as shown in
Fig. 1c and d , indicative of a dense and uniform HTL film. The root mean square roughness (RMS) for Spiro and Spiro:P4VP samples was measured to be 66 nm and 36 nm, respectively (Fig. S2 † ). In consideration of the “soft” characteristics of P4VP , which is easy to be cast into films, it is reasonable to expect that these polymers help to reduce such pinholes occurred in the Spiro layer.

(e) and (f) Contact angle measurements by dropping water on the top of Spiro and Spiro:P4VP films, respectively. (g) The Gibbs free energy variation (Δ G ) of adhesion for Spiro and Spiro:P4VP samples with water.
In addition to the pinhole formation when depositing the small molecule, extra pinholes developed because the Li-TFSI serves as a moisture adsorption center. Prevention of the possible moisture effects for PSCs is a key issue, and protects both the perovskite layer and carrier transport layer simultaneously. The molecules with a hydrophobic long alkyl group generally have lower wettability with water. Accordingly, we measured the contact angle of water on the top of the Spiro film and Spiro:P4VP film. The obtained value is 44° for Spiro and 91° for Spiro:P4VP film, respectively, as shown in
Fig. 1e and f . This implies that the P4VP modified HTL has superior hydrophobicity, which might better protect the perovskite and carrier transport film from water invasion. Actually the invasion process of water into Li-TFSI doped Spiro films is an adhesion process that involves three phases
e.g.
liquid, gas, and solid. Assuming a unit area at the interface of each phase, the change of Gibbs free energy during the process is as follows:   Δ G
=
γ l–s
−
γ l–g
−
γ s–g (1) where
γ l–s ,
γ l–g , and
γ s–g
are the surface energies of liquid–solid, liquid–gas and solid–gas. Among all surface energies,
γ l–g
can be directly measured through experiment and the value for water at room temperature is 0.072 N m −1 . According to Young's wetting formula,   γ s–g
=
γ l–s
+
γ l–g cos θ (2) where
θ
is the contact angle that can be deduced using   Δ G
= − γ g–l (1 + cos θ ) (3)
According to formula
(3)
we calculate Δ G
for the Spiro film and Spiro:P4VP film to be −0.124 and −0.071 J m −2 , respectively. The Spiro film exhibits lower Δ G
upon P4VP addition ( Fig. 1g ), which indicates that the water adhesion process is less favored from a thermodynamic point of view. It is further inferred that the P4VP modified Spiro film potentially improves the long term stability of the resultant devices, which is shown in the following part.
Accordingly, the
in situ
morphology evolution of the Spiro film and Spiro:P4VP film was characterized to gain further insight into the differences of the pinhole formation processes under moist conditions (80% relative humidity). In order to control humidity during the
in situ
evolution of the optical microscopy test, we set up a small humidifier and a hygrometer to precisely control the humidity when testing the sample. It has also been proved that the deviation of humidity in this case is less than 3%. As shown in
Fig. 2a and e , we selected the regions (0.20 × 0.25 mm 2 ) of Spiro and P4VP modified Spiro films before testing in a humid environment. It is observed that some pinholes were witnessed in the Spiro based film, but were absent in the P4VP modified film. With the prolongation of exposure time in the humid environment, we could observe that the pinholes in the Spiro film ( Fig. 2a–d ) were increased dramatically. By comparison, the introduction of P4VP into the Spiro film leads to a significantly reduced number of pinholes in the case of high humidity ( Fig. 2e–h ). We calculated the number of pinholes in Spiro and Spiro:P4VP samples as a function of time, as shown in
Fig. 2i . The significant difference between the two films indicates that P4VP is an effective polymer to prevent pinhole formation in the HTL in humidity. Therefore, through the P4VP molecule modification, it not only fills up the pinholes in small molecule films during its fabrication, but also prevents extra void formation due to hydrophilic Li-TFSI, which complies well with the results of contact angle measurements.

Combined with the
in situ
observation from optical microscopy images and hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristics of the P4VP component, the expected functionality of Spiro:P4VP hole transport materials is shown in
Fig. 2j . On one hand, hygroscopic Li-TFSI is much easier to adsorb surrounding water and thus produces extra pinholes. On the other hand, such pinholes existing in Spiro may provide more diffusion pathways for undesired ions, thereby causing further degradation of the entire solar cell. The presence of P4VP improves the mechanical properties of the whole layer due to elimination of pin holes, which helps to prevent the diffusion of small molecules (such as H 2 O and O 2
from surroundings and CH 3 NH 2
and HI from the perovskite film), and thus offers an efficient method to enhance the long-term stability of Spiro based PSCs.
The photovoltaic performance and stability of PSCs based on Spiro:P4VP were evaluated, and the Spiro based cells are used as a reference. As shown in Fig. S3, †
the devices based on Spiro:P4VP achieved an average PCE of 20.16%, which is higher than that of the Spiro-based cells (19.11%). The enhancement of the PCE is mainly associated with the significant improvement in the open-circuit photovoltage ( V oc ) and fill factor (FF).
Fig. 3a
shows the best Spiro:P4VP based device which produces a PCE of 20.84%, with a
V oc
of 1.129 V, a
J sc
of 23.49 mA cm −2 , and a FF of 78.57%. The forward and reverse scanning current density–voltage ( J – V ) curves showed reduced hysteresis in the resultant device compared to the reference. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in
Table 1 . By holding a bias near the maximum power output point, we obtained a stabilized efficiency of 19.31% for Spiro based and 20.34% for Spiro:P4VP based PSCs, respectively ( Fig. 3b ). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the two devices exhibit almost the same shape over the entire absorption wavelength range ( Fig. 3c ). The integrated photocurrent densities are also close to each other, indicating that P4VP has no obvious effect on the spectral response of the PSC devices. In addition, the best P4VP modified device was sent to the National Institute of Metrology, China (NIM, China) for certification, which confirmed a PCE of 20.6% under AM 1.5 G full-sun illumination (1000 W m −2 ) by reverse scan (1.2 to −0.1 V) and 19.8% under forward scan (−0.1 to 1.2 V), with a slow scan rate (33 mV s −1 ). The measurement details and results are shown in Fig. S4. †
This certified efficiency also agrees well with our internal measurement results.

To gain insight into the improvement of the
V oc
and the reduced hysteresis in the Spiro:P4VP based device, we fabricated hole-only devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PVSK/Spiro or Spiro:P4VP/Au) to measure the trap-state density and the hole mobility in the full device.
Fig. 3d
shows the dark state
I – V
curves of these two devices. The linear relationship indicates an “ohmic region” response of the hole-only device at low bias voltage. With the bias voltage increasing, the current quickly increases nonlinearly, demonstrating that the trap-states begin to be filled until the trap-filled limit is achieved. The trap-filled limit voltage ( V TFL ) of the perovskite films covered with Spiro and Spiro:P4VP is 0.98 and 0.64 V, respectively. Then the trap-state density can be determined from the
V TFL
using the equation:
, where
q
is the elementary charge of the electron,
L
is the perovskite film thickness, and
ε
and
ε 0
are the relative dielectric constant and the vacuum permittivity. Therefore, the hole trap-state density of the Spiro based perovskite is 9.64 × 10 15
cm −3 , in good agreement with previous reports, 33
while this value is reduced to 6.29 × 10 15
cm −3
for the Spiro:P4VP based perovskite, indicating that the film quality is much improved. At a high bias voltage the current shows a linear relationship with the square of the voltage ( I
∝
V 2 ). We thus obtain carrier mobility from the Mott–Gurney law:
; 34
the mobilities ( μ ) of the samples with and without P4VP modification are calculated to be 0.18 cm 2
V −1
s −1
and 0.17 cm 2
V −1
s −1 , respectively. The enhancement of hole mobility and the reduction of defect state density in the perovskite film improve the resulting optoelectronic properties of the devices. This is also consistent with the reduced photoluminescence (PL) spectral response and shorter lifetime obtained by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurement (Fig. S5, S6, Table S1 † ). The increase in carrier mobility and the decrease in the density of defects are likely attributed to the lone pair electrons of nitrogen which may coordinate with dangling lead atoms near the perovskite/HTL interface, passivating positive under-coordinated Pb defects and inhibiting the recombination of carriers. 35,36
In order to provide more direct evidence regarding the Pb coordination situation, we conducted X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement. As shown in Fig. S7, †
the binding energy with respect to 4f 7/2
of divalent Pb 2+
in the reference (bare perovskite film) and the sample covered with P4VP was measured to be 138.9 eV and 138.6 eV, respectively. Compared with the pristine perovskite film, the binding energies of Pb valence electrons exhibit a slight shift toward lower values when treated with P4VP. It is reported that species with lone pair electrons of the pyridine group in P4VP can form coordination bonds when interacting with undercoordinated Pb atoms, which decreases the binding energy of Pb 4f orbitals. This thus indicates that P4VP plays an important role in defect passivation, which is in line with previous reports. 37
Additionally, to further understand the charge carrier dynamics in the PSCs, we performed a transient photovoltage (TPV) measurement which is related to charge carrier recombination and transient photocurrent (TPC) measurement which is related to charge carrier transportation. These tests have proven to be effective and have been extensively applied to Cu 2 ZnSnS 4
solar cells 38
and PSCs. 15,39
According to
Fig. 3e , we found that the Spiro:P4VP based cell had a longer photovoltage decay time than that of the Spiro based device (the values are 0.70 μs and 0.51 μs, respectively, in Table S2 † ), which implied that the introduction of P4VP reduced the PVSK/HTL interfacial defects and thus decreased the charge carrier recombination rate consistent with published literature results. 36,37
As shown in
Fig. 3f , the devices modified with PV4P exhibited faster photocurrent decay (220 ns) than that of Spiro based devices (310 ns), which further confirmed that the carrier transport in the devices was improved by P4VP modification.
Fig. 3g
shows Nyquist plots of the solar cells tested in the dark with applied bias. From the two separate arcs and the corresponding equivalent circuit, we could derive the recombination resistance ( R rec ) at low frequency and the contact resistance ( R co ) at high frequency. Obviously, the Spiro:P4VP based device has a larger value of
R rec
(about 50.3 kΩ) than the Spiro based cell (about 44.7 kΩ). The larger
R rec
could effectively suppress the charge recombination, to improve the device performance. With respect to
R co , it was observed that the Spiro:P4VP based device has a smaller value than the Spiro based cell. This result revealed that the Spiro:P4VP based cell has more efficient hole transportation within the entire device. To further study the recombination kinetics, we measured the
J sc
and
V oc
of the cells at various light intensities from 105 mW cm −2
to 34 mW cm −2 .
Fig. 3h
shows a linear relationship between
J sc
and light intensity. Specifically, the Spiro and Spiro:P4VP based devices show a slope of 0.98 and 0.99, respectively. Both slopes are essentially equal to 1 (the cell with Spiro:P4VP is closer), indicating that there are no significant energy barriers and space charge limits for the charge extraction process in the two devices. 40 Fig. 3i
shows that
V oc
varies logarithmically (ln( I )) with light intensity, and the slopes for the Spiro and Spiro:P4VP based devices are 1.61 kT / q
and 1.57 kT / q , respectively. Generally, the corresponding charge carrier recombination process is reflected by the value of ideality factor ( n ), which is determined by the slope of the
V oc versus
incident light intensity
, where
q
is the elementary charge,
k B
is the Boltzmann constant, and
T
is the temperature. It is known that the ideality factor
n
approaching 2 reflects the Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) type trap-assisted recombination. Therefore the solar cells based on Spiro:P4VP possess reduced trap state density, resulting in suppressed J– V
hysteresis and improved device efficiency.
Then we tracked the stability of the PSC devices. In order to reduce the deviation caused by the small number of samples, 10 devices were measured in each group, which is considered of statistical significance. The normalized PCE as a function of the storage time in air environment (relative humidity: 25–50%, temperature: 25–40 °C) is shown in
Fig. 4a . The unencapsulated Spiro:P4VP cells retain 80% of their original PCE (the average value is 19.02%) for over 6000 h storage in ambient air, which is comparable with other reports (Fig. S8 † ). This means that the modification of HTL film quality and hydrophobicity by introducing P4VP plays an important role in the long-term stability of the device. We further explored the illumination stability and thermal stability of these devices.
Fig. 4b
reveals the device performance evolution upon continuous 1 sun illumination. When P4VP was employed in the Spiro, the device retained 90% of its original PCE after about 700 h (while that of the device based on Spiro under the same illumination conditions dropped to 80% after 550 h). In addition, with respect to thermal stability, several previous studies reported that small molecule Spiro-OMeTAD would form pinholes under thermal conditions due to its low glass transition temperature, which increased the contact between the perovskite and electrodes and further induced the device performance degradation. 41
However, by modifying the Spiro film with P4VP we obtained an impressive result: 80% of the original PCE was maintained under continuous 85 °C heating after 300 h (that of the device based on Spiro under thermal conditions drops to 80% after 50 h). All of these stability tests demonstrate that the decrease of pinholes by P4VP inhibits the pinhole formation, due to the hydrophobic carbon chain and its soft characteristics, which effectively suppress the film degradation and lead to a better device stability.

(b) PSC device stability upon continuous illumination in a nitrogen atmosphere for Spiro and Spiro:P4VP based samples. (c) PSC device stability upon continuous heating at 85 °C for Spiro and Spiro:P4VP based samples.
In order to explore the underlying mechanism of stability improvement, we performed high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy measurements on the devices. The spatial distribution of Ag in the aged devices, including Spiro and Spiro:P4VP, is shown in
Fig. 5 . The thickness of the perovskite containing Pb and I (mainly) elements, HTL and Ag electrode was about 500, 200 and 100 nm respectively. Apparently, for the Spiro based devices ( Fig. 5a ), substantial Ag signals were observed to penetrate through the entire device layer after 30 days of aging in a humid environment. However, in the sample with Spiro:P4VP, the Ag signals were only observed in the original layer without apparent diffusion ( Fig. 5e ). This suggests that P4VP modified Spiro effectively inhibits the diffusion of Ag ions. The reason is obvious that the P4VP was used early as a selective ion-exchange and chelate-forming resin which can achieve optimum sorption of metal ions
via
coordinating with pyridine groups. 42
Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that P4VP can also inhibit the penetration of Ag ions through chelation and coordination since it contains pyridine nitrogen which is known as an excellent ligand for silver ions. This also explains why P4VP can prevent Ag ions from spreading. In addition to the suppression of Ag diffusion, we also found that Spiro:P4VP could suppress the diffusion of iodine ions. It is reported that when compared to inert nitrogen, ambient air easily accelerates the corrosion of Ag electrodes, and factually this means that oxygen from air oxidizes HI into water and iodine and the iodine and metallic silver form AgI easily, where methyl ammonium iodide migration is facilitated by the small pinholes in the hole transport layer Spiro-MeOTAD. 29
The formation of silver iodide significantly increased the series resistance and
J – V
hysteresis of the corresponding devices. Moreover, the inter-diffusion of ions further accelerates the degradation of the device which is unfavorable to long-term stability. 43
The device based on Spiro:P4VP effectively reduces the pinhole of the HTL, thus inhibiting the diffusion of Ag and I ions, improving the device optoelectronic performance and long-term stability.

3. Conclusion
In summary, we have developed a general pinhole suppression method to improve the stability of small-molecule-based HTLs in perovskite solar cells. It successfully reduces the intrinsic pinholes of Spiro during film fabrication and suppresses the void formation during long-term exposure to humid air. The improvement of device stability is ascribed to the pinhole constraint in both temporal and spatial perspectives. P4VP modified PSCs exhibited excellent stability and can endure more than 6000 h in ambient air (still keeping 80% of their original PCE) without any encapsulation. This is partially attributed to the successful suppression of iodine migration and silver diffusion. Moreover, after using P4VP, we obtained a certified PCE of 20.6% in the resulting device. These findings provide a new approach to the fabrication of pinhole free HTLs for efficient perovskite solar cells with improved stability.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Materials
All reagents were used as received without further purification, including PbI 2
(99.999%, Sigma-Aldrich), CsI (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), P4VP (AR 98%, Aladdin Industrial Corporation), Spiro-OMeTAD (Lumtec), SnO 2
colloid precursor (Alfa Aesar, tin( IV ) oxide, 15% in H 2 O colloidal dispersion),
N , N -dimethylformamide (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), dimethyl sulfoxide (99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich), isopropanol (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), chlorobenzene (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), acetone (AR Beijing Chemical Works), ethanol (AR Beijing Chemical Works), aminomethane (CP Beijing Chemical Works), hydrogen iodide (57%, Aladdin Industrial Corporation), 4- tert -butylpyridine (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), acetonitrile (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) and ITO substrate (Shanghai B-Tree Tech. Consult.). The methylamine iodide (CH 3 NH 3 I), formamidine iodide (HC(NH 2 ) 2 I), methylamine chlorine (CH 3 NH 3 Cl) and methylamine bromine (CH 3 NH 3 Br) were synthesized using the methods reported everywhere.
4.2 Device fabrication
The ITO substrate was sequentially cleaned with ultrapure water, acetone, ethanol and isopropanol. After 45 minutes of UV–O 3
treatments, an 80 nm-thick layer of the SnO 2
film was spin-coated on the substrate with a SnO 2
nanocrystal solution at 4000 rpm for 30 s two times, and then annealed at 150 °C for 30 min in air. The standard perovskite film was fabricated by a two-step solution process: PbI 2
(1.3 M, dissolved in DMF : DMSO (9 : 1, v:v)) mixed with 5% CsI was spin coated on ITO/SnO 2
at 2500 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 70 °C for 1 min in a nitrogen glovebox. After cooling the PbI 2
coated substrate to room temperature in the nitrogen glovebox, mixed organic cation solution (MAI 0.12 M; MABr 0.05 M; MACl 0.07 M; FAI 0.23 M, dissolved in isopropanol) was spin-coated at 2300 rpm for 30 s and then annealed at 150 °C for 15 min in air. Then the HTM solution, a Spiro-OMeTAD/chlorobenzene (60 mg mL −1 ) solution with the addition of 28 μL Li-TFSI/acetonitrile (260 mg mL −1 ) and 24 μL 4- tert -butylpyridine, was deposited by spin-coating at 3500 rpm for 30 s. Finally, the device was finished by thermal evaporation of Au (100 nm) under vacuum. For the P4VP doped perovskite film we just dissolve P4VP with CB and filter, getting a clear solution, and use it as a solvent to dissolve Spiro-OMeTAD, and the content of P4VP is about 0.2 mg mL −1 . Other sections are all the same with the standard sample.
4.3 Characterization
The morphology of Spiro-OMeTAD was determined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (SEM, Hitachi S-4800). Photoluminescence (PL) and transient-state photoluminescence (TRPL) were measured by using an FLS980 (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd) with an excitation at 470 nm. The TPV and TPC measurements were performed on a Molex 180081-4320 simulating one sun working conditions, and the carriers were excited by using a 532 nm pulse laser. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed by using an electrochemical workstation (Germany, Zahner Company), employing light emitting diodes driven by Export (Germany, Zahner Company). The current density–voltage characteristics of the perovskite devices were obtained using a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit under AM 1.5 G illumination at 1000 W m −2
with a Newport Thermal Oriel 91192 1000 W solar simulator. External quantum efficiencies were measured by using an Enli Technology (Taiwan) EQE measurement system. The high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) measurement was performed by using a FEI Titan G2 microscope equipped with an aberration corrector for probe forming lens.

, Accepted 15th April 2019 First published on 15th April 2019 Abstract Organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites with over 23% power conversion efficiency have attracted enormous academic and industrial attention due to their low-cost fabrication and high device performance. Self-passivated tin oxide as an electron transport layer has shown potential mainly due to the enhanced electron transfer, stability and reduced hysteresis device features. Here we report on novel, non-colloidal tin oxide precursors based on acetylacetonate (one halide free and two halogenated with Cl and Br respectively). We explore the unique film morphology acquired from the non-colloidal precursors and the improved device performance they yield. Our results show that the halide residue in the films plays an impactful role in the thermal durability of the fabricated SnO 2
film, as well as providing a passivation layer. Moreover, our optimized tin oxide films achieved an unprecedented power conversion efficiency of 22.19% in planar perovskite solar cells (21.4% certified by Newport), and once upscaled to large-area modules, 16.7% devices based on a 15 cm 2
area were achieved.
Broader context
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are efficient photovoltaic devices composed of a light absorbing layer which is sandwiched between two charge extracting layers. Passivated tin oxide is extensively used as an electron extracting layer due to its excellent optoelectronic properties. Here, we fabricate high-performing passivated tin oxide films with three novel metalorganic precursors based on acetylacetonate complexes. We demonstrate with various tools the film morphology, optoelectronic properties, and elemental analysis yielded with each precursor and correlated with the device performance. Our champion devices obtained a 22.19% and 16.7% power conversion efficiency for small-sized cells and 15 cm 2
mini-module devices, respectively.
Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells are swiftly emerging as standalone photovoltaic technology. Since the first study by Kojima
et al. , the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has undergone rapid improvement from 3.8% to over 23% in under a decade of development. 1–3
The high efficiency attained from perovskite materials is due to their excellent optoelectronic properties, which were optimized by adjusting the composition and ratio of cations and anions within the perovskite lattice. 4,5
These compositionally engineered, photoactive perovskite layers can be deposited using either one or two step solution processable methods. 6–8,15,22
In addition to the perovskite composition, the horizon of research has expanded to enhancing the electron transporting layer (ETL), 9–11
perovskite absorber and hole transporting layers (HTL) 12,13
and implementing scalable fabrication techniques. 14
For TiO 2
based ETLs, relatively high resistivity is known to cause insufficient charge separation at the compact TiO 2
(c-TiO 2 )/perovskite interface. 16–18
Therefore, an additional layer of mesoporous TiO 2
(mp-TiO 2 ) is usually adopted to complement the deficient charge collection. 16–18
Recently, SnO 2
based electron transporting layers have been extensively used due to SnO 2 's high conductivity and superior charge collection ability compared to TiO 2
ETLs. 19–21
SnO 2
has a wide bandgap ranging between 3.6 and 4.1 eV, and its favourable conduction band edge in relation to perovskites makes SnO 2
a good candidate to overcome challenges which occur particularly with c-TiO 2
ETLs. 23
Previously, low-temperature processes were mostly used to form SnO 2
layers to avoid pin-holes on an FTO or ITO substrate with a rough film surface. However, the metal-like nature shown in degenerate semiconductors,
i.e. , the carrier density of non-doped SnO 2
is
ca.
10 20
cm −3
(in the range of semimetals), seems to generate another serious shunting pathway, decreasing the fill factor (FF) and open-circuit voltage ( V oc ). 25,26
We have demonstrated previously that the low PCE is due to the deteriorated hole-blocking ability of the SnO 2
ETL caused by loss of self-passivating materials such as SnOCl 2
and residual precursor of tetrakis-dimethyl-amine-tin (TDMASn). 21,24
By using different precursors and depositing them with various techniques such as spin-coating and atomic layer deposition methods, we proved the advantages of the low-temperature process are not limited to preventing pin-holes but also include electrically passivating the SnO 2
ETL. 21,24
In this work, we investigated the film and device performance for planar-type perovskite solar cells using tin acetylacetonate based precursors for SnO 2 . To better understand the role of halides, one of the chosen precursors is halide-free and two are based on chloride and bromide respectively. The optimized devices achieved a high efficiency of 22.19% in a small-size cell and 16.73% in a large area 15 cm 2
module.
Device structure
Fig. 1
shows the device architecture of a planar perovskite solar cell consisting of fluorine-doped SnO 2
(FTO)/c-TiO 2 /SnO 2 /perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/gold layers. In our previous work, we confirmed that the ‘Type 1’ passivation ETL by combining a c-TiO 2
underlayer with the passivated tin oxide (PTO) top layer provides better hole-blocking ability than a single passivated SnO 2
layer, which resulted in the further enhanced PCE. 21,24
For tin oxide layers, we investigated three metalorganic tin precursors from the same family, tin( II ) bis(acetylacetonate) (hereafter Acac), tin( IV ) bis(acetylacetonate) dichloride (hereafter Cl 2 ) and tin( IV ) bis(acetylacetonate) dibromide (hereafter Br 2 ), with DMF as a solvent.

Film and device characteristics
The structure of the SnO 2
films is characterized with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Films are prepared by dropping precursor solutions on a carbon support grid and heat-treating at 180 °C for 1 h in air. Pairs of bright field (BF) and dark field (DF) TEM images and corresponding selected area electron diffraction patterns (SAEDP) are presented in
Fig. 2 . The SAEDP show reflections for [110], [101], [200], and [211] index planes for all films, corresponding to rutile-type SnO 2 . TEM images show that the films are comprised of small crystallites (<2 nm), as is further confirmed by high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) images (Fig. S2, ESI † ). The acquired TEM images and SAEDPs indicate the co-presence of short to medium range ordered regions in the SnO 2
films, a property which we previously observed in SnO 2
films prepared with
e.g.
colloidal SnCl 4 21
and atomic layer deposited TDMASn 24
at low temperature. We monitored the composition of the films using energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry in scanning TEM mode (EDXS-STEM). High-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM images and corresponding EDXS elemental maps (Fig. S1, ESI † ) indicate that the layers formed from all the precursors are comprised of Sn and O elements, as well as residual halogenated by-product, after post-annealing at 180 °C for Cl 2
and Br 2
films. High-resolution TEM images are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI † ). For the Acac film, plenty of pinholes and randomly sized crystallites are observed. On the other hand, other precursor films have compact surfaces with an average crystallite size of around 2 nm and 1 nm respectively for Cl 2
and Br 2
films.

layer. Bright-field (BF) and dark-field (DF) TEM images of SnO 2
films deposited on a carbon support grid, and corresponding selected area electron diffraction patterns (SAEDP). Simulated electron diffraction pattern of rutile-type SnO 2
is included at the lower left part of the SAEDP.
To evaluate the compatibility for the ETL, we measured the photoluminescence (PL) of the bi-layered electron transporting layer (BETL)/perovskite films as seen in
Fig. 3a . Despite differences in the PL intensity, all BETLs show a faster electron quenching efficiency than the c-TiO 2
film. According to the result, Acac shows the fastest quenching rate, and Cl 2
and Br 2
show slightly slower electron transfer as indicated by the PL peaks. Therefore, a higher PCE was expected with the Acac devices, but the device performance demonstrated in
Fig. 3b
shows that the trend of the PL measurement does not match well with the device efficiency. The highest PCE is gained from the Cl 2
precursor due to the contribution of enhanced FF and
V oc . For Br 2 , the high
V oc
is promising. However, the Br 2
devices show a relatively low FF and a slightly lower short-circuit current density ( J sc ) than c-TiO 2 . Unlike the PL result, we found that the Acac precursor may not contribute to distinct efficiency enhancement. To explain this observation, we utilized scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to examine the surface morphology of SnO 2
fabricated with Acac. The full-size image of the complete cells is shown in Fig. S3 (ESI † ). Moreover, we performed absorbance and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) on SnO 2
samples spin-coated with perovskite as seen in Fig. S4 (ESI † ) and examined the perovskite surface morphologies with SEM as seen in Fig. S5 (ESI † ). The absorbance, XRD pattern and SEM imaging confirm that the perovskite films deposited on SnO 2
have roughly similar thickness and morphology regardless of the SnO 2
precursor. However, in the cross-sectional SEM images in Fig. S5 (ESI † ), the Cl 2
and Br 2
films clearly show an increase in the SnO 2
film thickness. However, for the Acac devices, there is no observable increase of the ETL thickness when compared with the c-TiO 2
SEM cross-sectional image. Fig. S6 (ESI † ) shows SEM top-view images of c-TiO 2
and c-TiO 2 /PTO films formed on the FTO substrate. The magnified images show all SnO 2
precursors form a thin and similarly uniform top layer over the c-TiO 2
underlayer. However, different film morphology can be observed for the SnO 2
prepared with Acac when the magnification is increased. Randomly distributed big particles potentially caused by the aggregation of the precursor are detected on the film surface. The particle sizes range from 1 to 2 μm in diameter and induce huge bumps on the perovskite film as seen in Fig. S7 (ESI † ). The poor morphology in Acac films could be due to the meta-stability of the tin oxidation state. For Acac, the Sn 2+
metal center is four coordinate with two bidentate acetylacetonate ligands. While for Cl 2
and Br 2 , the Sn 4+
metal atom is six coordinate with two bidentate acetylacetonate ligands and two monodentate halogen ligands. In this configuration, Sn 4+
is more likely to be stable in a DMF solution, unlike the case with Sn 2+ , which could be oxidized more readily in DMF. In a preliminary test, we found that Acac dissolves easily in DMF and forms a transparent solution, but starts to precipitate in a couple of hours as seen in Fig. S7 (ESI † ). Whereas for Cl 2
and Br 2
dissolved in DMF, the solutions do not lose transparency over a month. For Acac, the bumps observed in Fig. S7 (ESI † ) could potentially provide a shunting route particularly for planar-type cells by forming a thin PTO layer which increases the possibility of pinhole formation. These findings indicate that there are complex challenges associated with Acac in terms of film reproducibility and performance. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was further performed to characterize the Cl 2
and Br 2
films. Strong peaks at 486 and 494 eV attributed to Sn 4+
ions indicate the formation of SnO 2
as seen in
Fig. 3d . A weak asymmetry shown in all spectra can be explained by Sn 2+
ions originating from oxygen vacancies ( V oc ) on the SnO 2
surface, which are assumed to be the origin of the high conductivity of the SnO 2
film. 24
Strong asymmetry of the spectra indicating the presence of sub-bonds is also observed in the O 1s region ( Fig. 3e ), which is associated with the binding energy for the O–S bond (Sn 4+ ) with higher intensity at 529.2 eV. The smaller peak at 530.5 eV can be associated with oxygen impurities such as OH ligands and water adsorption on the film. 27
In addition, we found a small peak assigned to Cl 2p at 197 eV from the Cl 2
film, and a strong peak of Br 3d at 68 eV from the Br 2
film. This is in good agreement with the result of EDX analysis in Fig. S1 (ESI † ). For the Cl 2
film, when varying the annealing temperature, the highest intensity peak of the film slightly decreases from 100 °C to 180 °C annealing. Moreover, the Cl bond peak is still present at 220 °C but is significantly minimized. A similar trend is observed from the Br 2
film, however, it is noteworthy that the intensity of the Br 3d peak remains strong even when annealing at 220 °C.

To find the optimal annealing temperature, we carefully prepared SnO 2
films between 160 °C and 350 °C for Cl 2
and Br 2 .
Fig. 4a
shows a statistical summary of the device efficiency with respect to temperature. The best PCE is found at 200 °C for Cl 2 , while the highest PCE is obtained at 220 °C for the Br 2
device. It should be noted that the Br 2
devices show a relatively gentle drop of PCEs at high temperatures while the Cl 2
devices demonstrate a steep decrease after the maximum value. Both devices show a rapid increase of
J sc
according to the ramping of the temperatures until the maximum
J sc
is reached (close to 24 mA cm −2
at 200 °C). An analogous trend is observed in the FF. Although a high FF is shown with the 160 °C devices, we found a severe drop of electron transfer as seen in Fig. S8 (ESI † ). Here, it is noteworthy to remember the film formation of the tin oxide layer from SnCl 4
and other chloride-based precursors. 18,19
Unlike Cl 2 /Br 2
precursors in DMF, SnCl 4
immediately reacts with H 2 O to form SnO 2
nanoparticles and amorphous SnOCl 2
which are not reversibly dissolved in water, indicating the solution is in fact colloidal. 18
As with water-based colloidal SnO 2
precursors
i.e. , AlfaAesar 15% SnO 2 , an impressively low temperature processing is required, 150 °C. 20
However, surface passivation can potentially occur by SnOCl 2
and base sources potentially added for stable dispersion of the colloid,
i.e.
NaOH, KOH, 28
if SnO 2
nanoparticles are synthesized using chlorine based tin precursors (Fig. S9, ESI † ). Therefore, despite a lower device performance, the film contains more crystalline SnO 2 , therefore no current loss (decrease of
J sc ) is found despite film drying at 100 °C. However, the Cl 2 /Br 2
precursors do not visibly react with DMF and sustain their solution form, which means smaller or fewer SnO 2
crystallites can be formed at low temperatures, and more residual precursor exists on the film, which can cause higher series resistance at low-temperature annealing. This explains the reason for the different behaviour shown in
Fig. 4a and b . With the same reason, a high
V oc
is measured for the 160 °C film probably caused by electron accumulation. An unexpected result is found from the
V oc
trend of the Br 2
devices. A gradual drop of
V oc
is seen when increasing the annealing temperature beyond 250 °C. Nevertheless, the Br 2
devices maintain a
V oc
over 1.1 V even at 350 °C. This result implies that the bromide residue is more strongly bound to the film than the chloride counterpart, even at exceptionally high annealing temperature. Further statistical comparison with mp-TiO 2
based cells is summarized in Fig. S10 (ESI † ). To supplement this analogy thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted and is displayed in
Fig. 4b . For both Cl 2
and Br 2
the precursors start to lose weight at
ca.
150 °C, mainly attributed to thermal decomposition. For Cl 2 , roughly 90% of weight is lost by crystallization at 250 °C, followed by a gradual weight drop implying complete removal of Cl on the film. Br 2
shows rather slower weight loss, and the conversion to SnO 2
appears to finish roughly at 300 °C. The subsequent drop that goes up to 500 °C can be attributed to removal of residual Br. Considering Cl sublimes more easily than Br, this finding is reasonable. The TGA curves further support the result and agree well with the EDX and XPS results.
J – V
curves at the optimal conditions are depicted in
Fig. 4c . PTO layers clearly show better PCEs. The highest PCE of 21.12% is obtained from Cl 2 . A bit lower PCE is measured with Br 2 , but it also shows a high PCE over 20%, which is still higher than that with a single c-TiO 2
ETL. We confirmed the optimized bi-layered c-TiO 2 /PTO layers show lower PL emission than the 180 °C films ( Fig. 4d ). We measured the reflectance of the films, and the optical bandgap ( E g ) was calculated by applying the Kubelka–Munk ( F ( R )) method 27
by plotting ( F ( R ) ×
hν ) 2
as a function of energy. Subsequently, an
E g
of 3.92 and 3.93 eV for Cl 2
and Br 2
respectively was estimated ( Fig. 4e ). Fermi-levels ( E f ) were measured by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), confirming that both Cl 2
and Br 2
films have the same
E f
of 4.21 eV. The
E g
and
E f
estimations imply that the Cl 2
and Br 2
films possess similar optical and electronic properties. Additionally, the c-TiO 2 /Cl 2
ETL was tested for a monolithic series module, and a 16.73% PCE was obtained with a 15 cm 2
aperture area (Fig. S11, ESI † ).

The best device seen in
Fig. 5a
shows promising photovoltaic values in a planar structure with a
J sc
of 24.78 mA cm −2 , a
V oc
of 1.13 V, a FF of 0.79, and a PCE of 22.19% under 1 sunlight illumination conditions when scanned backward. With forward scanning, the values are slightly lower, and very small
J – V
curve hysteresis is measured in a planar-type device. We assume the better PCE is from extended light absorption and enhanced perovskite film quality as seen in the EQE and SEM top-view images (Fig. S12 and S13, ESI † ). We confirmed the
J sc
value from the solar simulator agrees with the calculated
J sc . The device shows excellent performance in the stabilized condition measurement ( Fig. 5b ). We also found BETL based perovskite cells have outstanding long-term stability until 200 days when cells are stored in a drawer without encapsulation (Fig. S14, ESI † ). To get reliable data, our cells are measured again at Newport. Although a small loss of
V oc
is found potentially due to use of a smaller active area and possible degradation in air, a similar and certified PCE of 21.37% on average was confirmed ( Fig. 5c
and Fig. S15, ESI † ).

Conclusions
We investigated the film and device performance with non-colloidal SnO 2
precursors based on acetylacetonate, namely tin( II ) acetylacetonate (Acac), tin( IV ) bis(acetylacetonate) dichloride (Cl 2 ) and tin( IV ) bis(acetylacetonate) dibromide (Br 2 ). We have confirmed with TEM the presence of rutile type SnO 2
in the film with varying degrees of crystallinity, contributing to self-passivation and improved device performance. Moreover, while the Acac precursor produced randomly sized and distributed SnO 2
crystallites, Cl 2
and Br 2
produced dense SnO 2
films with a passivating, halogenated by-product. In addition, we demonstrated the ability of Br 2
to retain the
V oc
of the devices with up to 350 °C annealing post-treatment due to the delayed sublimation of the bromide by-product as confirmed with TGA. This finding could extend the application of passivated tin oxide to high-temperature processed perovskites such as lead-free CsSnI 3 . Ultimately, we confirm the importance of surface passivation for SnO 2 , specifically for perovskite solar cell applications due to its metal-like nature. Cl 2
and Br 2
are proved to provide excellent surface passivation to enhance the hole-blocking ability. The champion cell achieved a PCE of 22.19% and was obtained using Cl 2 . Our findings highlight the importance of passivation for SnO 2
and suggest inspiring ideas for broader and diverse passivation routes for SnO 2
based solar cells.

Film and device fabrication
FTO glass substrates (Nippon sheet glass) were sequentially cleaned with detergent and ethanol. A compact TiO 2
layer was coated by spray pyrolysis deposition on the cleaned FTO substrates heated at 450 °C. SnO 2
layers are prepared by spin-coating a precursor solution of tin acetylacetonate based precursors dissolved in dimethylformamide. 0.1 M SnCl 4
aqueous solution was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 10 s on the substrates to get a ∼20 nm thickness. Then the substrates were transferred onto a hotplate and heated between 160 °C and 350 °C for 1 h and cooled down. The (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15
precursor solution was prepared by mixing PbI 2
(1.15 M, TCI), PbBr 2
(0.2 M, TCI), FAI (1.05 M, Dyesol), and MABr (0.2 M, Dyesol) in a mixed solvent of DMF : DMSO = 4 : 1 (volume ratio). The precursor solution was spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 10 s and continuously at 5000 rpm for 30 s. During the second step, 100 μL of chlorobenzene was poured on the film at 15 s. Films are post-annealed at 100 °C for 60 min. For the two-step deposition method, PbI 2
(1.3 M) containing 2.5 mol% PbBr 2
was dissolved in 1 mL of DMF and DMSO (ratio = 4 : 1) solution at 80 °C. Then the solution was spin coated on the SnO 2
substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s, and a mixture solution of FAI : MABr : MACl (80 : 10 : 10 mg in 1 mL IPA) was spin coated on the PbI 2
substrate at 5000 rpm for 30 s. Films were annealed at 150 °C for 25 min and 100 °C for 30 min. Finally, spiro-OMeTAD was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 25 s. The 70 mM spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving in chlorobenzene with 4- tert -butylpyridine, Li-TFSI in acetonitrile, and Co[ t -BuPyPz] 3 [TFSI] 3
(FK209, Dyesol) in acetonitrile at a molar ratio of spiro : FK209 : Li-TFSI : TBP of 1 : 0.03 : 0.5 : 3.3. Devices were completed with thermal evaporation of 70 nm thickness gold counter electrodes.
Film characterization
XRD analysis was carried out using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer in an angle range of 2 θ
= 10° to 40°. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were carried out on a ZEISS Merlin at 5 kV, and images were acquired by an in-lens secondary electron detector. Transmission electron microscopy imaging and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis were performed on a FEI Tecnai Osiris at 200 kV. This microscope is equipped with a high brightness X-FEG gun and silicon drift Super-X EDX detectors and Bruker Esprit acquisition software. Samples for TEM imaging were prepared
via
depositing the SnO 2
film on a TEM grid with a carbon support film. The TEM grids were then heat-treated at 180 °C. XPS analysis was done using equipment (a Quantum 2000 system) with an Al Kα X-ray source ( hν : 1487 eV) and a hemispherical electron analyzer. The XPS results provide average chemical information on a spatial area of 100 μm diameter and a depth of 5–10 nm. Absorbance and reflectance were measured with an integrating sphere using UV/vis/NIR spectroscopy (PerkinElmer Lambda 950S). The photoluminescence emission was measured with a fluorescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer LS 55). TGA analysis (TGA 4000 PerkinElmer) was done at a scan rate of 10 °C min −1
from 30 °C to 500 °C. The UPS measurements were performed using a home-made photoemission spectroscopy system, which consists of an ultraviolet source (VUV 5000) and an electron analyzer (SES-100) in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber. A He II source of 40.8 eV, controlled using a monochromator, enables us to obtain precise electronic structures from UPS spectra.
Device measurement
The solar cell measurement was done using an Oriel solar simulator (450 W xenon, AAA class). The light intensity was calibrated with a Si reference cell equipped with an IR-cutoff filter (KG3, Newport), and it was recorded prior to measurement. Current–voltage characteristics of the cells were obtained by applying an external voltage bias while measuring the current response with a digital source meter (Keithley 2400). The voltage scan rate was 100 mV s −1
and no device preconditioning, such as light soaking or forward voltage bias applied for a long time, was applied before starting the measurement. The cells were masked with an active area of 0.16 or 0.89 cm 2
to fix the active area and reduce the influence of the scattered light. The EQE was measured with an IQE200B (Oriel) without bias light.

Abstract Inverted perovskite solar cells have attracted increasing attention because they have achieved long operating lifetimes. However, they have exhibited significantly inferior power conversion efficiencies compared to regular perovskite solar cells. Here we reduce this efficiency gap using a trace amount of surface-anchoring alkylamine ligands (AALs) with different chain lengths as grain and interface modifiers. We show that long-chain AALs added to the precursor solution suppress nonradiative carrier recombination and improve the optoelectronic properties of mixed-cation mixed-halide perovskite films. The resulting AAL surface-modified films exhibit a prominent (100) orientation and lower trap-state density as well as enhanced carrier mobilities and diffusion lengths. These translate into a certified stabilized power conversion efficiency of 22.3% (23.0% power conversion efficiency for lab-measured champion devices). The devices operate for over 1,000 h at the maximum power point under simulated AM1.5 illumination, without loss of efficiency.

Main Metal halide perovskite semiconductors have seen rapid progress in their optoelectronic applications due to their broadly tunable compositions achieved using simple processing approaches 1 , 2 , and in light of their strong light absorption 3 , high charge mobility 4
and long carrier diffusion lengths 5 , 6 , 7 . In photovoltaics (PVs), the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs) started at 3.8% in 2009 and has now reached 25.2% (refs.  1 , 8 ). The highest-efficiency devices use the regular (n–i–p) structure. However, removing ionically doped hole transport materials in inverted (p–i–n) devices has contributed to recent advances in device operating stability 9 . Recently, Bai et al. reported long-term operationally stable inverted PSCs with a PCE loss of less than 5% under continuous simulated AM1.5 irradiation for more than 1,800 h at 70–75 °C in the efficiency dervied from the current density – voltage ( J – V ) relationship 10 . Yang et al. reported inverted PSCs that maintained 97% of the initial efficiency after operation at the maximum power point (MPP) under simulated AM1.5 irradiation for 1,200 h at 65 °C (ref.
11 ). Unfortunately, the PCEs of inverted PSCs lag significantly behind those of regularly structured devices (20.9% vs 25.2%, according to certified records) 8 , 12 , 13 , 14 . Photo-voltage loss due to non-radiative recombination of photogenerated charge carriers is a key factor in the inferior PCEs of inverted PSCs, despite various attempts at addressing this issue 13 , 15 . The photo-voltage of a solar cell depends on the splitting of the electron ( E Fn ) and hole ( E Fp ) quasi-Fermi levels of its photoactive layer. This splitting is a function of the steady-state charge density and the bandgap of the absorber. Nonradiative carrier recombination impairs charge-density buildup and diminishes the device’s photo-voltage. Electronic trap states caused by crystallographic defects including point defects or higher-dimensional defects (such as grain boundaries) are sources of non-radiative charge-carrier recombination; numerous studies have pointed to the critical role of the passivation of point defects and grain boundaries in achieving high-efficiency PSCs 12 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 . These defect sites not only militate against a high photo-voltage, but also shorten the operational lifetime of perovskite devices, as they present a vulnerable initiation site for degradation by extrinsic environmental species 21 , 22 , 23 . Here we demonstrate the use of long AALs with an optimized alkyl-chain length as grain and interface modifiers to improve optoelectronic properties by promoting favourable grain orientation and suppressing trap-state density. These augmented film properties enable the demonstration of a record certified PCE of >22.3% (23.0% PCE for lab-measured champion devices) for inverted-structured devices. The devices show no PCE loss after 1,000 h of operation at the MPP under simulated AM1.5 illumination. Optical and structural properties of AAL-treated perovskites AALs have a long alkyl hydrophobic chain as well as an amine group capable of anchoring to the A-site of perovskites. Molecules with an amine group have been implicated in promoting specific facets for perovskite films and single crystals 24 , 25 , and also filling point defects (A-site vacancies can potentially be filled by amine groups) 26 , 27 . After the self-assembly of AALs in the perovskite matrix, the molecular modified perovskite interfaces are composed of densely packed ligands that are stabilized by van der Waals interactions between hydrophobic organic moieties of the ligands. Such van der Waals interactions become stronger with increasing alkyl-chain length 28 . This thin insulating layer (quantum tunnelling layer) on the surfaces and grain boundaries suppresses nonradiative charge-carrier recombination 19 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31
and acts as an ion migration barrier 32 , 33 . The alkyl-chain length influences the ligand packing density, ligand desorption energy, carrier dynamics and ion migration, and eventually impacts the device efficiency and stability 28 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 . Therefore, as a proof-of-concept, we first studied the influence of AALs with different alkyl-chain lengths, namely
n -butylamine (BA), phenethylamine (PEA), octylamine (OA) and oleylamine (OAm), on the perovskite film quality. In contrast with procedures that are meant to generate a 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure, we only introduced a trace amount of AALs, <0.3 mol.%. Over 5 mol.% large A-site cations is typically required to form 2D/3D heterostructures 19 , 39 , 40 , 41 . Cs 0.05 (FA 0.92 MA 0.08 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.92 Br 0.08 ) 3
(referred to as CsFAMA; FA, formamidinium; MA, methylammonium) was used as the baseline perovskite composition. The AALs (0.1 wt%) were directly added into the perovskite precursor, and the perovskite films were fabricated using a one-step anti-solvent crystallization approach 42 . We first used time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL; Fig.
1a ) to roughly assess the perovskite films’ quality after introducing AALs with different alkyl-chain lengths. The perovskite films with long-alkyl-chain AALs (OA or OAm) exhibit carrier lifetimes ( τ ) that are much longer (OA,
τ  = 789 ns; OAm,
τ  = 1,049 ns) than those of pristine films ( τ  = 114 ns) and of films with short-alkyl-chain AALs (BA,
τ  = 195 ns; PEA,
τ  = 265 ns). This indicates that the carrier nonradiative recombination was significantly suppressed upon the introduction of a trace amount of long-alkyl-chain AALs.

shows the water contact angles of perovskite films with AALs of different alkyl-chain lengths (0.1 wt%). The water contact angle for the pristine film is 60°, and it increased to 63° and 71° for the perovskite films with BA and PEA, respectively, which are short-alkyl-chain AALs. By contrast, the perovskite films with long-alkyl-chain AALs exhibited much larger water contact angles: 88° and 98° for the perovskite films with OA and OAm, respectively. This observation indicates that the long-alkyl-chain AALs assembled on the perovskite film surface, thus dramatically enhancing the hydrophobicity of the films. The water contact angles (Supplementary Fig.
2 ) for the perovskite films with 0.05 wt% and 0.2 wt% AALs are 97° and 100°, respectively, suggesting a similar coverage of anchoring AAL molecules after anti-solvent washing. The distinct improvement of film quality motivated us to investigate the unique role of the trace amount of long-alkyl-chain AALs. For the rest of the discussion, AAL refers to OAm unless otherwise noted. Figure
1d,e
shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of CsFAMA films without and with the introduction of AALs. The films with AALs show a similar grain size to that of pristine films. The SEM image cross-section (Fig.
1f ) shows a 750-nm-thick, highly crystalline perovskite absorber layer with a single grain throughout the thickness of the film. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD; Fig.
1c ) patterns show a notably increased ratio of the (100) plane to the other crystal planes’ peaks ((110), (111), (210) and (211)) in the films with AALs, which indicates that the (100) grains grew faster by consuming neighbouring, randomly oriented grains. Since powder XRD conveys information primarily from the film’s bulk, we also used grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS; Fig.
1g,h
and Supplementary Fig.
3 ) to study the surface of the perovskite films. GIWAXS analysis of the films confirmed that the promotion of (100) occurred while other random orientations were suppressed; moreover, no signal that could be attributable to a 2D component was detected. In reported 2D/3D perovskites, 2D perovskite platelets can be observed in SEM images and a clearly detectable 2D component signal appears in GIWAXS 19 , 43 . However, we did not observe evidence of a 2D component formation from either SEM images or GIWAXS upon the introduction of trace amounts of AALs, which indicates that 2D perovskite is effectively absent from our films. The absorption of the CsFAMA films is unaltered by the introduction of AALs (Supplementary Fig.
4 ). The Tauc plot from the ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) absorption spectra shows an optical bandgap of 1.56 eV for CsFAMA films. The steady photoluminescence (PL; Supplementary Fig.
5 ) intensity was significantly increased for films with AALs, indicating that the population of non-radiative recombination centres in the perovskite films was reduced. PL mapping confirmed the uniformly enhanced PL intensity as shown in Supplementary Fig.
6 . We hypothesized that a suppressed trap-state density and promoted (100) grain orientation resultant from the use of AALs may influence carrier transport in the perovskite films. We conducted contactless measurements of the photocarrier transport properties of CsMAFA-8 films, in which [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) was used to induce the interfacial PL quenching 44 , 45 , as shown in Fig.
1b . TRPL decay measurements show that the carrier lifetime without the quencher ( τ ) increased from 290 ns for the pristine films to 520 ns for the films with AALs. The quench-limited diffusion time ( τ q ) was 80 and 50 ns for the pristine films and the films with AALs, respectively. From the equation 45
\(L_{\mathrm{D}} \approx \frac{{2L}}{\uppi }\sqrt {2\left( {\frac{\tau }{{\tau _{\mathrm{q}}}} - 1} \right)}\) , where
L D
and
L
stand for diffusion length and film thickness (~750 nm), respectively, we estimate a diffusion length of ~1 μm and ~2 μm for the pristine film and the film with AALs, respectively. Combining the relation
\(L_D = \sqrt {D \times \tau }\)
and the Einstein relation
D   =   μ  ×  k B  ×  T / q , where
μ ,
k B ,
T
and
q
stand for mobility, Boltzmann’s constant, temperature and elementary charge, respectively, we extracted a carrier mobility of 1.6 and 3 cm 2  V −1  s −1
for pristine films and films with AALs, respectively. Thus, CsMAFA-8 films containing AALs exhibited noticeably longer diffusion lengths and higher carrier mobilities than pristine films. PV performance of AAL-treated perovskites The improved carrier transport in AAL-treated films motivated us to investigate whether this enhancement in basic properties could be translated into improvements in device PCE, particularly through gains in photo-voltage. We fabricated PSCs based on CsFAMA films. As shown in Fig.
2a , the p–i–n planar heterojunction devices were structured as indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate/poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA)/perovskite/fullerene (C 60 )/bathocuproine (BCP)/copper.

shows the typical
J – V
characteristics of CsFAMA devices with AALs of different alkyl-chain lengths. The pristine devices show a typical PCE of 20.5% with a short-circuit current density ( J SC ) of 24.2 mA cm −2 , an open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 1.06 V and a fill factor (FF) of 80%. The performance of the CsFAMA devices with short-alkyl-chain AALs (BA or PEA) slightly improved to 20.8% (BA) and 20.9% (PEA), benefiting from ~30 mV
V OC
enhancement. The PEA-concentration-dependent
J – V
characteristics of CsFAMA devices with PEA are shown in Supplementary Fig.
7 . The champion device with PEA shows a
V OC
and PCE of 1.15 V and 21.3%, respectively. By contrast, the devices with long-alkyl-chain AALs (OA or OAm) show a remarkably enhanced PCE, resulting from a strong
V OC
improvement up to 110 mV. The devices with OAm show an average PCE around 22.0% with a
J SC
of 24.1 mA cm −2 , a
V OC
of 1.17 V and an FF of 78.2%. The champion devices with OAm deliver a PCE of 23% with a
J SC
of 24.1 mA cm −2 , a
V OC
of 1.17 V and an FF of 81.6%, as shown in Fig.
2c . The statistical PCE values from 100 devices (50 pristine devices and 50 devices with AALs; Fig.
2e ) demonstrate the reproducibility of the performance enhancement associated with the use of AALs. The PCEs of the devices with OA are similar to those of the devices containing OAm, confirming the advantage of using long-alkyl-chain AALs over AALs with short chains. This is also in accordance with the trend of film quality as deduced from TRPL. The voltage deficit is defined by ( E g /q ) −  V OC , where
E g
is the optical bandgap. Since the optical bandgap is 1.56 eV, the voltage deficit is only 0.39 V for devices based on long-alkyl-chain AALs. When fine-tuning the concentration of long-alkyl-chain AALs from 0.05 wt% to 0.2 wt%, we did not observe an appreciable variation in device performance (Supplementary Fig.
8 ). Further increasing the AAL concentration to 0.4 wt% leads to a severe PCE drop. Unencapsulated CsFAMA devices with AALs were certified at an accredited laboratory (Newport Photovoltaic Testing and Calibration Laboratory). The PCE certification protocol uses a quasi-steady-state (QSS)
I – V
sweep, instead of the normally used forward and reverse
I – V
scans, to ascertain a device’s PV characteristics. Ten voltage points were collected in the QSS measurement, with each bias voltage applied and held until the measured current stabilized (Supplementary Fig.
9 ). The devices show a certified stabilized PCE of 22.34% with a
J SC
of 23.9 mA cm −2 , a
V OC
of 1.14 V and an FF of 82%, representing a record PCE for p–i–n-structured devices. The certified QSS
I – V
curve and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in Supplementary Fig.
10 . To identify the major factors responsible for the efficiency enhancement, we started by comparing the morphology (by top-view and cross-sectional SEM images) of the pristine perovskite films and the films with AALs (Supplementary Fig.
11 ). Both the pristine perovskite films and the films with AALs are compact with similar grain sizes. The full width at half maximum values of the (100) XRD peaks of pristine films and of films with AALs are 0.09° and 0.10°, respectively; that is, they are nearly identical. We can therefore rule out a major influence of perovskite grain size and crystallinity in this study. To investigate the influence of surface passivation while avoiding effects related to perovskite film orientation, we subjected ready-formed pristine perovskite films to a post-treatment using AALs with alkyl chains of various lengths (BA, PEA and OAm). XRD patterns (Supplementary Fig.
12a ) show that the films post-treated with AALs of different lengths had similar orientations to the pristine films. We then fabricated the devices based on these films with similar orientations. The devices with post-treatment surface passivation enabled by AALs show higher PCE values than the pristine devices, and the long-chain AALs show better passivation, something we assign to stronger hole blocking at the interfaces between perovskite and C 60
(Supplementary Fig.
12b ) 31 . The
V OC
and PCE of the devices with long-chain AALs increased to 1.12 V and 21.1%, respectively, post-treatment. However, in contrast with the devices fabricated by adding AALs into the precursor ( V OC
of 1.17 V and PCE of >22%), the
V OC
and PCE of devices with AAL surface passivation are still lower, indicating that surface passivation alone does not fully explain the performance improvement, and that tuning the orientation of the perovskite films plays a crucial role. We conclude that the combined effect of both surface passivation and orientation tuning leads to the dramatically improved
V OC
and PCE for the devices with AALs (mixed in the precursor). This result is rationalized by the facet dependence of the surface-defect density, and it highlights the crucial role of controlling the film orientation. Mechanisms underpinning efficiency enhancements We sought to evaluate whether changes in surface roughness had a significant role in improving the device efficiency. Atomic force microscopy images revealed that the roughness of films was reduced from 17.5 nm to 12.1 nm by introducing AALs (Supplementary Fig.
13 ), which suggests that changes in the interfacial roughness were not a major variable affecting the device performance. To further elucidate the trap-state distributions and energies that are affected by the AAL treatment, we investigated trap-state profiles using thermal admittance spectroscopy. We acquired temperature-dependent capacitance versus frequency ( C–f ) plots to probe trap density and the energy depth of trap states (Fig.
3a
and Supplementary Fig.
14 ). Figure
3b
shows trap density profiles at different temperatures, deduced from the temperature-dependent
C – f
plots. At all temperatures from 280 to 320 K, the devices with AALs show a similar trap-state density at energies between 0.25 and 0.32 eV and a lower trap-state density across the higher-energy region from 0.32 to 0.4 eV. At room temperature (300 K), pristine devices show a peak trap density of 1 × 10 23  m −3  eV −1
at 0.35 eV; by contrast, the devices with AALs show a smaller peak intensity of 4.4 × 10 22  m −3  eV −1
at shallower energy (0.32 eV). The pristine devices show a trap-state density that is as much as approximately four times higher in the deeper energy region from 0.32–0.4 eV. Fig. 3: Defect density and energy-level characterization of perovskite films with AALs. a , Temperature-dependent

Helium Iα ( hν  = 21.22 eV) spectra of secondary electron cut-off (left panel) and UPS spectra in the valence band (VB) region (right panel) are shown. The inset shows the enlarged UPS spectra in the VB region, and the intercept indicates the distance of the VBM with respect to
E F , which was noted as
E B, min . The intercept in the secondary electron cut-off (left panel) shows
E B, max , and the WF was obtained by
hν  −  E B, max . The VBM was obtained by
hν  − ( E B, max  −  E B, min ). The position of the CBM with respect to the VBM was defined by the optical bandgap (1.56 eV).
d , Energy-level scheme for the pristine CsFAMA film and the film with AALs based on the parameters derived from UPS spectra. Full size image We further measured the electroluminescence (EL) spectra of solar cells operating as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), as shown in Supplementary Fig.
15 . The devices with AALs deliver an EQE EL
of 0.65% under an injection current around
J SC . In comparison, the pristine devices show an EQE EL
of 0.07% under the same injection current. The
V OC
improvement, Δ V OC , estimated by Δ V OC  = ( k B T / q ) × ln(EQE AALs /EQE pristine ) is ~60 mV. To further test the carrier lifetime in fully operating devices, transient photo-voltage decay measurements were conducted. As seen in Fig.
2d , the carrier lifetime ( τ ) increased from 0.67 μs to 1.5 μs after introducing AALs. Light-intensity-dependent
V OC
was measured and the diode ideal factor ( n ) was derived, as shown in Supplementary Fig.
16 . When purely radiative recombination is present,
n
equals 1. The devices with AALs show
n
closer to 1 compared with the pristine devices, arising from the suppressed nonradiative recombination achieved by AALs. AALs have the potential to suppress trap density directly by filling in A-site vacancies and modifying grains and interfaces. Additionally, they have the potential to provide a similar benefit by promoting the (100) orientation of grains in perovskite films 46 , which may have a different susceptibility to surface-defect formation than other random orientations in the pristine perovskite films 47 , 48 . To further investigate this possibility, we studied the dependence of trap density on the surface crystallographic facets using density functional theory (DFT) calculations based on a cubic FAPbI 3
model 49 , 50 . The corresponding slabs exposing the (100), (110), (111), (210) and (211) surfaces were considered. From the projected density of states (PDOS) of all the slabs, as shown in Fig.
4
and Supplementary Figs.
17
and
18 , we find that the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) are mainly composed of I-5 p , Pb-6 s
and Pb-6 p
orbitals. According to these modelling results, some surfaces are less benign than others; the (110) (Fig.
4c ), (111) (Fig.
4d ) and (211) (Fig.
4e,f ) surfaces show trap states that are more likely to adversely affect device performance. However, there are no trap states that appear for the (100) surface in either FAI-rich or PbI 2 -rich termination cases (Fig.
4a,b ). Thus, it can be concluded that the (110), (111) and (211) surfaces would introduce additional trap states, while in the case of the (100) surface, the delocalized electronic distributions of the VBM and the CBM are retained in a similar configuration to that of bulk FAPbI 3 . Fig. 4: DFT calculation of the trap states on the surface of various crystallographic facets. a – f , Optimized crystal structures (left panel) and PDOS (right panel) with contributions from FA (blue), I (purple) and Pb (dark grey) of cubic-phase FAPbI 3
slabs with surface facets: FAI-rich (100) ( a ), PbI 2 -rich (100) ( b ), PbI 2 -rich (110) ( c ), FAPbI 3
(111) ( d ), FAI-rich (211) ( e ) and PbI 2 -rich (211) ( f ) calculated by DFT. The trap states are marked with orange. The two straight grey lines in the crystal structure define the unit slab. The VBM is set at zero energy with a horizontal grey dashed line as a guide. Full size image The electronic structure of films with AALs was investigated by work function (WF) and VBM measurements using UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS; Fig.
3c ). The WF was determined from the secondary electron cut-off, and we observed a change in WF from 4.58 to 4.41 eV after AAL modification. The VBMs were located at 1.1 and 1.3 eV below the Fermi level ( E F ) for pristine films and AAL-modified films, respectively. The energy-level diagrams for the films based on the UPS and optical absorption measurement are shown in Fig.
3d . The VBM and CBM of AAL-modified films are nearly identical to those of pristine films; however, the WF shifts by about 170 meV towards the vacuum level ( E VAC ), and the
E F
shifts by 200 meV towards the CBM, indicating that the AAL-modified films become more n-type, which is likely attributable to the change of the surface termination after AAL modification 51 . Perovskite films that are more n-type have a larger number of filled electron traps, which are the predominant trap species 13 , 52 , and this can lead to a further decrease in trap-assisted recombination events 13 . Moreover, perovskite films that are more n-type enable more efficient charge transfer between the perovskite and the electron transport material (C 60 ) 51 , 53 . We summarized the likely mechanisms behind the device efficiency enhancement in Fig.
5 . The long-chain AALs assemble on the perovskite grains, restricting the grains’ tilt during growth and eventually resulting in a (100)-orientation-dominant film that is of lower defect density than a randomly oriented film (Fig.
5a,b ). As the growth proceeds, the long-chain AALs are finally expelled to the perovskite film surface, as indicated by water-contact-angle measurements. The ligand layer on the perovskite film’s surface provides effective surface passivation because a long-chain AAL layer enables strong hole blocking between the perovskite and C 60
interfaces (Fig.
5c,d ) 31 . Fig. 5: Schematic illustration of the likely mechanisms underpinning efficiency enhancements. a , b , Illustration of the influence of the short-chain AALs ( a ) and long-chain AALs ( b ) on the crystallization of the perovskite films.

interfaces ( d ). HOMO and LUMO stand for highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, respectively. Full size image Impact of AALs on device stability Suppressing defects and performing molecular modification on perovskite grains and interfaces may have the additional effect of reducing ion migration, which is an unwanted effect in PSCs that contributes to hysteresis and low stability. We studied ion migration using temperature-dependent transient response measurements 54 , 55 . The ions were driven by an external bias to the electrode interface, after which this external bias was abruptly removed. A negative current can be seen due to the quick backward movement of the ion vacancies, forced by the concentration gradient (Supplementary Fig.
19 ). The decay rate (1/ τ ) of the negative current reflects the ion distribution recovery time, and it was used to deduce the activation energy ( E a ) of ion migration according to the following equation: $${\mathrm{ln}}\left( {{\mathrm{T}}/\tau } \right) = C - \frac{{E_{\mathrm{a}}}}{{k_{\mathrm{B}}T}}$$ where
T
is the temperature,
C
is a constant and
k B
is Boltzmann’s constant. The typical temperature-dependent transient response measurements for CsFAMA devices with AALs are shown in Supplementary Fig.
20 . By fitting ln( T / τ ) versus 1/ T , we estimate an
E a
of 243 meV and 422 meV for pristine films and films with AALs, respectively (Fig.
6a ), indicating that ion migration is more hindered in the films with AALs. Fig. 6: Ion migration and long-term device stability. a , Arrhenius plots (obtained by linear fitting of data points) of the temperature dependence of
T / τ , showing an ion migration activation energy ( E a ) of 243 meV and 422 meV for pristine films and films with AALs, respectively. Note that 1/ τ
is the decay rate (s −1 ).
b , Thermal stability of devices at a fixed temperature of 85 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere. The data points (colour-filled dots) were collected by measuring the
J – V
curves of the samples at different time intervals. The initial PCEs are about 17% for the pristine CsFAMA device and 18% for the CsFAMA device with AALs.
c , Plot showing 1,000 h of continuous MPP tracking for the pristine CsFAMA device and the CsFAMA device with AALs under constant simulated solar illumination (100 mW cm −2 ) in a nitrogen atmosphere with a UV filter with a 420-nm cut-off. The initial PCEs are about 19.2% for the pristine CsFAMA device and 21.2% for the CsFAMA device with AALs. Full size image Having shown that processing perovskite films with AALs leads to superior transport properties, and inverted PSCs with record PCEs, we sought to ascertain whether this processing strategy might compromise the operational stability of devices. To study the long-term stability of the perovskite photoactive layer, we conducted MPP tracking on encapsulated CsMAFA-8 devices under constant simulated AM1.5 illumination (100 mW cm −2 ), as shown in Fig.
6c . Pristine devices rapidly lost 42% of their initial PCE after 350 h of testing, while the devices with AALs exhibited no PCE loss after continuous operation for 1,000 h under AM1.5 illumination. The starting device PCE was 21.2% and the final PCE after the MPP test was 21.6%. We also investigated the thermal stability by collecting
J – V
curves at various times for devices maintained at a fixed temperature of 85 °C. The pristine devices lost ~39% of their initial PCE while the devices with AALs lost only around 10% of their initial PCE after a thermal stability test of ~1,020 h (Fig.
6b ). A reduction in defect density and ion migration likely benefited device stability 11 , 15 . Conclusions In summary, we have demonstrated the role of AALs, particularly long-alkyl-chain AALs, in improving optoelectronic properties by promoting favourable grain orientations and suppressing trap-state density. Our strategy based on long-alkyl-chain AALs enabled us to demonstrate p–i–n-structured devices with >23.0% efficiency (22.3% certified) and good operational stability. The molecular modification of perovskite grains and interfaces is crucial to enhance both the efficiency and stability of PSCs. Our findings also indicated that anisotropic electronic properties of the perovskite facets make management of films’ crystal orientations an important path towards high-efficiency PSCs. Further understanding of the nature of the different surface facets in polycrystalline perovskite, including the defect type and concentration, will likely be essential for the future of perovskite devices. Methods Materials Unless otherwise stated, all materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Alfa Aesar and used as received. Perovskite films and devices were fabricated using PbI 2
(10-mesh beads, ultra dry, 99.999% purity) purchased from Alfa Aesar, organic halide salts purchased from GreatCell Solar and caesium iodide (99.999% purity) purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA) was purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology. The C 60
was purchase from Nano-C. The bathocuproine (BCP; sublimed grade, 99.99% purity) and all the anhydrous solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Perovskite film preparation and device fabrication The patterned ITO/glass substrates were sequentially cleaned with soap, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol under ultrasonication. The ITO/glass substrates were then dried with N 2
blowing and treated with UV ozone for 15 min. The perovskite films were fabricated by the anti-solvent crystallization approach in a N 2
glove box. In a typical procedure, a hole transport layer of
∼ 10 nm thickness made of PTAA with a concentration of 2 mg ml –1
dissolved in toluene was spin coated at a speed of 6,000 r.p.m for 35 s and then annealed at 100 °C for 15 min. The perovskite precursor solution (1.4 M) composed of mixed cations (Pb, Cs, FA and MA) and halides (I and Br) was dissolved in mixed solvent (DMF/DMSO = 4/1) according to a formula of Cs 0.05 (FA 0.92 MA 0.08 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.92 Br 0.08 ) 3 . A trace amount (0.1 wt%) of alkylammonium ligands (BA, PEA, OA and OAm) was added into the precursor solution. A two-step spin-coating procedure with 2,000 r.p.m. for 10 s and 4,000 r.p.m. for 50 s was adopted for the preparation of perovskite films. Chlorobenzene (150 µl) was dropped on the spinning substrate during the 45 s of the second spin-coating step. Subsequently, the sample was annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. The devices with an area of 10 mm 2
were finished by thermally evaporating C 60
(20 nm), BCP (3 nm) and Cu (80 nm) in sequential order by using a thin-film deposition system from Angstrom Engineering under high vacuum. For the device thermal stability test, a 10-nm layer of SnO 2
and a 120-nm layer of indium zinc oxide were deposited on top of the C 60
in sequential order, by atomic layer deposition and sputtering, respectively, to replace BCP and Cu. Perovskite film characterizations The SEM images were taken by a Helios G4 UX dual-beam scanning electron microscope. XRD patterns were measured with a Bruker AXS D8 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation ( λ  = 1.54178 Å). The absorption spectra were obtained by a Cary 6000i UV–Vis–near-infrared spectrophotometer. The roughness was measured by an atomic force microscope (Bruker Dimension Icon with ScanAsyst). PL measurements were performed using a Horiba Fluorolog Time Correlated Single Photon Counting system with photomultiplier tube detectors. The excitation source was a pulsed laser diode at a wavelength of 504 nm. The water contact angle was measured by Drop Shape Analyzer DSA100 from KRUSS with uniform LED illumination and high-quality optics to ensure high precision when displaying the drop, to accurately measure the contact angle. GIWAXS measurements were carried out at beamline 7.3.3 of the Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Samples were measured at a detector distance of 0.249 m using an X-ray wavelength of 1.240 Å, at a 0.24° angle of incidence with respect to the substrate plane. Scattering intensity was detected by a PILATUS 2M detector. Device characterizations Simulated AM1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm –2 ) was produced by a xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (Abet Technologies Sun 3000 Class AAA Solar Simulator) for
J – V
measurements. The light intensity was calibrated by a calibrated reference cell with a Schott visible-colour glass filter (KG5 colour filter) from Newport. A Keithley 2400 SourceMeter was used for driving the
J – V
measurement. The devices were measured immediately after fabrication without any preconditioning. They were measured with a metal aperture with an area of 6.69 mm 2
(certified by Newport) to accurately define the active area. A voltage scan was measured from 1.3 V to −0.3 V with a scanning rate of 0.1 V s −1 , and a voltage step of 10 mV was used. The devices were measured in both a nitrogen atmosphere (at KAUST) and ambient air (humidity of 30–60%; at University of Toronto) and no obvious difference was observed. To further confirm the PV parameters, the devices were measured by an independent accredited laboratory (Newport). A QSS
I – V
sweep protocol was used to remove the influence from the hysteresis. For the QSS
I – V
sweep conducted by Newport, ten voltage points were collected in the QSS measurement, and each bias voltage was applied and held until the measured current was determined to be unchanging. The
J SC
and PCE measured by Newport were similar to the results in the lab. The EQE was measured by Newport, and the integrated
J SC
was carefully checked and matched well with the
J SC
from the
I – V
sweep before they would provide the certificate. For the transient photo-voltage measurements, the device was serially connected to a digital oscilloscope for monitoring the charge-density decay for the device in approximately the
V OC
condition. An attenuated 405-nm laser diode was used as a small perturbation to the background illumination on the device. The laser-pulse-induced photo-voltage variation (Δ V ) and the
V OC
were produced by the background illumination. The intensity of the short (50 ns) laser pulse was adjusted to keep the voltage perturbation below 10 mV, typically at 5 mV. A Keithley 2400 sourcemeter and a fibre integrating sphere (FOIS-1) coupled with a QE Pro spectrometer (Ocean Optics) were used for the measurements of the LED devices. Trap density measurements by thermal admittance spectroscopy A sinusoidal voltage ( V peak-to-peak  = 30 mV) generated from a function generator (Tektronix AFG 3000) was applied to the device. The current signal of the devices was analysed using a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research Systems, SR830) after being amplified through a low-noise-current preamplifier (Stanford Research Systems, SR570). The capacitance of the device was calculated based on the parallel equivalent circuit model with the amplitude and phase of the current signal obtained from the lock-in amplifier. The capacitance spectra of the device were measured by scanning the frequency of the sinusoidal voltage from 0.01 to 100 kHz in logarithmic steps. The temperature of the device was controlled using a closed-cycle cryocooler (Advanced Research Systems, DE202AE). The capacitance–voltage curve was obtained by measuring the capacitance as the applied DC bias voltage was scanned from −0.2 to 1.5 V. Based on the capacitance spectra measured at different temperatures, the trap density distribution in energy ( E ω ) was calculated with the following equations: $$N_T\left( {E_\omega } \right) = - \frac{{V_{{\mathrm{bi}}}}}{{qW}}\frac{{{\mathrm{d}}C}}{{{\mathrm{d}}\omega }}\frac{{\omega }}{{{\mathrm{k}}_{\mathrm{B}}T}}$$
(1)
$$E_\omega = k_{\mathrm{B}}T{\mathrm{ln}}\left( {\frac{{\omega _0}}{\omega }} \right) = k_{\mathrm{B}}T{\mathrm{ln}}\left( {\frac{{2\uppi \nu _0T^2}}{\omega }} \right)$$

Ion migration measurement To measure the ion migration activation energy, two symmetric Au electrodes were deposited on the perovskite films to form a symmetric Au/perovskite/Au device. The electrode width is 2 mm and the channel length is 50 µm. A bias voltage of 3 V was first applied to the electrodes by a source meter (Keithley 2400) for about 16 s to induce the ion migration. Then a negative current induced by the ion vacancies’ redistribution could be measured after the voltage was suddenly removed. The negative current then exponentially recovered to zero. The decay time of the negative current contains the information of the ionic transport dynamics. The measurement was carried out when the temperature of the device was controlled from 280 to 325 K using a DE202AE closed-cycle cryocooler (Advanced Research Systems). Then the negative current curves were fitted with a double-exponential function. The slower decay time constants
τ , which represent the ion distribution recovery time, were used to deduce the activation energy of the ion migration. Computational methods The DFT calculations were performed with the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method as implemented in the VASP code. The generalized gradient approximation Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation functional was used. A uniform grid of 6 × 6 × 6 k-mesh in the Brillouin zone was employed to optimize the crystal structures of cubic-phase FAPbI 3 . We considered FAPbI 3
slabs exposing different surfaces; all the slabs were separated by both top and bottom vacuum layers ( ∼ 10 Å) to prevent spurious inter-slab interactions. The Brillouin zone was sampled by a 2 × 2 × 1 k-mesh for FAPbI 3
slabs. The plane-wave basis set cut-offs of the wavefunctions were set at 500 eV for bulk crystals and 450 eV for supercells at the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)/PBE level. The atomic positions of all supercells with and without defects were fully relaxed until the supercells had Hellman–Feynman forces on each atom of less than 0.01 eV Å –1 . Device stability measurement The operational stability tests were carried out at the MPP for the encapsulated devices under UV-filtered AM1.5 illumination (100 mW cm −2 , with a UV filter with a 420-nm cut-off). The devices were tested in a chamber with a constant nitrogen supply, which also ensured a stable device temperature of ~40 °C (the chamber itself was in ambient air). The voltage at the MPP was calculated and applied automatically; the current output of the device was tracked. The devices were encapsulated in a nitrogen glovebox. UV-curable epoxy was coated around the device area, and a glass cover slide was attached to enclose the area. The encapsulation was then finished off by exposing the construct to UV light for 10 min. The thermal stability assessment of solar cells was carried out by repeating the
J – V
test over various times for the devices heated at a fixed temperature of 85 °C. Reporting Summary Further information on research design is available in the

Energy Energy harvesting Solar cells Solar energy and photovoltaic technology
Abstract Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are an emerging photovoltaic technology with the potential to disrupt the mature silicon solar cell market. Great improvements in device performance over the past few years, thanks to the development of fabrication protocols 1 , 2 , 3 , chemical compositions 4 , 5
and phase stabilization methods 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , have made PSCs one of the most efficient and low-cost solution-processable photovoltaic technologies. However, the light-harvesting performance of these devices is still limited by excessive charge carrier recombination. Despite much effort, the performance of the best-performing PSCs is capped by relatively low fill factors and high open-circuit voltage deficits (the radiative open-circuit voltage limit minus the high open-circuit voltage) 11 . Improvements in charge carrier management, which is closely tied to the fill factor and the open-circuit voltage, thus provide a path towards increasing the device performance of PSCs, and reaching their theoretical efficiency limit 12 . Here we report a holistic approach to improving the performance of PSCs through enhanced charge carrier management. First, we develop an electron transport layer with an ideal film coverage, thickness and composition by tuning the chemical bath deposition of tin dioxide (SnO 2 ). Second, we decouple the passivation strategy between the bulk and the interface, leading to improved properties, while minimizing the bandgap penalty. In forward bias, our devices exhibit an electroluminescence external quantum efficiency of up to 17.2 per cent and an electroluminescence energy conversion efficiency of up to 21.6 per cent. As solar cells, they achieve a certified power conversion efficiency of 25.2 per cent, corresponding to 80.5 per cent of the thermodynamic limit of its bandgap.

Main SnO 2 -based electron transport layers (ETLs) offer favourable band alignment, while being processable at low temperature 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 . Of the various deposition methods, SnO 2
nanoparticle-based ETLs have demonstrated the best performances thus far. However, SnO 2
nanoparticle-based PSCs exhibit relatively low electroluminescence external quantum efficiency (EQE) values, and hence higher open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) deficits (defined as the radiative
V OC
limit minus the high
V OC ), compared to TiO 2 -based PSCs 8 , in spite of efforts to eliminate non-radiative recombination pathways 19 . The electroluminescence EQE of a photovoltaic device, determined by measuring the luminescence efficiency under forward bias, is a direct measure of the radiative efficiency of carrier recombination. The electroluminescence EQE can be used to quantify the non-radiative contribution to the
V OC
deficit via the reciprocity theorem, and is a useful metric for solar cell characterization 11 , 20 . Thus, it is crucial to develop strategies that minimize photovoltage losses at the ETL/perovskite interface so as to minimize the
V OC
deficit, encouraging the search for a different deposition method that can develop the full potential of SnO 2
ETLs. The ideal SnO 2
ETL will generate a high photovoltage and fill factor by having complete and conformal coverage without pinholes, an ideal band alignment to efficiently extract electrons while blocking hole back-transfer, a low defect density to prevent detrimental interface recombinations, and will also be thin enough to promote efficient charge extraction 21 . As a part of our holistic approach, we first report a facile method of chemically tuning the physical and electronic properties of the SnO 2
ETL via chemical bath deposition. Chemical bath deposition enables uniform and complete coverage of the underlying substrate by depositing a dense and conformal layer 22 , 23 . However, a lack of understanding of the complex chemical reactions during SnO 2
chemical bath deposition has prevented the fabrication of highly efficient PSCs. We infer that the Sn intermediate species during chemical bath deposition play a crucial part in the quality and the characteristics of the final SnO 2
layer. More specifically, we suggest that the formation of various Sn intermediate species depends on the decomposition pathway of the Sn 2+
precursor (SnCl 2 ), which depends on the pH of the reaction solution 24 , 25 , 26 . Synthesis and characterization of SnO 2
Freshly prepared chemical bath deposition solutions exhibit pH <1 and the pH increases with longer reaction time as urea decomposes and releases OH –
(Supplementary Fig.
1 ). We divide the changes in the thin film properties of the SnO 2
layer with reaction time into two main stages as shown in Fig.
1 . Stage A shows the growth of SnO 2
layer with planar morphologies. Within stage A, stage A-i at early reaction times is the most acidic (pH 1), followed by stage A-ii (pH 1.5) and stage A-iii (pH 3). Stage B is the final stage of the reaction with a distinct morphology of interconnected nanorods and has the highest pH of 6.

shows scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the SnO 2
layer deposited on top of a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-covered glass via chemical bath deposition. The top-right insets are magnified top-down SEM images, highlighting the roughness and surface morphology of the film, with the SnO 2
layer more clearly seen on top of a pyramid-shaped FTO domain. The insets on the bottom-right are cross-section transmission electron microscope (TEM) images. In the early stage of the reaction (stage A-i), which is when the pH of the reaction solution is still approximately 1, the SnO 2
layer is about 20 nm thick, conformal with the underlying FTO layer. With increasing reaction time, and thus an increase in the pH of the reaction solution, the size of the SnO 2
domain increases while forming a densely packed layer with thicknesses ranging from around 50 nm to around 100 nm (Fig.
1b, c ). When the reaction reaches stage B, the SnO 2
begins to grow into elongated rod-like morphologies (Fig.
1d ). The high-resolution TEM shown in Fig.
1b
(stage A-ii) shows a SnO 2
layer forming complete coverage with interconnected domains, even down to the sharp valleys within the FTO layer (Fig.
1e ). The conformal and complete SnO 2
coverage is further confirmed by cyclic voltammetry, which shows that the films have robust hole-blocking capabilities when reacted past stage A-ii, or pH 1.5 (Supplementary Fig.
2 ), whereas stage A-i SnO 2
is inefficient at hole blocking. The lattice fringes in Fig.
1f
indicate that individual domains have high crystallinity, where the lattice fringes correspond to the (110) and (101) planes of rutile SnO 2 , with the fast Fourier transform pattern of the TEM image shown in the inset to Fig. 1f.The films prepared while still under acidic conditions (stages A-i, A-ii and A-iii) have a pure phase, whereas films prepared by allowing the reaction solution to reach stage B contain secondary phases, such as Sn 6 O 4 (OH) 4
and SnO (Fig.
1g ). SnO 2
synthesis mechanism From the experimental results, we classify the reaction progress into four parts (Fig.
1h ). At the beginning of the reaction (stages A-i and A-ii, pH = 1−1.5), the dominant product of the chemical bath deposition reaction is SnO 2.
As the reaction progresses to stage A-iii, owing to a sharp decrease in oxygen dissolved in the reaction solution, incomplete oxidation of Sn 2+
to Sn 4+
is highly likely (Supplementary Fig.
3 ). This leads to dominant production of SnO 2– x , 0< x <2
(ref.
24 ). In addition, the chemical bath deposition solution turns murky around this reaction stage, owing to the formation of insoluble amorphous tin oxide species (inset in Fig.
1h ) 24 . When the reaction reaches stage B, oxygen-deficient SnO 2– x
is joined by Sn 6 O 4 (OH) 4
and SnO, which are produced as secondary phases (red precipitate shown in the inset), as observed from the X-ray diffraction data (Fig.
1g
and Supplementary Fig.
4 ). We propose a synthesis mechanism during the chemical bath deposition growth of SnO 2
in Fig.
1i . In stage A, the Sn 2+
ions dissolved in strong acidic aqueous solution undergo a hydrolysis reaction, and form Sn(OH) +
intermediate species. Sn(OH) +
is then oxidized to Sn 4+
by the dissolved oxygen in the solution 24 . The Sn 4+
ions then react with OH -
ions, provided by the decomposition of urea, to form Sn(OH) 4
species, which are converted to SnO 2
via a dehydration reaction (top branch in Fig.
1i ) 24 , 27 . However, Sn 2+
ions from Sn(OH) +
can then be readily incorporated into the SnO 2
lattice owing to the comparable ionic radii of Sn 2+
(0.62 Å) and Sn 4+
(0.69 Å) for hexa-coordinated Sn species (middle branch in Fig.
1i ) 28 , 29 , 30 . The incorporation of Sn 2+
into the SnO 2
lattice leads to the formation of oxygen vacancies in the SnO 2
layer to preserve charge neutrality. This leads to nonstoichiometric SnO 2– x , which is synthesized in stage A-iii, as a result of a sharp decrease in oxygen dissolved in the reaction solution. When the reaction reaches stage B, a different Sn intermediate species, Sn 3 (OH) 4 2+ , forms in the reaction 25 , 31 . The Sn 3 (OH) 4 2+
intermediate species can undergo a condensation reaction when the pH is sufficiently high, resulting in Sn 6 O 4 (OH) 4
(refs.
25 , 26 , 32 ). The Sn 6 O 4 (OH) 4
is then partially transformed to SnO via a dehydration reaction, producing a mixture of Sn 6 O 4 (OH) 4
and SnO (bottom branch in Fig.
1i ), consistent with the X-ray diffraction results 26 , 33 . SnO 2
ETL-based PSCs We fabricated a series of PSCs up to different stages for the growth of the SnO 2
layer to evaluate device performance (Fig.
2 ). PSCs with stage A-i SnO 2
show an average efficiency of about 20% with a relatively wide power conversion efficiency (PCE) distribution (Fig.
2a ). A noticeable improvement in device performance is observed for stage A-ii SnO 2 , where the PCE exceeds 24%, with the greatest improvements in
V OC
and fill factor (Supplementary Fig.
5 ). These devices show a stabilized power output of up to 24.5% with a certified quasi-steady state PCE up to 24.2% (Fig.
2b
and Supplementary Figs.
6 − 9 ). We attribute this substantial advancement in device performance to complete and conformal coverage of the SnO 2
layer, which prevents interfacial recombination. In contrast, when the reaction reaches stage A-iii, we observe a noticeable drop in device performance, with the greatest contribution from lower fill factor and
V OC
values despite complete film coverage and no detectable non-SnO 2
phases. To understand this device result, we performed time-resolved photoluminescence and transient photovoltage measurements to probe the interaction between the SnO 2
layers (stages A-ii and A-iii) and the perovskite active layer carefully (Fig.
2c, d ). Fig. 2: Solar cell performance of PSCs based on various SnO 2

sample indicates heavy non-radiative recombination at the interface, whereas a favourable interface is achieved for the stage A-ii SnO 2
sample.
d , Transient photovoltage traces for stage A-ii SnO 2 - and stage A-iii SnO 2 -based perovskite solar cells. The decay time, determined as the time it takes to each 1/e intensity, for stages A-ii and A-iii is 37.8 μs and 17.9 μs, respectively. The longer decay time for the A-ii SnO 2 -based device further suggests reduced non-radiative recombination at the interface.
e , Schematic illustration of the progress of the reaction highlighting stage A-ii as the ‘magic region’, which exhibits ideal film coverage, morphology and chemical composition . Full size image Defects within a solar cell act as a carrier trap sites where the energy is lost through non-radiative recombination pathways. Thus, an ideal solar cell should be free from such trap sites. We performed time-resolved photoluminescence measurements because detrimental interfacial trap states lead to reduced carrier lifetimes. The time-resolved photoluminescence results show a much shorter carrier lifetime for stage A-iii SnO 2
than for stage A-ii samples, indicating an increase in non-radiative interfacial recombination between SnO 2
and perovskite, and thus leading to lower photovoltage and fill factor. From transient photovoltage measurements, we confirmed much longer decay times in stage A-ii devices than in stage A-iii PSCs, which further indicates reduced non-radiative pathways for stage A-ii SnO 2 -based devices. Inferior device performance for stage A-iii SnO 2
devices is the result of reduced carrier lifetime, where the increase in defects in the SnO 2
layer is responsible for an increase in non-radiative recombination pathways. In metal oxide thin films, oxygen vacancies act as site defects; their negative effects are especially important in films composed of tiny domains with high surface areas, such as in our SnO 2
films synthesized via chemical bath deposition. Both X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet−visible absorption spectroscopy suggest higher concentrations of defects for stage A-iii SnO 2 , as a form of oxygen vacancy, shown by the shift of the Sn 3 d 5/2
state towards lower binding energy (Supplementary Fig.
10a ) 28 , 30 , 34 , 35 , 36 , gradual increase in absorptivity in the ultraviolet−blue wavelength range (Supplementary Fig.
10b ), and higher Raman signal (Supplementary Fig.
11 ). The uncontrolled formation of defects in stage A-iii SnO 2
films not only increases charge recombination at the SnO 2 /perovskite interface, but also limits electron transport through SnO 2
nanodomains (Supplementary Fig.
12 ). On the other hand, the suppressed formation of surface defects for stage A-ii SnO 2
films is critical for realizing high fill factor and a low
V OC
deficit, along with appropriate surface coverage (Supplementary Fig.
13 ). In addition, the ETL needs to have a deep relative valence band in order to efficiently prevent hole quenching at the ETL/perovskite interface. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy shows that the deepest valence band is achieved during stage A-ii (Supplementary Fig.
14 ). This further supports the reduction of charge recombination in the device and thus the high efficiency observed for PSCs fabricated using stage A-ii SnO 2
(ref.
37 ). Lastly, the PSCs with stage B SnO 2
show the lowest PCE, probably owing to the formation of non-SnO 2– x
phases, such as Sn 6 O 4 (OH) 4
and SnO, which are not electron-transporting, along with overproduction of oxygen vacancies in the SnO 2
layer. The overall understanding of the chemistry during the synthesis of SnO 2
via chemical bath deposition is illustrated in Fig.
2e
(see Methods for a detailed discussion). Effect of the MAPbBr 3
additive In addition to engineering the physical and electrical properties of the ETL, further improvements in PSC performance can be achieved by improving the optoelectronic properties of the perovskite active layer. An ideal active layer should present a high absorption profile to maximize carrier generation with long carrier lifetimes and mobilities for efficient carrier collection. This requires developing strategies to improve crystal grain size and carrier lifetime, while preventing the formation of detrimental traps at the bulk and interfaces. Notably, improving the efficiency of PSCs requires the decoupling of the passivation strategies for the bulk and the interface because the type and concentration of defects affect them differently. In the second part of our holistic approach, we show that only a trace amount of methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr 3 ) (<1 mol%) is needed to stabilize the perovskite active layer, with the benefit of improved optoelectronic properties. Figure
3
shows the characterization of perovskite thin films passivated with a two-dimensional perovskite, with the bulk perovskite fabricated with the addition of various amounts of MAPbBr 3 . An increase in grain size with decreasing amounts of MAPbBr 3
is clear in the SEM images of Fig.
3a . The correlation suggests that MAPbBr 3
arrests perovskite grain growth, probably owing to the slow diffusion of the large bromide anion 38
in a perovskite thin film fabricated with methylammonium chloride (MACl) additives, where MACl has been reported to promote perovskite crystal grain growth. Fig. 3: Characterization of perovskite thin films varying the mole per cent of MAPbBr 3

are obtained from a mono-exponential fit.
e , Effective mobility for perovskite thin films determined from optical pump−terahertz probe measurements (error bars show one standard deviation). Full size image In addition to changes in grain size and morphology, the absorption onset and the photoluminescence peak redshifts are consistent with decreased incorporation of MAPbBr 3
into the perovskite crystal as lower amounts of MAPbBr 3
are added (Fig.
3b ). Notably, X-ray diffraction analysis shows successful passivation of the perovskite active layer from the detrimental formamidinium lead iodide (δ-FAPbI 3 ) phase with a MAPbBr 3
concentration as low as 0.8 mol% (Fig.
3c ) 39 , 40 . Such a low concentration is in contrast to the commonly used range of 7−20 mol%, which was established through processes that passivate both the bulk and the interface in one step. We believe stabilization of the intermediate phase, before thermal annealing, is responsible for successful stabilization of α-FAPbI 3
even at such a low MAPbBr 3
concentration (Supplementary Figs.
15 ,
16 ). The two-dimensional perovskite passivation we used is thus shown to be effective in stabilizing the interface, which is prone to the formation of defects and the unfavourable δ-phase 8 , 41 . Carrier lifetimes can be determined through fitting the time-resolved photoluminescence decays to a mono-exponential function (Fig.
3d ). Films with MAPbBr 3
added below 2.5 mol% show substantially longer carrier lifetimes than the 10 mol% sample, with the longest carrier lifetime observed in the 0.8 mol% sample (>3.6 μs). Carrier lifetimes in the microsecond range suggest that there are few non-radiative pathways and such long carrier lifetimes can lead to high
V OC . We attribute the long carrier lifetimes to a combination of increased perovskite crystal grain size and successful passivation using the two-dimensional perovskite. Detrimental halide segregation, which is suspected to form carrier trap sites, is likely to be reduced at low MAPbBr 3
concentrations and this may also contribute to the increased carrier lifetimes 8 , 42 . Carrier dynamics can be obtained using optical pump−terahertz probe spectroscopy, measuring transient photoconductivity (–Δ T / T ) at different carrier densities (Fig.
3e
and Supplementary Fig.
17 ). With an increase in fluence, and thus an increase in carrier density, the –Δ T / T
increases and the decay trace develops a fast component corresponding to increasing higher-order recombinations. An effective mobility can be calculated from the recombination dynamics measured by optical pump−terahertz probe measurements 43 . Figure
3e
plots effective mobilities as a function of the mole per cent added MAPbBr 3 . Interestingly, the effective mobility increases from 0 mol% to 2.5 mol% (26.8 cm 2  V –1  s –1
to 31.2 cm 2  V –1  s –1 ), before dropping down to 25.9 cm 2  V –1  s –1
for 10 mol%. Indeed, as we have observed for grain sizes (Fig.
3a ) and carrier lifetimes (Fig.
3d ), this low-concentration region can yield large changes in morphologies and carrier dynamics, which correlate with effective mobility. It is also possible that the perovskite crystal orientation, which is known to influence effective mobilities 44 , and homogenization of halides may also be affected at low concentrations of added MAPbBr 3 . Thus, through separately passivating the bulk (with extremely low amounts of MAPbBr 3 ) and the interface (with two-dimensional perovskite passivation 8 ), highly efficient PSCs can be fabricated by substantially reducing the MAPbBr 3
concentration, with the added benefit of reducing the bandgap penalty. Solar cell and electroluminescence performance PSCs were fabricated by combining our newly developed SnO 2
ETL and the improved perovskite layer described above. These PSCs show an average PCE of 24.7%, with some devices exceeding a PCE of 25%, when measured in-house (blue data points, Fig.
4a ). The best performing devices were sent to the solar cell device testing facility in Newport, USA, for certification with the test results shown as the red data points in Fig.
4a . The best-performing device achieved a certified PCE of 25.2% from a quasi-steady-state measurement, with PCEs determined from the current−voltage ( J−V ) sweep to be 25.3% and 25.4% for the reverse and forward sweep, respectively (Fig.
4b
and Supplementary Figs.
18 − 21 ) 45 . In addition, the certified device showed almost no change in PCE during up to 3,600 h of storage (Supplementary Fig.
22 ). Additionally, the encapsulated device retained about 80% of its initial PCE after 500 h under continuous light illumination at maximum power point (100 mW cm −2 , AM1.5G, 45 °C), without an ultraviolet cut filter (Supplementary Fig.
23 ). We also fabricated PSCs with larger areas; our best-performing large-area cell (0.984 cm 2 ) exhibits PCEs up to 23.0% with a high
V OC
value of 1,196 mV (Fig.
4c ). Fig. 4: Device result for best-performing PSCs with 0.8 mol% MAPbBr 3 . a , Statistical distribution represented in box-and-whisker plots (centre line: average, box limit: standard deviation, whiskers: outliers) for best-performing PSCs (0.0937 cm 2

The blue points show the PCE values measured in-house and the red points show the PCE values measured at Newport for certification purposes.

curves of a larger-area PSC exhibiting a PCE up to 23%. The active area is 0.984 cm 2 , defined by a mask aperture. The inset is a photograph, where the dotted outlines approximate the mask aperture.
d , Electroluminescence EQE and ECE values of our PSC under forward bias. Their maximum values are given. The inset shows the device (left photograph) with visible red emission upon voltage bias (right photograph). Full size image The bandgap of this record cell,
E g  = 1.56 eV, was determined from the inflection point of the EQE curve (Supplementary Fig.
24 ) 11 . This bandgap corresponds to a thermodynamic PCE upper limit of 31.3%. At 25.2% PCE, our best-performing certified cell is thus at 80.5% of the theoretical efficiency limit, which is comparable to the best Si solar cells, which are at 80.9% of the theoretical limit 46 . We attribute the high PCEs of our cells to major improvements in the
V OC
and the fill factor. The radiative
V OC
limit
V OC rad
is calculated to be 1.270 V and the
V OC
measured without an aperture mask reaches 1.225 V (Supplementary Fig.
25 ) 6 , 11 , 47 , resulting in a ratio of
V OC
to the radiative
V OC
limit of up to 96.5%, which is the highest reported thus far for a PSC, and is within striking distance of that for GaAs (97.7%). Such a low
V OC
deficit suggests that almost all non-radiative recombination pathways have been efficiently eliminated and that these PSCs should be highly luminescent when operated as a light-emitting diode, as we find below. Figure
4d
shows a plot of the electroluminescence EQE and energy conversion efficiency (ECE) values versus voltage of a PSC measured under forward bias (the current−luminance−voltage curve is provided in Supplementary Fig.
26 ). We observe an electroluminescence EQE of up to 17.2%, which approaches the efficiency of the best-performing perovskite light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which are engineered specifically for efficient light emission 48 , 49 , 50 . In addition, due to early sub-bandgap turn-on, probably from thermal carriers, our PSCs exhibit a peak electroluminescence ECE of up to 21.6%. In addition to extremely low
V OC
loss and high luminescence efficiency, our devices exhibit a high fill factor of up to 84.8%. Such a high fill factor is a result of improved carrier mobility in the perovskite active layer and better charge collection with the SnO 2
ETL developed here with minimum parasitic losses from shunt and series resistances. For a further improvement in fill factor, future research should be focused on minimizing trap-assisted recombination, aiming to approach the theoretical fill factor limit of about 90%.

Abstract Owing to rapid development in their efficiency 1
and stability 2 , perovskite solar cells are at the forefront of emerging photovoltaic technologies. State-of-the-art cells exhibit voltage losses 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8
approaching the theoretical minimum and near-unity internal quantum efficiency 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , but conversion efficiencies are limited by the fill factor (<83%, below the Shockley–Queisser limit of approximately 90%). This limitation results from non-ideal charge transport between the perovskite absorber and the cell’s electrodes 5 , 8 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 . Reducing the electrical series resistance of charge transport layers is therefore crucial for improving efficiency. Here we introduce a reverse-doping process to fabricate nitrogen-doped titanium oxide electron transport layers with outstanding charge transport performance. By incorporating this charge transport material into perovskite solar cells, we demonstrate 1-cm 2
cells with fill factors of >86%, and an average fill factor of 85.3%. We also report a certified steady-state efficiency of 22.6% for a 1-cm 2
cell (23.33% ± 0.58% from a reverse current–voltage scan).

Stable and low-photovoltage-loss perovskite solar cells by multifunctional passivation

Main Nitrogen-doped titanium oxide (titanium oxynitride, TiO x N y ) has been widely investigated for photocatalysis 17 , 18 , but rarely in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). PSCs incorporating solution-processed TiO x N y
have been reported, but device performances have not exceeded that of PSCs with standard TiO x
electron transport layers (ETLs) 19 , 20 , because the stoichiometric control required to optimize metal oxide transport layer properties is challenging with solution processing. Instead, we report here a reverse-doping method to produce high-quality TiO x N y
films by oxidizing sputtered titanium nitride thin films using a controlled annealing temperature in an oxygen atmosphere (details are provided in the Methods). In addition to producing high-quality TiO x N y
films, sputtering is already widely used in the photovoltaic and electronics industries and is therefore a promising deposition method for commercial fabrication of PSCs. TiO x N y
film composition and morphology To understand the effect of the annealing process on the physical and electronic properties of TiO x N y , we prepared films (thickness ~50 nm) with seven different annealing conditions: as deposited (room temperature), 300 °C, 350 °C, 400 °C, 450 °C, 500 °C and 550 °C. There is no significant difference in the morphology of the resulting TiO x N y
films (Extended Data Fig.
1 ), and they are similar to the bare fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass substrates. We next investigate the elemental composition of TiO x N y
using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig.
1a , the Ti 2+
oxidation state 21
is present in the as-deposited TiN film as evidenced by the presence of O 1 s
(refs.  15 , 22 ; Fig.
1b ) and O–Ti–N (refs.  18 , 23 , 24 ) XPS peaks (Fig.
1c ). The appearance of Ti 3+
and Ti 4+
states after annealing at 300 °C indicates partial oxidation of the TiN, and oxidation increases at higher temperatures. For samples annealed at 450 °C and above, only the highest Ti 4+
oxidation state is present 15 , 21 . Meanwhile, the TiN (refs.  18 , 23 ) peak weakens and eventually disappears at higher annealing temperatures, and two new N 1 s
core-level peaks (NO x
(refs.  18 , 23 , 25 ) and γ-N 2
(refs.  23 , 26 ) (chemisorbed N 2 )) are observed (Fig.
1c ). This further demonstrates that the chemical states of Ti and N within TiO x N y
lattices continuously change as the oxidation temperature increases. More details of the XPS analysis can be found in the Methods. Fig. 1: XPS characterization of TiO x N y
films annealed at different temperatures. a – c , Evolution of the chemical state of Ti ( a ), O ( b ) and N ( c ) in TiO x N y
films under different oxidation conditions. Note that the Ti 2 p
peaks centred at binding energies of ~457.5 eV and ~463.4 eV and the N 1 s
peak centred at ~399.5-eV binding energy can be ascribed to the satellite features of TiN. The black data points in
a ,
b
and the black line in
c
are raw data; the red lines in
a
to
c
are envelope curves. Full size image By combining the elements’ relative peak areas and sensitivity factors (Extended Data Fig.
2 ), we calculate that the atomic ratio of O/Ti (N/Ti) is 0.58 (0.62) for the as-deposited film. The O/Ti atomic ratio increases with annealing temperature, reaching a peak of 2.24 at 500 °C before decreasing. In contrast, the N/Ti ratio decreases monotonically with annealing temperature. However, N atoms remain in the TiO x N y
film at higher temperatures, with N/Ti ratios of 0.08 and 0.07 for samples annealed at 500 °C and 550 °C, respectively. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging (Extended Data Fig.
3a ) shows that the as-deposited film is not completely crystalline and features an amorphous contrast along with a distribution of crystalline particles with characteristic sizes ranging from 10 nm to 20 nm. A survey of the first two diffraction rings from the polycrystalline pattern in Fig.
2a
reveals diffracting planes corresponding to distances of
d 1  = 2.45 ± 0.07 Å and
d 2  = 2.12 ± 0.06 Å, which can be respectively assigned to the cubic phases of TiO (ref.  27 ) and TiN (ref.  27 ) ( d (111),TiO  = 2.411 Å,
d (200),TiO  = 2.088 Å;
d (111),TiN  = 2.445 Å,
d (200),TiN  = 2.117 Å). Detailed parameters for simulation are summarized in  Supplementary Table 1 . Given the XPS result, which shows a large concentration of N relative to O, and the difficulty of differentiating the cubic TiO from the cubic TiN (Extended Data Fig.
2 ), we conclude that the observed crystalline phase has a composition of the type TiO x N y . Similar analysis of the films annealed at 300 °C, 350 °C and 400 °C indicates that these are also largely composed of the cubic TiO x N y
phase (Fig.
2
and Extended Data Fig.
4 ). Note that there are two rings in the diffraction patterns of the sample annealed at 400 °C (Fig.
2c ), which can be allocated to the tetragonal anatase crystal phases of TiO x N y
(ref.  28 ). Fig. 2: TEM characterization and simulation of the diffraction pattern. a , TiO x N y
without annealing (as deposited).
b – d , TiO x N y
annealed at 300 °C ( b ), 400 °C ( c ) and 500 °C ( d ). Scale bars, 10 nm −1 . The crystal phases of the TiO x N y
annealed at 300 °C and 400 °C are cubic TiO x N y
mixtures. Note that it is unusual for the rutile phase of TiO x N y
to form at the relatively low annealing temperature of 450 °C. In contrast, solution-processed TiO x
forms an anatase phase when annealed at 500 °C and 550 °C ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Anatase is often the first TiO x
crystal phase to form in many fabrication processes, owing to its low surface energy 33 , even though it is not an equilibrium phase for TiO x
in terms of the lattice stability. It typically converts to rutile, a more thermally stable phase, at temperatures above 550 °C (ref.  33 ). However, studies suggest that the phase transition temperature strongly depends on impurities (or dopants) as well as on the morphology of the sample 33 , 34 , 35 . This may explain the formation of rutile TiO x N y
phase in the sample annealed at 450 °C. Full size image The combined evidence of the XPS and TEM analysis shows that oxidation at low temperatures (<400 °C) starts a restructuring process in which TiN and TiO crystals transform into amorphous TiO x N y , which then continues to form TiO x N y
crystals under oxidation at high temperatures (>450 °C). Compared with the as-deposited sample and those annealed at 300 °C, 350 °C and 400 °C, an increased crystalline fraction is observed for the TiO x N y
film annealed at 450 °C and above (Extended Data Figs.
3
and
4 ). The diffraction patterns of the sample annealed at 450 °C are dominated by a combination of tetragonal anatase and rutile phases of TiO x N y
(ref.  28 ), accompanied by the complete disappearance of the cubic TiO x N y
phase (Extended Data Fig.
4d ). At the highest temperature investigated, the film annealed at 550 °C features large tetragonal crystals with sizes of greater than 20 nm with similar crystal phases to those of the film annealed at 500 °C (Fig.
2d
and Extended Data Fig.
4e, f ). Optoelectronic properties of TiO x N y
film The as-deposited TiN film has a workfunction (WF) of ~4.32 eV (Fig.
3a ) and an optical bandgap ( E g ) of ~3.25 eV (Extended Data Fig.
5 ), similar to literature values 29 . The WF values of the samples annealed at 300 °C, 350 °C, 400 °C, 450 °C, 500 °C and 550 °C are 4.32 eV, 4.29 eV, 4.14 eV, 4.08 eV, 4.16 eV, 4.14 eV and 4.28 eV, respectively, which are associated with the free-carrier density (or doping density) change and/or surface dipoles within the TiO x N y
films. Figure

shows the energy level distribution of TiO x N y
films for different annealing temperatures, extracted by combining data from ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) spectra (Fig.
3a ) and

measurements (Extended Data Fig.
5 ). Fig. 3: Optoelectronic properties of TiO x N y

d , Optical transmittance of TiO x N y
films (deposited on FTO substrates). Note that the VBM is determined by the sum of WF and ( E F  −  E v ), where
E v
represents VBM; the CBM is determined by VBM −  E g . The detailed data of the UPS and Hall effect measurements are also provided in  Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 , respectively. Full size image In addition to the WF change, the energy difference (Δ E ) between the Fermi level ( E F ) and the conduction band minimum of TiO x N y
increases with higher annealing temperatures. This indicates a reduction in free-carrier density (or doping density) of the n-type TiO x N y , which we quantify using Hall effect measurements (Fig.
3c ). The charge carrier density decreases steadily with increasing annealing temperatures up to 400 °C, followed by a drop of approximately three orders of magnitude between the samples annealed at 400 °C (5.1 × 10 20  cm −3 ) and 450 °C (5.0 × 10 17  cm −3 ). This coincides with the formation of the higher oxidation state of Ti, and loss of N from the TiO x N y
lattice, as discussed previously. The carrier density decreases to 3.4 × 10 16  cm −3
for an annealing temperature of 550 °C. Consequently, the conductivity of the films exhibits a similar trend to the free-carrier density; the Hall mobility has an opposite trend (Fig.
3c ). For comparison, we note that a control film made from solution-processed pure TiO x
(ref.  15 ) annealed at 500 °C has a much lower carrier density (4.5 × 10 14  cm −3 ) and conductivity (9.8 × 10 −5
S cm −1 ) than both the TiO x N y
samples annealed at 500 °C and 550 °C. The detailed Hall effect results are summarized in Extended Data Table
1 . Despite the bandgap of the TiO x N y
undergoing no significant change with annealing temperature (Extended Data Fig.
5 ), samples annealed at 400 °C and below exhibit low optical transmittance across the visible spectrum (Fig.
3d ), which we attribute to strong free-carrier absorption 30 . A substantial increase in transmittance for films annealed at temperatures of 450 °C and above coincides with the compositional, structural and electronic transition identified above. Thus, the combination of high conductivity and high optical transmittance for films annealed above 450 °C indicates that TiO x N y
films produced in this way have potential as high-performance ETLs for PSCs. Solar cell characterization Having investigated the physical, electronic and optical properties of the TiO x N y
films, we next investigate their use as ETLs in n-i-p PSCs. The devices studied here feature a structure of glass/FTO/TiO x N y

and Extended Data Fig.
6 ). Here meso-TiO 2
represents mesoporous TiO 2 , PMMA (ref.  5 ) and PMMA:PCBM (ref.  5 ) are ultrathin interface passivation layers consisting of poly(methyl-methacrylate) and PMMA:([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric-acid-methyl-ester), respectively, and P3HT:CuPc (ref.  8 ) is a blended hole transport layer (HTL) consisting of poly(3-hexylthiophene) and copper phthalocyanine. Solution-processed compact TiO x
(ref.  15 ) substitutes TiO x N y
as the ETL in the control cells. Fig. 4: Device characterization and simulation. a ,

ETLs were fabricated at 500 °C and all
J – V
curves of the cells (effective area, 1.2 cm 2 ) were measured using an aperture mask (certified area, 1.0189 cm 2 ). Given that the meso-TiO 2
must be annealed at 500 °C to completely remove the organic compounds from the TiO 2
paste, the TiO x N y
ETLs processed at low temperature (<500 °C) are not selected for our PSCs in this work.

Right, diagram of the ex situ and in situ conductivity of two doping levels of the ETL (right). Full size image As shown in Fig.
4a , our champion TiO x N y -based cell with an active area of 1-cm 2
yielded a PCE of 23.36% (23.38%) with
V OC  ~ 1.193 V (1.200 V),
J SC  ~ 22.80 mA cm −2
(22.89 mA cm −2 ) and fill factor (FF) ~ 0.859 (0.851) from reverse (forward) scan in-house measurements. The TiO x -based control cell exhibited a maximum PCE of 21.65% ( V OC  ~ 1.172 V,
J SC  ~ 22.75 mA cm −2
and FF ~ 0.812) and 21.22% ( V OC  ~ 1.171 V,
J SC  ~ 22.70 mA cm −2
and FF ~ 0.798) from reverse and forward scans, respectively. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra and perovskite optical bandgap ( E g  ~ 1.57 eV) plots confirm the accuracy of the measured photocurrent as demonstrated by a discrepancy <2% between the integrated
J SC
from the EQE spectra and the
J SC
measured from the
J – V
curve (Fig.
4b ). Another cell was submitted to an independent testing centre and achieved a certified efficiency of ~23.33% ± 0.58% with a FF of 86.68% ± 1.01% from a reverse
J – V
scan, and a steady-state efficiency of ~22.6% ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). This is, to our knowledge, the highest certified efficiency for 1-cm 2
PSCs 1
and the highest FF reported for a PSC of any size ( Supplementary Tables 4 and 5 ). The
J – V
parameter distribution plots in Fig.
4c
and Extended Data Fig.
7a
illustrate the reproducibility of our 1-cm 2
PSCs. The average PCE of the TiO x N y -based cells is 23.09% ± 0.11% with an average FF ~ 0.853 ± 0.005, while that of the TiO x -based cells is 21.26% ± 0.33% (average FF ~ 0.793 ± 0.014). There is little difference in both
V OC
and
J SC
between the TiO x N y - and TiO x -based cells (Extended Data Fig.
7a ), so the efficiency gains for TiO x N y -based cells are dominated by the higher FF that results from improved electron transport. A similar trend was also found between the TiO x N y - and TiO x -based PSCs fabricated with indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates (see  Supplementary Fig. 3
and discussion in the Methods). PSCs fabricated with TiO x N y
ETLs annealed at 550 °C exhibited a lower average PCE of 21.42% ± 0.32% with substantial FF losses (Extended Data Fig.
7b, c ) compared to cells processed at 500 °C. This is due to the order-of-magnitude reduction in carrier density in the sample annealed at 550 °C compared to that annealed at 500 °C. We performed scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements to investigate the effect of ETL composition on subsequently deposited perovskite films. As seen in  Supplementary Fig. 4 , we found no evidence of changes in the surface morphology (from SEM images), or in crystal structure, orientation or crystallinity (from X-ray diffraction measurements) of perovskite films deposited on the different substrates. There was also little difference in the time-resolved photoluminescence decay measurements, consistent with the experimental cell
V OC
values. This suggests that the very high FFs of the TiO x N y -based perovskite cells are derived from the improved electronic property of the TiO x N y
film itself. To explain how TiO x N y
can significantly increase FF, we employed numerical one-dimensional, multilayer ionic–electronic numerical device simulations. Our focus is on the electrostatics of the perovskite/ETL/FTO layer structure. The empirical data suggest that increased dopant density is the only electronic factor that conclusively distinguishes TiO x N y
from TiO x . Yet a simple analytical treatment based on ex situ conductivity of the ETL layers cannot explain the difference in FF. For 50-nm ETL layers, the optimum TiO x N y
( N D  = 3 × 10 17  cm −3 ) reduces the voltage losses relative to TiO x
( N D  = 5 × 10 14  cm −3 ) by only ~3 mV at the maximum power point (MPP) current of 22 mA cm −2
(where the electron mobility
μ e  = 0.5 cm 2  V −1  s −1 ). This is a small fraction of the experimental mean MPP voltage loss of approximately 80 mV. Instead, our model explains the resistance-related FF loss by showing that heavy doping of the ETL layer protects against electron depletion that can occur in regions of positive space charge at the perovskite/ETL and FTO/ETL heterojunctions. Equilibrium conditions in the perovskite/ETL/FTO structure deplete the ETL of electrons to concentrations that can be orders of magnitude below the fixed dopant density (Fig.
4d ). At the TiO x
dopant density of 5 × 10 14  cm −3 , the equilibrium free-electron concentration can be closer to 10 13  cm −3 , introducing many tens of millivolts of voltage loss in the ETL at MPP currents (see Extended Data Fig.
8
for details). Our simulations suggest that although modifications of the WF alignment between these materials, and in particular the ETL and FTO layer, can mitigate the effect to some extent, high doping ( ⪆ 10 17  cm −3 ) in the ETL layer will, in general, be necessary (although not sufficient) to achieve PSC FFs above approximately 85%. We conclude this work by investigating the cell stability 31 . As seen in Extended Data Fig.
9a , the unencapsulated TiO x N y -based cell exhibited a steady-state PCE of ~22.82% after 250 h of MPP voltage ( V MPP ) tracking under continuous 1 sun illumination in nitrogen, retaining ~98.7% of its initial efficiency (~23.12%). Similarly, the TiO x -based cell (~20.24%) retained ~96.5% of its initial efficiency (~20.97%), demonstrating no significant difference in light-soaking stability between the unencapsulated cells with different ETLs (Extended Data Fig.
9b ). Two cells of each type were also subjected to damp-heat exposure in the dark. For these tests, an additional MoO x
(~10 nm)/indium zinc oxide (~40 nm) barrier layer was deposited between the HTL and the gold electrode resulting in a reduced FF relative to the unencapsulated cells reported above. All four individual cells retained >90% of their initial efficiencies after 1,000 h. Time-dependent power output and
J – V
curves are presented in  Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6
showing the cell performance evolution during the degradation tests. Although both the light-soaking and damp-heat stability tests show promising results, these are not sufficient to guarantee the stability of perovskite cells under real operating conditions where thermal, light and humidity stressors act simultaneously 31 . According to the literature 2 , 32 , the combination of these conditions can accelerate degradation of the perovskite active layer, even in the presence of stable charge transport layers and encapsulation. As the perovskite used in this work was not optimized to withstand such conditions, a more stable composition such as those reported in refs.  2 , 32
would be necessary to realize the full benefits of the TiO x N y
ETL. Methods Materials Lead iodide (99%), lead bromide (99.999%), lead chloride (99.999%), caesium iodide (99.999%), dimethlformamide (DMF, 99.99%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.99%), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA, MW ~ 120,000), [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric-acid-methyl-ester (PCBM, 99.5%), copper phthalocyanine (CuPc, 99%), chlorobenzene (CB, 99.8%), titanium (IV) isopropoxide (TTIP, 99.999%), isopropyl alcohol (IPA, 99.5%), ethyl alcohol (99.5%), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37%) and ITO-coated glass substrates (ITO, 8–12 Ω sq −1 ) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. FTO-coated glass substrates (FTO, 7  Ω sq −1 ), formamidinium iodide (FAI), formamidinium bromide (FABr), methylammonium bromide (MABr) and TiO 2
paste (30 NR-D) were purchased from Greatcell Solar. Methylammonium chloride (MACl) was purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp. Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) was purchased from 1-Materials. The titanium nitride sputtering target was purchased from AJA International. All chemicals were used as received without further purification. Preparation of FTO and ITO substrates The FTO and ITO substrates were sequentially cleaned in detergent, distilled water, acetone, isopropyl alcohol and ethyl alcohol for 20 min in an ultrasonic bath, and then dried with nitrogen. Cleaned FTO and ITO substrates were exposed to approximately 30 min of UV–O 3
treatment before the subsequent deposition step. Note that Sigma Aldrich’s ITO product information ( https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/AU/en/product/aldrich/578274?context=product ) says that “ITO coated float glass is only offered with a SiO 2
passivation layer applied directly on the glass prior to ITO coating. The passivation layer is intended to minimize the leaching of alkali oxides into liquid crystals, which can have a detrimental effect on the volume resistivity of the liquid crystal.” Preparation of nitrogen-doped titanium ETLs First, titanium nitride thin films were deposited on the pre-cleaned FTO (ITO) substrates by radiofrequency magnetron sputtering at 300 W and 20 sccm Ar gas using a titanium nitride target under a pressure of 1.5 mtorr. Second, the pre-fabricated titanium nitride thin films were then transferred to a furnace, and annealed at different temperatures ranging from 300 °C to 550 °C for 45 min under a controlled oxygen atmosphere, where the time of oxygen flow (gas flow ~5 l min −1 ) was fixed at 5 min (note that the timing was calculated at the beginning of the annealing period). Samples were then cooled to 200 °C in the furnace before being removed. Preparation of solution-processed titanium oxide ETLs Compact TiO x
thin films of ~50 nm were deposited on the pre-cleaned FTO (ITO) substrates according to our previous work 15 , where the compact TiO x
precursor solution contained 369 µl TTIP and 35 µl 2 M HCl in 5 ml anhydrous IPA. Preparation of mesoporous titanium oxide scaffold layers Mesoporous TiO 2
scaffold layers of ~40 nm were deposited on the FTO/TiO x N y
or FTO/TiO x
substrates according to our previous work 5 , where the mesoporous TiO 2
precursor solution was prepared from 30 nm TiO 2
paste diluted in ethyl alcohol (1:9, w/w). All samples were annealed at 500 °C for 30 min under dry air. Preparation of precursor solution The Cs 0.05 FA 0.9 MA 0.05 PbI 2.74 Br 0.26
perovskite precursor solution contains 0.065 M CsI, 1.15 M PbI 2 , 0.11 M PbBr 2 , 1.1 M FAI, 0.045 M FABr, 0.065 M MABr, 0.01 M PbCl 2 , 0.01 M MACl in 1 ml anhydrous DMF/DMSO (4:1, v/v). PMMA:PCBM (ref.  5 ) passivation precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 0.5 mg PMMA and 1.5 mg PCBM into 1 ml CB. PMMA (ref.  5 ) passivation precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 0.25 mg ml −1
PMMA in CB. P3HT:CuPc (ref.  8 ) HTL precursor solution was prepared with a 10:1 (v/v) ratio blend of P3HT (12 mg ml −1
in CB)/CuPc (5 mg ml −1
in CB). Device fabrication For the ultrathin passivation layer deposition, ~100 µl PMMA:PCBM precursor solution was dropped onto the FTO/TiO x N y
(or TiO x )/meso-TiO 2
substrates and deposited by spin-coating at 5,000 r.p.m. with a ramp of 5,000 r.p.m. s −1
for 30 s, then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. Cs 0.05 FA 0.88 MA 0.07 PbI 2.56 Br 0.44
thin films were then deposited on the passivated substrates by a two-step spin-coating programme: first at 2,000 r.p.m. with a ramp of 200 r.p.m. s −1
for 10 s, and then at 4,000 r.p.m. with a ramp of 1,000 r.p.m. s −1
for 20 s. The perovskite precursor film was immediately transferred into a custom-built vacuum flash 36
system where a two-step vacuum procedure was applied: first, the system was immediately pumped down to a low pressure of ~100 mtorr and held for 20 s; the pressure was then increased to ~1.2 torr and held for another 10 s. The pump valve was then turned off and left to return to atmospheric pressure. After the vacuum flash treatment, the perovskite sample was immediately annealed on a hotplate at 100 °C for 120 s. The sample was then returned to the spin-coater and cooled down by fast rotation at 5,000 r.p.m. with a ramp of 5,000 r.p.m. s −1
for 60 s. Next, the PMMA passivation treatment was applied: first, ~100 µl PMMA solution (0.25 mg ml −1
in chlorobenzene) was dropped onto the perovskite sample and left for 2 s; second, the sample was spin-coated for 15 s at 5,000 r.p.m with a ramp of 5,000 r.p.m. s −1 ; finally, the sample was annealed on a hotplate at 100 °C for 60 min. The P3HT:CuPc HTL was deposited via spin-coating at 2,000 r.p.m. with a ramp of 500 r.p.m. s −1
for 30 s. Finally, ~100 nm gold was deposited through a shadow mask (cell area 1.2 cm 2 ). All depositions were conducted in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. Solar cell characterization All devices were tested under 1 sun conditions (100 mW cm −2 , AM 1.5G) in a solar simulator system (Wavelab Inc.). The light intensity was calibrated using a certified Fraunhofer CalLab reference cell. All
J – V
curves were measured at a 20 mV s −1
scan rate with an aperture mask (certified area is ~1.0189 cm 2 ) in a custom-built measurement jig under nitrogen flow. Note that the reverse scan is from
V OC
to
J SC
(forward bias → short circuit, 1.2 V → −0.1 V), and the forward scan is from
J SC
to
V OC
(short circuit → forward bias, −0.1 V → 1.2 V). EQE was measured using the d.c. measurement module on a commercial EQE system (CEP-25ML, Bunkoukeiki). For the TiO x N y
perovskite cell, the estimated spectrum mismatch correction is 98.36% based on the comparison between the integrated current density calculated from the EQE response and the current density measured under the solar simulator. No preconditioning protocol was applied before the characterization. The performance distribution of TiO x N y -based PSCs fabricated with ITO substrates is shown in  Supplementary Fig. 3 . The average PCE of TiO x N y
cells is 22.78% ± 0.17% (champion PCE ~ 23.09%) with FF ~ 0.842 ± 0.006 (champion FF ~ 0.849), while that of TiO x
(‘Control’) cells is 21.03% ± 0.27% (champion PCE ~ 21.47%) with FF ~ 0.785 ± 0.012 (champion FF ~ 0.802). Note that the performance of ITO-based TiO x N y
or TiO x
cells is lower than that of the corresponding FTO-based TiO x N y
or TiO x
cells. This is because the sheet resistance of ITO substrates (initially 8–10 Ω sq −1 ) increases to ~26–30 Ω sq −1
when annealed at 500 °C for 30 min, while that of FTO substrates (~7 Ω sq −1 ) does not change. For this reason, the slightly decreased performance of ITO-based cells originates from the increased sheet resistance of the ITO substrates. Damp-heat test The damp-heat (85 °C, 85% relative humidity) tests under dark conditions were performed using a climate test chamber (Weiss Technik). When measuring the cells during the aging, samples were removed from the chamber and allowed to cool down to room temperature. Note that the perovskite cells used for the damp-heat tests included an additional barrier layer deposited on the HTL before the gold electrode. The barrier layer consisted of ~10 nm MoO x
deposited by thermal evaporation followed by ~40 nm of indium zinc oxide deposited by sputtering. The function of the MoO x
was to prevent sputtering damage to the underlying HTL. The rest of the cell fabrication was identical to the process described above. Cells were then encapsulated between two pieces of glass and the edges were sealed with polyisobutylene 37 . Film characterization The top morphology of bare FTO and FTO/TiO x N y
samples was imaged with a non-contact tapping-mode atomic force microscope (Asylum Research). XPS and UPS measurements were carried out on an XPS machine (Escalab 250 Xi, Thermo Fisher), with a monochromatic Al Kα (1486.7 eV) X-ray source for XPS and a He
i
(21.2 eV) gas discharge lamp for UPS. The detailed XPS peak analysis is presented below. As shown in Fig.
1a , the Ti 2+
oxidation state is present in the as-deposited TiN film, with the Ti 2 p
peaks centred at binding energies of ~456.1 eV and ~461.6 eV (ref.  21 ). In addition, the O 1 s
XPS peak indicates the presence of a significant amount of O even in the as-deposited sample (Fig.
1b ). This might be caused by the natural oxidation of the TiN sputtering target during storage or by oxidation from residual oxygen in the chamber during the sputtering process. For the sample annealed at 300 °C, the Ti 2 p
core-level peaks are at binding energies of ~457.1 eV and ~458.6 eV/~464.4 eV, which can be respectively ascribed to Ti 3+
and Ti 4+
oxidation states 15 , 21 , indicating that the TiN starts oxidizing at 300 °C under oxygen atmosphere. Both the TiN and Ti 2+
peaks vanish when annealed at 350 °C, while the Ti 3+
peaks reduce when the annealing temperature is increased from 350 °C to 400 °C. There is no evidence of Ti 3+
peaks in films annealed at 450 °C and above. For the O 1 s
XPS spectra (Fig.
1b ), the dominant peaks at all temperatures are centred at binding energies of ~530.1 eV to ~530.5 eV, which we attribute to titanium oxides 15 , 22
(TiO x ), while the smaller peaks at higher binding energies of ~532.0 eV can be assigned to hydroxyl groups or O 2
(refs.  15 , 22 ). As shown in Fig.
1c , the N 1 s
core-level peak of the as-deposited sample could be deconvoluted into three different N species. The peak centred at ~397.2-eV binding energy and its satellite are indicative of TiN (refs.  18 , 23 ); while the smaller peak centred at a lower binding energy of ~396.5 eV can be allocated to O–Ti–N (refs.  18 , 23 , 24 ), suggesting that the oxidation state of Ti is present in the as-deposited TiN film. This oxidized TiN (that is, O-doped TiN y ) is the early stage of TiO x N y . The relative height of the O–Ti–N peak increases when oxidized at 300 °C and becomes the dominant N 1 s
peak at 350 °C. A new peak centred at a higher binding energy of ~402 eV is observed for the sample annealed at 350 °C, which we attribute to chemisorbed nitrogen, also denoted as γ-N 2
(refs.  23 , 26 ). In addition, the TiN peak vanishes when annealed at 350 °C, consistent with the Ti 2 p
core-level peak analysis (Fig.
1a ). Therefore, the 350 °C oxidized film is dominated by N-doped TiO x
(Extended Data Fig.
2 ). Note that the slight shift of the O–Ti–N peak to a lower binding energy of ~396.2 eV might be caused by the transition of the dominant chemical state of TiO x N y
from O-doped TiN y
to N-doped TiO x . For the sample annealed at 400 °C, a new peak is observed at a binding energy of ~400 eV, which can be ascribed to the NO x
functional group 18 , 23 , 25 . For this sample, the peak intensity of O–Ti–N decreases and the γ-N 2
peak shifts to a slightly higher binding energy of ~403 eV. This is because the oxidation states of Ti within the sample annealed 400 °C at are dominated by Ti 4+
(Fig.
1a ), and O-rich N-doped TiO x
lattices are formed after annealing at 400 °C (see Extended Data Fig.
2 ). Note that the O–Ti–N peak cannot be detected for TiO x N y
films annealed at 450 °C and above. In general, for non-metal-doped TiO x , substitutional doping of the O lattice site is preferred in O-deficient conditions, while interstitial doping is favoured in O-rich conditions 18 . Here the O–Ti–N species in N 1 s
core-level peaks is associated with both O substitutional doping in TiN y
or N substitutional doping in TiO x
lattices, while the NO x
peaks can be attributed to N interstitial doping in O-rich TiO x
lattices 18 , 23 , 25 . The TiO x N y
lattices will be eventually oxidized into pure TiO x
lattices with further increasing the annealing temperature (>550 °C) as the reaction of oxidation of TiN to TiO 2
is thermodynamically favourable 18 , 34 , where the relevant chemical reaction equation is TiN + O 2  → TiO 2  + 1/2 N 2 . UV–Vis transmittance and absorption spectra UV–Vis transmittance and absorption spectra were measured using a PerkinElmer Lambda 1050 UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer. An FEI Verios scanning electron microscope and a Helios Nanolab 600 FIB system were used to investigate the surface morphology and cross-sectional SEM images of the perovskite samples, respectively. The TEM measurements were performed in a JEOL 2100F operating at 200 keV. The simulation of the polycrystalline TEM diffraction patterns was performed using the JEMS 38
code as implemented on version 4.6131U2018.

Metal–organic frameworks Solar cells
Abstract Despite the notable progress in perovskite solar cells, maintaining long-term operational stability and minimizing potentially leaked lead (Pb 2+ ) ions are two challenges that are yet to be resolved. Here we address these issues using a thiol-functionalized 2D conjugated metal–organic framework as an electron-extraction layer at the perovskite/cathode interface. The resultant devices exhibit high power conversion efficiency (22.02%) along with a substantially improved long-term operational stability. The perovskite solar cell modified with a metal–organic framework could retain more than 90% of its initial efficiency under accelerated testing conditions, that is continuous light irradiation at maximum power point tracking for 1,000 h at 85 °C. More importantly, the functionalized metal–organic framework could capture most of the Pb 2+
leaked from the degraded perovskite solar cells by forming water-insoluble solids. Therefore, this method that simultaneously tackles the operational stability and lead contamination issues in perovskite solar cells could greatly improve the feasibility of large-scale deployment of perovskite photovoltaic technology.

Main The certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) has reached a new high at 25.2%, which can rival those of market-dominating inorganic photovoltaic technologies, including polycrystalline silicon (p-Si), thin film copper indium gallium selenide and cadmium telluride 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . The demonstrated high PCE indicates that it is no longer a limiting factor for commercializing PVSCs. As such, research efforts in this field have been gradually shifted to focus on the reliability and stability issues of PVSCs under ambient conditions, light soaking and thermal stresses 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 . By applying composition and crystal engineering, encapsulation, electrode selections, defect passivation and interfacial modifications, the device lifetime can be prolonged by excluding external environmental tensions 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 . Nevertheless, long-term stability of PVSCs under operational conditions has yet to be realized, which remains a critical hurdle to overcome before their large-scale implementation. Moreover, compared to the thermally and chemically stable cadmium telluride having low solubility in water (with a solubility product constant ( K sp ) below 10 −30 ) and presenting a lower toxicity threat to the environment, lead (Pb)-containing compounds in perovskites (or degraded perovskites) have a much higher
K sp
of 10 −8
in rainwater 11 , 14 , 15 , 16 . Therefore, to improve PVSC operational stability effectively and eliminate/minimize Pb 2+
leakage from the degraded perovskite absorbers, an integrated solution with proper materials and device configurations is required to enable PVSCs for practical applications. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have been recently explored in the perovskite photovoltaic community due to their potential for enhancing photovoltaic performance 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 . This stems from the relative ease in tuning their functionalities as a versatile class of well-defined hybrid materials. So far, there are only very few cases that report the use of MOFs in PVSCs, indicating the very embryonic stage of this area. Among the limited studies, MOFs have been applied as scaffolds to template the growth of perovskites or as additives/surface modifiers to passivate the defects of perovskites for enhancing the device performance and stability 18 , 21 . However, it is challenging to use a MOF as an efficient charge-transporting layer (CTL) because most of them are quite insulating with low carrier mobilities 19 . Additionally, the MOFs utilized in PVSCs are mostly unfunctionalized prototypes that lack the diverse chemical functionalities needed for integrating with PVSCs. To address these problems, we have developed a simple and effective strategy by applying a 2D conjugated MOF that possesses n-type electrical behaviour and suitable energy levels as an electron-extraction layer (EEL) at the perovskite/cathode interface. The use of Zr( iv ) ions to engage selectively the hard carboxyl groups allows dense free-standing thiol arrays to be built around the Zr( iv )–oxo cluster to offer steric shielding and stabilization 22 , 23 . The dense array of thiol groups on the MOF is particularly important because of their capabilities in rigidifying the networks with crosslinked disulfide linkages and in trapping heavy metal ions (such as lead, mercury and so on). In addition, the thiol-functionalized MOF can also form intimate contact with the silver electrode to extract electrons efficiently from PVSCs by reducing the contact resistance and trapping mobile Pb 2+
ions at the perovskite/electrode interface to mitigate the potential impact of the device on environmental sustainability. Characterization of 2D MOF and perovskite/MOF films As shown in Fig.
1a , a new linker molecule H 3 L3
was first synthesized (Supplementary Figs.
1 – 4 ). The peak numbers and assignments in the NMR spectra confirmed the molecular structure of the H 3 L3
linker and indicated the high purity of the H 3 L3
sample used for assembling the Zr( iv )-based MOF product, Zr L3 . The corresponding polycrystalline framework solid, Zr L3
(Fig.
1b ), was then solvothermally prepared, using ZrOCl 2 ∙8H 2 O as the metal source, formic acid as the modulator and ethylene dithiol for stabilizing the thiol groups on the organic linker. The peak S–H stretch at around 2,555 cm −1
can be clearly observed from the FT-IR spectra of both H 3 L3
and Zr L3
(Supplementary Figs.
5
and
6 ), indicating the successfully installed thiol groups in the Zr L3
networks. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of as-made Zr L3
(Supplementary Fig.
7 ) can be indexed onto hexagonal unit cells (parameters:
a  = 19.98 Å,
c  = 7.24 Å (see Supplementary Note
1 ). The short
c
axis suggests a single-layer structure based on Zr 6 O 8
clusters as it compares well with the corresponding interlayer distance in a known structure. Elemental analysis and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results fit the formula Zr 6 O 4 (OH) 4 ( L3 ) 2 (OH) 6 (H 2 O) 27 (DMF) (DMF =
N , N -dimethylformamide) for Zr L3
(Supplementary Fig.
8
and Note
2 ). The linker/Zr 6
cluster ratio thus determined suggests full occupancy for the linker sites in Zr L3 . The capping sites can be occupied by the formate (HCOO − ) and HO − /H 2 O species, but it should be noted that their ratios here cannot be pinpointed by the current data as their small weight fractions do not impact significantly the elemental and TGA results.

h , i , PL ( h ) and TRPL ( i ) spectra of the perovskite films with different EELs. Full size image The morphology, micro and atomic structures of the 2D MOF were also characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The SEM image of Zr L3
features the morphology of thin platelets with dimensions between 100 and 500 nm (Supplementary Fig.
10 ). The low magnification image, fast Fourier transform and electron diffraction show the distinct hexagonal arrays of the 2D layers in Zr L3 , as demonstrated in Supplementary Fig.
11 . Moreover, atomic resolution high angle annular dark field images from aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy indicate the direct (eclipsed) stacking of the MOF layers (Supplementary Fig.
12 ). Individual Zr atoms are seen within the Zr clusters at high magnification. The surface clusters of a thin region were found to be more diffuse compared to the interior. The organic linkers between Zr clusters were seen in the bright field image and the surface of Zr L3
was also shown to be terminated by the organic linkers as in the model (Fig.
1c,d ). TEM studies also suggest superior stability of the 2D networks as Zr L3
was stable under prolonged parallel electron beam radiation (~30 e −
Å −2
s −1 ) while imaging. The stability of the Zr L3
lattice is further verified by gas sorption studies and PXRD. The N 2
sorption isotherm (77 K) features dominant type-I characteristics of microporous solids (Fig.
1e ), with additional uptake at high
P / P 0
regions that can be attributed to capillary condensation in mesopores (for example, arising from the inter-particle/layer spaces). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area is calculated to be 528 m 2
g −1
for Zr L3 , which agrees with the simulated accessible solvent surface of 594 m 2
g −1
(Supplementary Fig.
13 ). To probe respectively the hydrolytic and thermal stability, Zr L3
was placed in boiling water for 24 hours and it was also heated at 100 °C in air for 7 days. The boiling-water-treated sample still showed substantial porosity as per gas sorption studies, even though the surface area was somewhat decreased (369 m 2
g −1 , see also Supplementary Figs.
14
and
15
for the density functional theory analysis of the N 2
sorption data). Moreover, the PXRD pattern of Zr L3
after either boiling-water-treatment or continual heating at 100 °C in air remained strong, indicating the retention of the crystalline phase (Fig.
1f
and Supplementary Fig.
16 ). These results demonstrated the superior moisture and thermal stability of Zr L3 . The optical bandgap of Zr L3
was determined and calculated to be 2.53 eV from its ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflectance spectrum, as shown in Fig.
1g . Additionally, the absorption spectra were also obtained to study the effect of Zr L3
on light harvesting of the perovskite layer (Supplementary Fig.
17 ). No obvious change could be found in the absorption spectra with varied thicknesses of Zr L3
and the bandgap of the mixed-cation (Cs/formamidinium (FA)/methylammonium (MA)) perovskite was calculated to be 1.60 eV from the Tauc plot. The electron- and hole-only devices were fabricated to study the electrical properties of Zr L3
by the space-charge-limited-current method (Supplementary Figs.
18
and
19
and Note
3 ) 24 . As a result, the electron- and hole-mobilities were calculated to be 2.81 × 10 −7
m 2
V −1
s −1
and 5.36 × 10 −9
m 2
V −1
s −1 , respectively. The relatively higher electron mobility indicated that Zr L3
is more of a n-type material, which would be appropriate for extracting electrons in PVSCs. To investigate the interfacial charge carrier dynamics between perovskite and different EELs, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were obtained for the perovskite films coated with Zr L3 , phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC 61 BM) and PC 61 BM/Zr L3
layers, respectively. As can be seen in Fig.
1h , the pure perovskite film showed the strongest PL intensity due to the efficient radiative recombination of the photogenerated carriers, while it was apparently quenched upon contacting with the EELs. We note that the perovskite film showed substantially quenched PL when it contacted with Zr L3 , suggesting efficient charge extraction from perovskite to Zr L3
(ref.
25 , 26 ). This phenomenon is further confirmed by the TRPL spectra, as shown in Fig.
1i
and summarized in Supplementary Table
1 . The perovskite/Zr L3
film exhibited biexponential decay with a fast (1.6 ns) and a slow (13.8 ns) component after being excited by a pulsed laser. This decay is much shorter than for the perovskite-only sample (137.8 and 632.8 ns). In addition, the perovskite/PC 61 BM/Zr L3
film exhibited a slightly faster PL decay than the perovskite/PC 61 BM film, which might be attributed to the cascade energy alignment in perovskite/PC 61 BM/Zr L3
(see Supplementary Fig.
20
and Note
4 ). Device architecture and photovoltaic performance The inverted planar PVSCs with the device configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO) glass/poly(triarylamine) (PTAA)/perovskite/PC 61 BM/EEL/silver (Ag) were fabricated and the corresponding energy alignment is provided in Fig.
2a,b . The device without any EEL showed a relatively low PCE of 18.80% with a fill factor (FF) of 71.21%, which was attributed to the non-ideal electron extraction from PC 61 BM to the electrode and the insufficient hole-blocking ability. Encouragingly, by introducing Zr L3
as the EEL between PC 61 BM and Ag, a much higher FF of 76.42% along with a higher PCE of 20.34% was achieved (Supplementary Figs.
21
and
22 ). These results suggest the enhanced electron extraction and hole-blocking ability originated from Zr L3 , which is consistent with the TRPL results. To extract electrons even more efficiently, a bis-C60 surfactant (previously demonstrated to be able to tune the cathode work function for improving electron extraction in both organic photovoltaic devices and PVSCs (ref.
27 , 28 , 29 , 30 )) was further incorporated with Zr L3
as a hybrid EEL. Although the mobilities of the Zr L3 :bis-C60 hybrid EEL are similar to those of Zr L3 , the reduced energy barrier with the cathode will facilitate electron collection (Supplementary Fig.
23 ). Fig. 2: Device structure and performance of the PVSCs with ZrL3:bis-C60 EEL. a , Device structure of inverted PVSC.

f , PCE histogram obtained from 30 PVSCs with Zr L3 :bis-C60 EEL. Full size image As expected, the PCE of the device with the Zr L3 :bis-C60 EEL (denoted as M-PVSC) could be further increased to 22.02% with an FF of 81.28%, open-circuit voltage ( V oc ) of 1.20 V and negligible hysteresis. This is among the highest values reported for the planar inverted PVSCs (Fig.
2c , Supplementary Figs.
24
and
25
and Table
2 ). The short-circuit current density ( J sc ) obtained from the
J – V
curve matched well with the integrated value from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) (Fig.
2d ), demonstrating the good reliability of the results. The ‘champion’ (best) cell of M-PVSC was further held at the maximum power point (MPP) with a bias voltage of 1.03 V under continuous 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm −2 ) to obtain a stabilized photocurrent of 20.97 mA cm −2 , which corresponds to a stabilized PCE of 21.60% (Fig.
2e ). More importantly, the efficiency of the encapsulated M-PVSC was certified to be 21.3% by an independent accredited institute (the National Institute of Metrology, China), which is close to the value measured in house (Supplementary Fig.
26 ). To elucidate the potential roles Zr L3
and bis-C60 played in the hybrid EEL for device efficiency, the PVSCs using only bis-C60 as the EEL were fabricated as the reference device (denoted as r-PVSC), which affords a slightly lower PCE of 21.32% than that of M-PVSC (Supplementary Fig.
27
and Table
3 ). The device performance of the PVSCs with different EELs is summarized in Fig.
2f
and Supplementary Tables
3 – 5 . There are no obvious enhancements in
V oc
and
J sc , while the enhanced PCE for M-PVSCs mainly comes from the FF improvements (Supplementary Fig.
28 ). To explore the effect of EEL morphology on the improved FF, atomic force microscopy was employed to characterize the morphology of bis-C60, Zr L3
and Zr L3 :bis-C60 prepared on perovskite/PC 61 BM film. The roughness of perovskite/PC 61 BM was slightly reduced from 10.02 to 8.86 nm after coating with bis-C60 (Supplementary Fig.
29 ). By contrast, the film roughness of both perovskite/PC 61 BM/Zr L3
and perovskite/PC 61 BM/Zr L3 :bis-C60 films were increased to 36.31 nm and 35.45 nm, respectively and the morphologies of perovskite/PC 61 BM/Zr L3
and perovskite/PC 61 BM/Zr L3 :bis-C60 were quite similar. These results implied that the film morphology of hybrid EEL was dominated by Zr L3
and it should not be the reason for the varied FF between the devices with different EELs. Furthermore, given that the hole-blocking ability of the EEL can significantly affect the FF in photovoltaic devices, the energy levels of Zr L3 , bis-C60 and Zr L3 :bis-C60 were then calculated and are summarized in Supplementary Table
6
(also Supplementary Figs.
30
and
31
and Note
4 ). It was found that bis-C60 possesses a larger energy barrier for the holes than Zr L3 . Therefore, it can potentially provide better hole-blocking ability which is consistent with the higher FF observed in r-PVSC than the devices with Zr L3
EEL alone. On the other hand, it is known that the thiol group can interact with Ag by forming S–Ag bonds, which can reduce the contact resistance at the interface 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 . Thus, it is expected that the S–Ag bonds would form between the dense thiol and disulfide groups in Zr L3
and the Ag electrode to enable M-PVSCs to have better EEL-Ag contact than r-PVSCs. This allows M-PVSCs to have lower contact resistance and higher FF, which is consistent with our previous report 33 . Based on these considerations, the high efficiency achieved for M-PVSCs should be mainly attributed to bis-C60, while Zr L3
with the dense thiol groups plays a role in reducing the contact resistance, thus slightly improving the FF. The resultant PVSCs were also characterized by light intensity ( I ) dependent photovoltage and photocurrent density. Supplementary Fig.
32
shows the linear relationships between
J sc
and
I
in double-logarithmic scale and the fitted
α
values are close to 1, which demonstrates the efficient carrier transport and the few bimolecular recombinations for both devices. Additionally, the slopes were calculated from the semi-natural logarithmic plot of
V oc
versus
I . The M-PVSC exhibited a slightly lower slope (1.41
k B T/ q ) than r-PVSC (1.57
k B T/ q ), where
k B , T and
q
are Boltzmann’s constant, absolute temperature and elementary charge, respectively. These results indicate that the trap-assisted Shockley–Read–Hall recombination is reduced in M-PVSC because of the better contact between Zr L3
and the Ag electrode, which contributes to faster charge extraction in M-PVSC. In a real-use scenario, perovskites and CTLs in a complete PVSC are susceptible to hydration and oxidation due to abundant moisture and an oxygen atmosphere 35 , 36 , 37 . To highlight the superior stability of Zr L3 , perovskite/PC 61 BM films were prepared initially on glass and coated with either bis-C60 or Zr L3 :bis-C60 hybrid EEL to investigate their ability to protect perovskites against moisture and oxygen. The perovskite/PC 61 BM film with only bis-C60 EEL bleached almost completely after being placed in an ambient environment with a relative humidity (RH) of 75% for over two weeks (Supplementary Fig.
33 ). In sharp contrast, no obvious degradation was observed for the perovskite/PC 61 BM film protected by the Zr L3 :bis-C60 hybrid EEL. Besides, the contact angle with a drop of water on top of Zr L3 :bis-C60 protected perovskite/PC 61 BM film rose from 68.37 to 81.23° (Supplementary Fig.
34 ), implying Zr L3
can indeed help prevent moisture from penetrating into perovskite film, which is consistent with its enhanced film stability. Long-term device stability To verify the feasibility of using a Zr L3 :bis-C60 EEL in enhancing device stability, a comprehensive study was carried out on the encapsulated PVSCs in both humid air and nitrogen atmosphere. The M-PVSC showed superior shelf stability in an ambient environment (with a RH of 75%), maintaining 90% of its initial efficiency after 1,100 hours (Fig.
3a ). By contrast, the PCE of r-PVSC dropped significantly to <50% of its original value. The significantly enhanced stability can be attributed to the strong coordinating ability of Zr( iv ) ions and the dense thiol and crosslinked disulfide linkages in Zr L3 , which protect perovskites against moisture and oxygen 38 .

f , Schematic of degradation process of PVSCs and the immobilization effect of Zr L3
on leaked Pb 2+
ions. Full size image Long-term operational stability of the devices was tested under a white LED lamp with the light intensity equivalent to 1 sun in a N 2 -filled glovebox (Fig.
3b ). Specifically, the operational stability was tested under an accelerated ageing condition: (1) no UV filter for the light source and (2) the devices were monitored at an elevated temperature of 85 °C to estimate their potential for long-term stability. The Zr L3 -incorporated cell was tracked at the MPP and the corresponding PCEs obtained from the
J – V
curve were constantly monitored during the test (Fig.
3c ). The PCE of M-PVSC only dropped slightly to 92% of its initial value after 1,000 hours of ageing. Thus, M-PVSC is among the most stable inverted PVSCs tested under the MPP tracking condition at 85 °C. Moreover, it is observed that the constantly recorded PCEs from the
J – V
curves of M-PVSC during MPP tracking showed a similar decay trend, demonstrating the good reliability of the testing (Fig.
3c ). In the literature, small-molecule based CTLs/EELs tend to crystallize and form aggregates under thermal stress. This creates pathways for direct interactions between perovskite and metal electrode and so impairs the device performance 37 . The superior stability of Zr L3
under thermal stress significantly enhanced the thermal stability of M-PVSC, which was further verified by the stability profile of the PVSCs with only Zr L3
as the EEL (Supplementary Fig.
35 ). Lead contamination of PVSCs To probe the possible sources and mechanisms that cause the degradation in our devices, the depth profiles of Pb, Ag and I ions throughout the un-encapsulated PVSCs were investigated by using time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) (Fig.
3d,e ). The Pb 2+
signal could be clearly observed to shift towards the Ag electrode through the electron-transporting layer in the r-PVSC after it was aged under the accelerated condition in air (85 °C and 85% RH). This indicates that the perovskite films can be easily decomposed into Pb-containing by-products and ammonium salts under such an aggressive ageing condition, resulting in Pb 2+
diffusion into other layers 35 , 39 . Very encouragingly, almost no Pb 2+
ions could be detected in the Ag layer of M-PVSC and they were “trapped” at the Zr L3 :bis-C60/Ag interface to form Pb( ii )–Zr L3
complexes. Unlike the physical encapsulation methods used in reducing lead leakage, this in situ chemical adsorption of Pb 2+
by Zr L3 :bis-C60 EEL in the device is a much more effective and sustainable process for long-term practical applications (Fig.
3f ). To quantify the adsorption ability of Zr L3
for Pb 2+
ions, sorption kinetics and sorption isotherm measurements were obtained (Fig.
4a,b
and Supplementary Notes
5
and
6 ). A distribution coefficient
K d
of around 10 5
ml g −1 , a substantial value of 355 mg g −1
for the Pb adsorption capacity ( q max ) and a sorption rate constant (pseudo first-order) of 0.103 min −1
were achieved. These results strongly support the idea that Zr L3
EEL can effectively adsorb Pb 2+
by rapid chemical reactions between thiols and Pb 2+
to minimize the leakage of Pb 2+
ions into the environment. To investigate the lead leakage that occurred in the degraded PVSCs, they were immersed in deionized water with a pH value of ~5.6 (simulating acidic rain) to compare the concentration of water soluble Pb components between M-PVSCs and r-PVSCs, as shown in Fig.
4c . Pb 2+
testing paper was used to perform a quick check on the Pb 2+
concentration in the contaminated water and it was found that the aqueous extracts from the r-PVSC showed a much higher Pb 2+
concentration compared with those of the M-PVSC. Fig. 4: Lead contamination of the PVSCs with bis-C60 (r-PVSC) or ZrL3:bis-C60 (M-PVSC) EEL. a , Pb( ii ) sorption kinetics of an activated Zr L3

c , Degraded PVSCs with bis-C60 (r-PVSC) or Zr L3 :bis-C60 (M-PVSC) EEL are immersed into the deionized water with a pH value of ~5.6 and Pb ion testing paper is used to quickly detect the Pb concentration in the contaminated water.
d , Pb concentration in the contaminated water was accurately detected by ICP-OES measurements. Full size image An inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) instrument was further used to quantify accurately the Pb 2+
concentrations (Fig.
4d
and Supplementary Fig.
36 ). The Pb 2+
concentration decreased drastically to an average value of 7.6 ppm for M-PVSCs compared to 38.4 ppm for r-PVSCs and 38.1 ppm for pure perovskite film, which means over 80% of the leaked Pb 2+
ions from the degraded perovskite could be captured by thiol-functionalized Zr L3
to form water-insoluble Pb( ii )–Zr L3
complexes. This substantially reduced lead leakage was attributed to the chemical reaction between the dense array of thiol and disulfide groups on Zr L3
with leaked Pb 2+
ions from the degraded perovskites. Although this Pb( ii )-trapping process can be further optimized, our results demonstrate a promising strategy to improve simultaneously PVSC long-term operational stability and reduce/prevent Pb 2+
leakage into the environment. This will greatly facilitate the large-scale deployment of highly efficient PVSCs for clean energy applications. Conclusion We have developed an effective strategy to address simultaneously the most challenging operational stability and lead contamination issues in PVSCs by incorporating a functionalized 2D MOF as an EEL into a PVSC. The resultant inverted PVSC achieved a high PCE of >22% (a certified value of 21.3%) and substantially improved long-term operational stability. More importantly, the thiol-containing MOF can capture most of the leaked Pb 2+
(over 80%) from degraded PVSCs by forming a water-insoluble complex. These combined results showed the promise of simultaneously realizing stable and environmental-friendly PVSCs through multi-functional MOFs.

(30 mg, 0.048 mmol) and 10 drops of 1,2-ethanedithiol (170 mg, 1.81 mmol) were dissolved in DMF (3.0 ml), while ZrOCl 2 ∙8H 2 O (92 mg, 0.29 mmol) and formic acid (≥ 88%, 490 mg, 9.37 mmol) were ultrasonically dissolved in another 3.0 ml DMF. The two mixtures were added to a 25 ml Pyrex glass ampoule. The ampoule was flame-sealed and heated in an oven at 120 °C for 48 h, followed by programmed cooling to room temperature for 12 h. The pale brown powder formed was collected by filtration, then washed with DMF (3 ml × 10) and acetone (3 ml × 10) and dried under nitrogen flow for weight measurement (90 mg). The above powder was denoted as as-made Zr L3 . Preparation of activated ZrL3 In a nitrogen-filled glovebox, an as-made Zr L3
sample (~80 mg) and DMF (~8 ml) were added to a 15 ml glass vial and heated at 60 °C for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the supernatant was replaced with fresh DMF (~8 ml) and heated at 60 °C for 12 h. The above solvent exchange and heating procedures were repeated three times. After that, the above activation procedure was repeated using CH 3 CN. The vacuum-dried powder was denoted as activated Zr L3 . Elemental analysis found (C (26.70%), H (4.286%), N (0.47%)) and a fitting formula can be determined to be Zr 6 O 4 (OH) 4 ( L3 ) 2 (OH) 6 (H 2 O) 27 (DMF) (molecular mass 2,596.45), which gives a calculated profile as (C (26.37%), H (3.92%), N (0.54%), S (14.82%), Zr (21.08%)). The activated Zr L3
sample was also characterized by TGA in both N 2
and air flows (Supplementary Fig.
8 , see also Supplementary Fig.
9
for an informative comparison of TGA data). The TGA measurement conducted in an air flow showed 25.1% ZrO 2
residue, equivalent to a Zr content of 18.6%. Both TGA and elemental analysis results agree with the evacuated, dehydrated formula Zr 6 O 8 (C 27 H 15 O 6 S 6 ) 2 O (molecular mass 1947). Boiling-water-treatment of ZrL3 To a 100 ml round-bottom flask charged with a stirring bar, an activated Zr L3
sample (120 mg) and deionized water (30 ml) were added and the mixture was refluxed (using an oil bath at 120 °C) for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature, the resultant MOF solid was collected by filtration and dried under vacuum at 105 °C for 12 h. The above powder was denoted as boiling-water-treated Zr L3 . Perovskite solar cell fabrication The pre-patterned ITO (15 Ω sq −1 ) glass substrates were sequentially cleaned by sonication with detergent (Decon 90/deionized water, v/v = 1:1), deionized water, acetone and IPA for 15 min, respectively. The cleaned ITO glass substrates were then transferred into an oven at a temperature of 100 °C and treated with O 2
plasma for 10 min before use. Then, the hole-transporting layer, that is, 10 mg ml −1
PTAA in toluene (doped with 1 wt% of 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ)), was spin-coated onto the ITO glass substrate at 4,000 rpm for 30 s and this was subsequently annealed at 150 °C for 10 min. After cooling for 5 min, the mixed-cation perovskite film was then deposited on PTAA by a one-step spin-coating method. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by mixing CsI, FAI, MABr, PbI 2
and PbBr 2
in DMF/DMSO (v/v = 5:1) to a chemical formula of Cs 0.05 (FA 0.85 MA 0.15 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3 . Considering the poor wetting ability of the PTAA surface, 50 μl DMF was first spun onto the PTAA layer to improve the wetting ability before depositing the perovskite layer. Then, 60 μl of perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated on PTAA at 1,000 rpm for 10 s and 5,000 rpm for 30 s. During the second step, 110 μl CB as anti-solvent was quickly dripped onto the centre of the perovskite film 15 s before the end of the spin-coating process and then annealed at 60 °C for 5 min and 100 °C for 30 min. The electron-transporting layer, that is PC 61 BM (20 mg ml −1
in CB), was spun onto the perovskite layer with a speed of 2,000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 90 °C for 10 min. As for the devices with a MOF EEL, Zr L3
solution was first prepared by dispersing Zr L3
into IPA at different concentrations followed by ultrasonication and stirring. Then, the Zr L3
(or Zr L3
doped with 10 wt% of bis-C60) solution was spun onto the PC 61 BM layer at a speed of 2,000 rpm for 60 s. For the reference devices, bis-C60 (2 mg ml −1
in IPA) was spun onto the PC 61 BM with a speed of 2,000 rpm for 30 s. All the spin-coating processes were conducted in a N 2 -filled glovebox with contents of O 2
and H 2 O < 1 ppm at a controlled temperature of 20–25 °C. Finally, 120 nm Ag was thermally evaporated in a high vacuum chamber (<5 × 10 −6
Torr) through a metal shadow mask (aperture area of 0.13 cm 2
is defined by the overlap between the pre-patterned ITO and the back metal electrode). Characterizations and measurements Elemental analysis was performed with a Vario EL III CHN elemental analyser. Infrared spectra in the range 400–4,000 cm −1
were recorded on a Nicolet Avatar 360 FT-IR spectrophotometer. Solution
1 H NMR and
13 C NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature on Bruker superconducting-magnet high-field NMR spectrometers with working frequencies of 300 and 400 MHz, using tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. Chemical shifts ( δ ) are expressed in ppm relative to the residual solvent reference (for example chloroform - d
1 H: 7.26 ppm,
13 C: 77.0 ppm). Coupling constants are expressed in hertz. TGA was carried out in a nitrogen or air stream using Perkin Elmer thermal analysis equipment (STA 6000) with a heating rate of 2 °C min −1 , with an empty Al 2 O 3
crucible being used as the reference. The porosity and surface area analyses were performed using a Quantachrome Autosorb iQ gas sorption analyser. Samples were outgassed at 0.03 Torr with a 2 °C min −1
ramp to 120 °C and held at 120 °C for 12 h. The samples were then held in vacuum until the analyses started to run. Pore analysis was performed using N 2
at 77.35 K ( P / P 0
range of 2 × 10 −7 –0.995). PXRD data were collected in the reflection mode at room temperature on a Philips X’Pert diffractometer equipped with a CPS 180 detector using monochromated Cu-Kα ( λ  = 1.5418 Å) radiation. The X-ray tube operated at a voltage of 30 kV and a current of 30 mA. The amounts of the metal ions were determined using a PerkinElmer Optima™ 8000 ICP-OES instrument. Scanning transmission electron microscopy images were obtained on a double-aberration-corrected JEOL JEM-300CF instrument at 300 kV. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer UV-vis spectrometer (model Lambda 2S). PL and TRPL spectra were recorded on an FLS980 spectrofluorometer (Edinburgh Instruments) with a Xe lamp and a pulsed excitation laser, respectively. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectrum studies were carried out on a VG ESCALAB 220i-XL surface analysis system equipped with a He discharge lamp ( hv  = 21.22 eV). The morphology of the samples was monitored by SEM (QUATTRO S, Thermal Fisher Scientific). Atomic force microscopy was carried out using a Nanoscope IIIa instrument (Veeco). Cyclic voltammetry was measured on a CH Instruments CHI760E electrochemical analyser/workstation using a conventional three-electrode cell with an ITO strip (5 mm × 35 mm) coated with Zr L3
as the working electrode, a Pt wire counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode at a scan rate of 50 mV s −1
using 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate in dry DCM as the electrolyte and referenced to the FeCp 2 /FeCp 2 +
(FeCp 2  = Fe(C 5 H 5 ) 2 ) redox couple (−5.10 eV below vacuum level) 40 . The working electrode was prepared using a similar method as reported in the literature 41
by casting a dispersion of Zr L3
in isopropanol onto the ITO glass. ToF-SIMS measurement was perfomed using a TOF-SIMS V instrument (ION‐TOF GmbH, Cameca IMS 4F), where a 3 keV Cs +
ion beam was used for erosion and a 25 keV Bi +
pulsed primary ion beam was used for the analysis. The area of analysis was 48 × 48 µm 2
while the sputtering area was 300 × 300 µm 2 . The current density–voltage ( J – V)
characteristics of the photovoltaic devices were measured in a N 2 -filled glovebox at room temperature using a Keithley 2400 SourceMeter under simulated sunlight from a solar simulator (EnliTech, SS-F5). A National Renewable Energy Laboratory calibrated silicon solar cell (with a KG-2 filter) was used to obtain the AM 1.5G (100 mW cm −2 ) light intensity from the solar simulator. The PVSCs were covered with a shading mask with an aperture area of 0.104 cm 2
to ensure the accuracy of the current density obtained from the
J – V
curves. The
J – V
measurements were carried out in sweep mode with reverse (from 1.23 V to −0.02 V) and forward (from −0.02 V to 1.23 V) scans with a scan rate of 10 mV s −1 . EQE was carried out using an EQE measurement system (EnliTech, QE-R). Reporting Summary Further information on research design is available in the

Abstract Metal halide perovskites of the general formula ABX 3 —where A is a monovalent cation such as caesium, methylammonium or formamidinium; B is divalent lead, tin or germanium; and X is a halide anion—have shown great potential as light harvesters for thin-film photovoltaics 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . Among a large number of compositions investigated, the cubic α-phase of formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI 3 ) has emerged as the most promising semiconductor for highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , and maximizing the performance of this material in such devices is of vital importance for the perovskite research community. Here we introduce an anion engineering concept that uses the pseudo-halide anion formate (HCOO − ) to suppress anion-vacancy defects that are present at grain boundaries and at the surface of the perovskite films and to augment the crystallinity of the films. The resulting solar cell devices attain a power conversion efficiency of 25.6 per cent (certified 25.2 per cent), have long-term operational stability (450 hours) and show intense electroluminescence with external quantum efficiencies of more than 10 per cent. Our findings provide a direct route to eliminate the most abundant and deleterious lattice defects present in metal halide perovskites, providing a facile access to solution-processable films with improved optoelectronic performance.

Reduction of bulk and surface defects in inverted methylammonium- and bromide-free formamidinium perovskite solar cells

03 July 2023
Main Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much attention since their first demonstration in 2009 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . The rapid expansion of research into PSCs has been driven by their low-cost solution processing and attractive optoelectronic properties, including a tunable bandgap 6 , high absorption coefficient 10 , low recombination rate 11
and high mobility of charge carriers 12 . Within a decade, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction PSCs progressed from 3% to a certified value of 25.5% 13 , the highest value obtained for thin-film photovoltaics. Moreover, through the use of additive and interface engineering strategies, the long-term operational stability of PSCs now exceeds 1,000 hours in full sunlight 14 , 15 . PSCs therefore show great promise for deployment as the next generation of photovoltaics. Compositional engineering plays a key part in achieving highly efficient and stable PSCs. In particular, mixtures of methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI 3 ) with formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI 3 ) have been extensively studied 5 , 7 . Compared to MAPbI 3 , FAPbI 3
is thermally more stable and has a bandgap closer to the Shockley–Queisser limit 6 , rendering FAPbI 3
the most attractive perovskite layer for single-junction PSCs. Unfortunately, thin FAPbI 3
films undergo a phase transition from the black α-phase to a photoinactive yellow δ-phase below a temperature of 150 °C. Previous approaches to overcome this problem have included mixing FAPbI 3
with a combination of methylammonium (MA + ), caesium (Cs + ) and bromide (Br − ) ions; however, this comes at the cost of blue-shifted absorbance and phase segregation under operational conditions 7 , 8 , 9 , 16 . Nevertheless, α-FAPbI 3
has recently emerged as the candidate of choice for highly efficient and stable PSCs 9 , 17 , 18 . We have previously prepared α-FAPbI 3
by spin-coating a precursor solution of FAPbI 3
mixed with excess methylammonium chloride (MACl), and achieved a certified efficiency of 23.48% for the resulting mesoporous FAPbI 3
PSC 17 . By fully exploiting the absorption spectrum of FAPbI 3
together with proper light management, a certified efficiency of 23.73% was reported 18 —approaching the theoretical maximum—with a short-circuit current density ( J sc ) of 26.7 mA cm −2 . However, the open-circuit voltage ( V oc ) of around 1.15 V for FAPbI 3
PSCs still lags behind the radiative limit 9 , 18 , which suggests that more work is needed to further reduce the density of defects in the FAPbI 3
perovskite films to suppress the non-radiative recombination of charge carriers. Bromide, chloride (Cl − ) and thiocyanate (SCN − ) anions have commonly been used to improve the crystallinity and stability of perovskite films 8 , 9 , 11 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 . Another pseudo-halide anion, formate (HCOO − ), has also been investigated in connection with MAPbI 3
PSCs 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 . Two studies 23 , 24
reported that MAHCOO improves the quality of MAPbI 3
films by controlling the growth of the perovskite crystals, while others 25 , 26
reported that formic acid accelerates the crystallization of perovskites based on MA cations. Previous work has therefore mainly dealt with the effect of formate on the morphology, nucleation and growth of MAPbI 3 . There has also been a recent report of a highly fluorescent methylammonium lead bromide and formate mixture in water 27 . However, a fundamental understanding of the effects of formate on perovskite films has yet to be achieved. Here we uncover the key role of HCOO −
anions in removing halide vacancies, which are the predominant lattice defects in FAPbI 3
perovskite films. This enables the PCE of the PSC to exceed 25%, combined with a high operational stability and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of electroluminescence (EQE EL ) that exceeds 10%. Iodide vacancies are also the principal cause of the unwanted ionic conductivity of metal halide perovskites, which has deleterious effect on their operational stability. We provide insight into the mode of formate intervention. Formate is small enough to fit into the iodide vacancy 22 , thereby eliminating a prevalent and notorious defect in the metal halide perovskite that accelerates the non-radiative recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, in turn decreasing both the fill factor and the
V oc
of a solar cell. We generated FAPbI 3
perovskite films with improved crystallinity and larger grain size by introducing 2% formamidine formate (FAHCOO) into the precursor solution. The defect passivation and the improved crystallinity are essential to attain the levels of efficiency and stability that are demonstrated by our FAPbI 3 -based PSCs. Characterization of the perovskite films The reference FAPbI 3
film, hereafter denoted ‘reference’, was prepared as previously reported using a precursor solution containing a mixture of FAPbI 3
powder with 35 mol% additional MACl 17 . For the formate-doped FAPbI 3
(Fo-FAPbI 3 ) film,
x
mol% ( x  ≤ 4) FAHCOO was added to the reference precursor solution (for experimental details, see Supplementary Information). At a later stage in this work, we quantify the amount of MA in the resulting perovskite material to be 5%, but for simplicity we refer to this sample as FAPbI 3 . Figure
1a
shows the ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption and photoluminescence spectra of the FAPbI 3
perovskite films ( x
= 0, 2 and 4). The absorption threshold and photoluminescence peak position were identical for all films; however, there was an obvious decrease in absorbance for the 4% Fo-FAPbI 3
film. We derived a bandgap of 1.53 eV for the films using the Tauc plot (Extended Data Fig.
1a ). Fig.
1b
shows the time-resolved photoluminescence of the FAPbI 3
perovskite films. The 2% Fo-FAPbI 3
perovskite film showed a slower photoluminescence decay than the reference, which indicates a reduced non-radiative recombination rate due to a reduction in trap-mediated bulk or surface recombination. By contrast, the 4% Fo-FAPbI 3
perovskite film showed a faster photoluminescence decay than the reference. A full photoluminescence decay up to 4 μs is shown in Extended Data Fig.
1b . A quantitative analysis of the time-resolved photoluminescence is presented in Supplementary Note  1 . Fig. 1: Characterization of the FAPbI 3
films. a , UV–vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the FAPbI 3

1c ), the 2% Fo-FAPbI 3
film (Fig.
1d ) had a slightly larger grain size of up to 2 μm (Extended Data Fig.
1c ). The insets of Fig.
1c, d
show the cross-sectional SEM images of the corresponding perovskite films. Both the reference and 2% Fo-FAPbI 3
films showed monolithic grains from the top to the bottom. Extended Data Fig.
1d, e
shows the irregular grain size of the 4% Fo-FAPbI 3
films. Atomic force microscopy measurements (Extended Data Fig.
1f, g ) revealed a surface roughness of 41.66 nm and 57.47 nm for the reference and 2% Fo-FAPbI 3
films, respectively. The slightly increased surface roughness of the 2% Fo-FAPbI 3
film is probably due to the slightly increased grain size. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements (Extended Data Fig.
1h ) showed identical peak positions at around 13.95° and 27.85° for both the reference and the Fo-FAPbI 3
perovskite films, corresponding to the α-phase of FAPbI 3 . However, the XRD pattern of the 4% Fo-FAPbI 3
film showed additional peaks, which are assigned to fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates and different orientations of α-FAPbI 3 . The broader and lower-intensity diffraction peaks—resulting in a higher relative noise level—indicate a poor crystallinity, which is consistent with the poor optical measurements of the 4% Fo-FAPbI 3
film described above. Synchrotron-based two-dimensional grazing-incidence XRD measurements were also obtained for the FAPbI 3
films at a relative humidity of around 100% at 30 °C in air. Figure
1e
clearly shows the presence of the δ-phase in the reference, whereas this phase was absent in the 2% Fo-FAPbI 3
film (Fig.
1f ). This provides strong evidence that FAHCOO stabilizes the α-phase of FAPbI 3
against humidity. In addition, the full-width at half-maximum of the α-phase peak was decreased for the 2% Fo-FAPbI 3
film, which is hereafter denoted as ‘target’. The integrated one-dimensional diffraction intensity is shown in Extended Data Fig.
1i . We infer from these data that including 2% FAHCOO in the synthesis of the FAPbI 3
films strongly enhances their crystallinity. We obtained solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy measurements in order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that lead to the improvements afforded by the HCOO −
anions. We prepared the samples by mixing formamidinium iodide and PbI 2
powders with 5 mol% excess FAHCOO using a mechano-synthesis method. Experimental details are provided in Methods. The
207 Pb spectrum is sensitive to the nature of the anions that are coordinated to Pb 2+
in the perovskite crystal 28 . Figure
2a
shows the
207 Pb NMR spectrum of α-FAPbI 3 , in which the
207 Pb resonance appears at 1,543 ppm. The addition of 5% FABr results in a notable shoulder on the low-frequency side of the resonance, as shown in Fig.
2a
(2). This shoulder corresponds to
207 Pb in a [PbBrI 5 ] site, which resonates at lower frequency than in a [PbI 6 ] site, because
207 Pb in a [PbBr 6 ] site in FAPbBr 3
resonates at 510 ppm 28 . However, the
207 Pb resonance of α-FAPbI 3
remained the same even when 5% FAHCOO was added during the synthesis, which is strong evidence that HCOO −
does not substitute for iodide anions in the α-FAPbI 3
lattice. This is also supported by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the formation energy (Supplementary Note  2 ). Fig. 2: Solid-state NMR spectra and molecular dynamics simulations. a ,

d , The relative interaction strengths of different anions with the I −
vacancy at the surface. Full size image To explore the local environment of the HCOO −
anions in the Fo-FAPbI 3
perovskite,
1 H– 13 C cross-polarization experiments
29
were performed at 100 K. Figure
2b
(1) shows
13 C resonance signals at 167.8 ppm and 158.5 ppm for the HCOO −
and FA +
environments in FAHCOO, respectively. Figure
2b , (2) and (3) show the δ-FAPbI 3
and α-FAPbI 3
and
13 C resonances at 157.6 ppm and 153.4 ppm, respectively. Upon mixing 5 mol% FAHCOO with FAPbI 3 , the
13 C signal of α-FAPbI 3
remained unchanged at 153.4 ppm (Fig.
2b
(4)); this further corroborates the lack of substitution of iodide by HCOO −
inside the FAPbI 3
lattice, which would broaden the
13 C resonance of FAPbI 3 . The HCOO −
peak, however, exhibited considerable broadening—indicative of a distribution of local environments—in contrast to the well-defined environment in crystalline FAHCOO. This is consistent with interaction of the HCOO −
anion with undercoordinated Pb 2+
to passivate iodide vacancies that are present at the surface or the grain boundaries of the perovskite, as predicted by molecular dynamics simulations (see below). For the spin-coated target thin films, the formate
13 C signal is less intense, appearing as a shoulder on the α-FAPbI 3
peak (Extended Data Fig.
2a, b ). This is due to a combination of the lower initial formate concentration and—because the exposed area is greater—the potentially greater evaporation of formate during annealing in the thin films compared to that in the powders; however, it should be noted that cross-polarization spectra are not quantitative. The presence of FAHCOO in the α-FAPbI 3
films is also supported by the time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry measurements (Extended Data Fig.
2c, d ). We further quantified the composition of the spin-coated target films using directly detected
13 C NMR at 100 K (Extended Data Fig.
2e ). Integration of the FA +
and MA +
resonances in the quantitative
13 C spectrum yields a concentration of MA +
in the final film of 5.1% (Supplementary Note  3 ). Fig. 3: Characterization of the photovoltaic performance of the FAPbI 3

anions, we performed ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of a homogeneous mixture of different ions in the precursor solution (see Extended Data Fig.
3a, b
and Supplementary Note  4 )—comprising Pb 2+ , I − , HCOO −
and FA + —and found that HCOO −
anions coordinate strongly with Pb 2+
cations (Supplementary Video  1 ). This strong coordination might help to slow the growth process, resulting in larger stacked grains of the perovskite film; this is validated by the in situ images of the perovskite films without annealing (Supplementary Fig.
1 ). Compared to the reference film, the target film showed a slower colour change from brown to black. We also performed molecular dynamics simulations to understand the surface passivation effects of HCOO −
anions. Extended Data Fig.
3c
shows a super cell of a α-FAPbI 3
perovskite slab, in which surface iodides are replaced by formate anions. We found that HCOO −
anions can form a hydrogen-bonded network with FA +
ions (Extended Data Fig.
3d , Supplementary Video  2 ), in agreement with the hydrogen bonding that is observed in FAHCOO crystal structures 30 . In addition, HCOO −
anions can also form a bonding network on the Pb 2+
ion-terminated surface, owing to their strong affinity towards lead (Extended Data Fig.
3e , Supplementary Video  3 ). Figure
2c
shows a calculated structure that illustrates an HCOO −
anion passivating an I −
vacancy at the FAPbI 3
surface. I −
vacancy defects are the most deleterious defects for halide perovskites. They act as electron traps—inducing the non-radiative recombination of charge carriers—and are responsible for the ionic conductivity of perovskites that causes operational instability. We estimated the relative binding affinities of different anions to I −
vacancies at the surface (Extended Data Fig.
4 ).The energies shown in Fig.
2d
reveal that HCOO −
has the highest binding energy to I −
vacant sites in comparison with Cl − , Br − , I −
and BF 4 − . Furthermore, we also calculated the bonding energies of FA +
cations at the interface with HCOO −
anions and with other anions (Extended Data Fig.
5 , Supplementary Note  5 ). We found that FA +
cations at the interface form stronger bonds with HCOO −
than with the other anions. We therefore conclude that the HCOO −
anion acts by eliminating anion-vacancy defects. Photovoltaic performance of the PSCs We further explored the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs. FAPbI 3
PSCs were fabricated using a configuration as illustrated in Fig.
3a . Figure
3b
shows current density ( J )–voltage ( V ) curves of the reference and target PSCs under both forward and reverse scans. The reference cell had a maximum PCE of 23.92% with a
J sc
of 25.72 mA cm −2 , a
V oc
of 1.153 V and a fill factor of 80.69%. The target PSC had a maximum PCE of 25.59% with a
J sc
of 26.35 mA cm −2 , a
V oc
of 1.189 V and a fill factor of 81.7%. The detailed parameters are summarized in Extended Data Table
1 . A statistical distribution of the measured PCE of the reference and target PSCs are shown in Fig.
3c . To verify the efficiency, we sent one of our best target PSCs to an accredited photovoltaic test laboratory (Newport, USA) for certification. Supplementary Fig.
2
represents a certified quasi-steady-state efficiency of 25.21%, with a
V oc
of 1.174 V, a
J sc
of 26.25 mA cm −2
and a fill factor of 81.8%. EQE measurements (Fig.
3d ) were performed to verify the measured
J sc . The EQE of the target cell was higher than that of the reference cell over the whole visible-light absorption region. By integrating the EQE over the AM 1.5G standard spectrum, the projected
J sc
of the reference and target PSCs are 25.75 mA cm −2
and 26.35 mA cm −2 , respectively, which well match the measured
J sc
under the solar simulator. Figure
3e
shows the EQE EL
of the PSCs. It is known that the photovoltage of a solar cell is directly related to the ability to extract its internal luminescence 31 . EQE EL
values have previously been successfully used to predict the
V oc
of PSCs 32 . In this case, the EQE EL
of the reference cell was 2.2%, whereas that of the target cell was 10.1% for injection current densities of 25.5 mA cm −2
and 26.5 mA cm −2
(corresponding to the
J sc
measured under 1 sun illumination), respectively. Treatment with formate therefore results in a fivefold reduction in the non-radiative recombination rate. The
V oc
of 1.21 V that we obtained for the target cell (Extended Data Fig.
6a ) is 96% of the Shockley–Queisser limit of 1.25 V 32 , 33 —to our knowledge, this is the highest value yet obtained. To further confirm the role of formate, we also measured the performance of devices fabricated using formamidinium acetate as an additive (Extended Data Fig.
6b ); however, this additive had a negative effect on performance. For the devices fabricated without MACl additives or passivation layers, those that contained formate still showed an advantage (Extended Data Fig.
6c, d ). Supplementary Fig.
3
shows a linear relationship (with a slope of approximately 0.95) between
J sc
and light intensity for both the reference and target PSCs—indicating good charge transport and negligible bimolecular recombination—and Fig.
3f
shows a linear relationship between
V oc
and the logarithm of light intensity. We fitted the data points with a slope of
η id k B T / q , where
η id
is the ideality factor,
k B
is the Boltzmann constant,
T
is temperature and
q
is the electron charge. The reference cell had an
η id
of 1.52, whereas that of the target cell was 1.18—lower than the previously reported value 33
of 1.27. A summary of the detailed photovoltaic parameters can be found in Extended Data Table
2 . The reduction in
η id , as well as the space-charge-limited current measurements (Supplementary Fig.
4 ), further support our findings of a reduction in trap-assisted recombination 34 , 35 . Because the fill factor critically depends 36
on
η id , the reduction in
η id
that we observe here also contributes to the increase in fill factor measured for the target PSCs. Shelf-life and operational stability of the PSCs To assess the stability of our PSCs, we measured first their shelf life by storing the unencapsulated devices in the dark at 25 °C and 20% relative humidity. Figure
4a
shows that the PCE of the reference cell decreased by about 35% after 1,000 h aging, whereas the target cell showed a degradation of only 10% over this time. A heat-stability test was also performed by annealing the unencapsulated PSC devices at 60 °C under 20% relative humidity. Figure
4b
shows that the target cell retained around 80% of its initial efficiency after 1,000 h aging, whereas the reference cell retained only about 40%. Fig. 4: Stability of the FAPbI3 PSCs. a , The shelf-life stability of the reference and target PSCs.
b , The heat stability of the reference and target PSCs.
c , The operational stability of the reference and target PSCs, showing high performance.
d , The long-term operational stability of the reference and target PSCs. Full size image We further investigated the operational stability of the PSCs by aging the unencapsulated devices under a nitrogen atmosphere, using maximum power point (MPP) tracking under a simulated 1-sun illumination. Figure
4c
shows the PCE of the PSCs under continuous light soaking using a xenon lamp. The PCE of the target cell remained above 24% after 10-h MPP tracking, whereas that of the reference cell decreased to 22.8%. Figure
4d
shows the long-term operational stability of the PSCs. The PCE of the reference cell decreased by about 30%, whereas the target cell only lost around 15% of its initial efficiency. Note that during this experiment the temperature of the PSCs was measured to be around 35 °C, as we did not cool the cells during illumination. Compared to the target PSC, the reference cell showed a considerable decrease in
J sc
and fill factor over the 450-h MPP tracking test (Extended Data Fig.
7 ), which suggests that reference perovskite layer is less stable. We attribute the decline in fill factor to a de-doping of the hole conductor due to Li +
ion migration under illumination 37 . The improvement in thermal and operational stability of the target cell compared with the reference cell is ascribed to the better crystallinity of the perovskite film and a reduced concentration of halide defects, because NMR experiments show that formate is not incorporated into the bulk of the perovskite. It is known that crystallinity is crucial for the stability of the perovskites, because the main degradation process starts from defects near the grain boundaries. The high crystallinity and large grain size of the formate-containing perovskite films—as validated by SEM and XRD measurements—will contribute to their greater stability and performance. Our simulations and calculations suggest that formate anions have the highest binding affinity among all halides and pseudo halides for iodide vacancy sites, and are therefore the best candidates to eliminate the most abundant and deleterious lattice defects present in halide perovskite films. This results in a marked reduction of trap-mediated non-radiative recombination, which we validated by EQE EL , time-resolved photoluminescence,
\(n\) id , and SCLC measurements. A low level of halide vacancies is beneficial for the stability of solar cells, because halide vacancies can lead to degradation as a result of photoinduced iodine loss, especially under light illumination. Overall, we demonstrate α-FAPbI 3 -based PSCs with a PCE of 25.6% (certified 25.2%) and high stability, achieved through solution processing by introducing 2% formamidinium formate into the FAPbI 3
perovskite precursor solution. Our molecular dynamics simulations, together with solid-state NMR spectroscopy analysis and in-depth optoelectronic device characterization, provide an understanding of the role of HCOO −
anions as passivating agents for FAPbI 3
perovskites. Our findings pave the way for facile access to high-performance PSCs approaching their theoretical efficiency limit. Methods Materials Formamidine acetate salt (99%), hydroiodic acid (HI, 57 wt% in water), titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate), 2-propanol (anhydrous, 99.5%), chlorobenzene (anhydrous, 99.8%),
N , N -dimethylformamide (DMF, anhydrous 99.8%,), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, >99.5%), 2-methoxyethanol (anhydrous, 99.8%) and formic acid were procured from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Methylamine hydrochloride (MACl, 98%) was procured from Acros Organics. Fluorine-doped tin oxide on glass (FTO glass, 7 Ω sq –1 ) was obtained from Asahi. Ethanol (absolute, 99.9%) was procured from Changshu Yangyuan Chemicals. Diethyl ether (extra pure grade) was procured from Duksan. TiO 2
paste (SC-HT040) was procured from ShareChem. Lead iodide (PbI 2 , 99.999%) was purchased from TCI. Materials synthesis Formamidinium iodide (FAI) was synthesized as reported elsewhere 8 . In brief, 25 g formamidine acetate was directly mixed with 50 ml hydroiodic acid in a 500 ml round-bottomed flask with vigorous stirring. A light-yellow powder was obtained by evaporating the solvent at 80 °C for 1 h in a vacuum evaporator. The resulting powder was then dissolved in ethanol and precipitated using diethyl ether. This procedure was repeated three times until white powder was obtained, and the white powder was recrystallized from ethanol and diethyl ether in a refrigerator. After recrystallization, the resulting powders were collected and dried at 60 °C for 24 h. As reported previously 18 , black FAPbI 3
powder was synthesized by mixing the synthesized FAI (0.8 M) with PbI 2
(1:1 molar ratio) in 30 ml of 2-methoxyethanol with stirring. The yellow mixed solution was heated with a stirring bar at 120 °C and then recrystallized using the retrograde method. The resulting powder was filtered using a glass filter and baked at 150 °C for 30 min. Formamidine formate (FAHCOO) was synthesized by dissolving formamidine acetate in an excess of formic acid. The resulting solution was dried at 80 °C by rotary evaporation to remove most of the formic acid and acetic acid. A wet formamidine formate powder was obtained. This wet powder was recrystallized with a small amount of ethanol. A transparent, plate-like crystal was formed after the recrystallization, which was consecutively dried in vacuum for 10 h to obtain the final formamidine formate. Bulk perovskite samples for solid-state NMR are prepared by grinding the reactant (FAI and PbI 2
with FABr or FAHCOO as appropriate) in an electric ball (Retsch Ball Mill MM-200) for 30 min at 25 Hz, before annealing at 150 °C for 15 min. Substrate preparation Asahi FTO glass (1.8 mm, 7 Ω sq –1 ) was used as the substrate for the devices. The substrates were cleaned using the RCA-2 (H 2 O 2 -HCl-H 2 O) procedure for 15 min to remove metal-ion impurities. Then, the substrates were cleaned sequentially with acetone, ethanol and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) in an ultrasonic system for 15 min. To deposit the compact TiO 2
(c-TiO 2 ) layer, 60 ml of a titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate)/ethanol (1:10 volume ratio) solution was applied using the spray-pyrolysis method. Prior to the spraying process, the FTO substrates were placed on a hot plate and the temperature was increased to 450 °C rapidly. After the spray pyrolysis step, the substrates were stored at 450 °C for 1 h and then slowly cooled to room temperature. On top of the c-TiO 2
layer, a mesoporous TiO 2
(m-TiO 2 ) layer was deposited by spin-coating a TiO 2
paste dispersed in ethanol/terpineol (78:22 w/w). The TiO 2
nanoparticles have a diameter of approximately 50 nm and were purchased from ShareChem. The FTO/c-TiO 2
substrates prepared with m-TiO 2
were heated at 500 °C on a hot plate for 1 h to remove organic compounds first, and then slowly cooled to 200 °C. Device fabrication For the fabrication of the perovskite layer, the whole process was carried out at controlled room temperature (25 °C) and humidity (20% relative humidity). The reference perovskite precursor solution was prepared by mixing 1,139 mg FAPbI 3
and 35 mol% MACl in a mixture of DMF and DMSO (4:1). For the Fo-FAPbI 3
perovskite film, extra FAHCOO was added to the reference solution in the range of 1–4 mol%. For each sample, 70 μl of the solution was spread over the m-TiO 2
layer at 6,000 rpm for 50 s with 0.1 s ramping. During the spin-coating, 1 ml diethyl ether was dripped after spinning for 10 s. The perovskite film was then dried on a hot plate at 150 °C for 10 min immediately. See Supplementary Video  4
for details of the fabrication of perovskite films. After cooling the perovskite film on the bench, 15 mM of octylammonium iodide dissolved in IPA was spin-coated on top of the perovskite film at 3,000 rpm for 30 s. The hole-transport layer was deposited by spin-coating a Spiro-OMeTAD (Lumtech) solution at 4,000 rpm for 30 s. Details of the Spiro-OMeTAD solution was reported in the previous study 18 . Finally, a gold electrode was deposited on top of the Spiro-OMeTAD layer using a thermal evaporation system. The back and front contacts were formed with 100-nm-thick Au films deposited under a pressure of 10 −6
Torr. Characterization of the solar cells The solar cells without encapsulation were measured with a solar simulator (McScience, K3000 Lab solar cell
I-V
measurement system, Class AAA) in a room with relative humidity below 25% at 25 °C. An anti-reflecting coating layer was used for the devices. The light intensity was calibrated to AM 1.5G (100 mW cm −2 ) using a Si-reference cell certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory before performing measurements. No light soaking was applied before the potential
I – V
scans. All
J–V
curves were measured using a reverse scan (from 1.25 V to 0 V) and a forward scan (from 0 V to 1.25 V) under a constant scan speed of 100 mV s −1 . The stabilized power output was measured at the maximum power point using a xenon lamp light source. A non-reflective mask with an aperture area of 0.0804 cm 2
was used to cover the active area of the device to avoid the artefacts produced by the scattered light (the mask area is determined using a microscope). EQE measurements were obtained using a QEX7 system (PV Measurements). For the EQE EL
measurements, different bias voltages or currents were applied to the PSCs with a BioLogic SP300 potentiostat. The emitted photon flux from the PSCs was recorded using a calibrated, large-area (1 cm 2 ) Si photodiode (Hamamatsu S1227-1010BQ). All measurements were performed in the ambient environment (40% relative humidity, 24 °C). Characterization of the device stability For the stability tests, all PSCs were used without encapsulation. The shelf-life stability was assessed by measuring the photovoltaic performance of PSCs every tens of hours. The thermal stability test was performed by ageing the solar cells on a hot plate at 60 °C at 20% relative humidity. The performance of the devices was periodically measured after cooling the devices to room temperature. The operational stability was performed with a BioLogic potentiostat under an LED or a lamp that was adjusted to AM 1.5G (100 mW cm −2 ). The PSCs were masked and placed inside a homemade sample holder purged with continuous N 2
flow. The devices were aged with a maximum point power tracking routine under continuous illumination. The temperature-control system was not activated during the measurements.
J – V
curves with reverse voltage scans were recorded every 30 min during the whole operational test. Characterization of the perovskite film UV–vis absorption spectra of the perovskite films were recorded on a UV-1800 (Shimadzu) spectrophotometer. The SEM images of the perovskite films were taken with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, S-4800, Hitachi). XRD patterns of the perovskite films were performed using a D8 Advance (Bruker) diffractometer equipped with Cu K α
radiation ( λ  = 0.1542 nm) as the X-ray source. Steady-state photoluminescence and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements of the perovskite films were conducted using a PicoQuant FluoTime 300 (PicoQuant GmbH) equipped with a PDL 820 laser pulse driver. A pulsed laser diode ( λ  = 375 nm, pulse full-width at half-maximum <70 ps, repetition rate 200 kHz–40 MHz) was used to excite the perovskite sample. Surface roughness was assessed using a Cypher S atomic force microscope from Asylum Research under ambient conditions (24 °C, 50% relative humidity). An Olympus AC240-TS tip was used, and the system was operated under tapping mode. Two-dimensional grazing-incidence XRD of the perovskite films was performed at the BL14B1 beamline of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) using X-rays with a wavelength of 0.6887 Å. Two-dimensional grazing-incidence XRD patterns were acquired by a MarCCD mounted vertically at a distance of around 632 mm from the sample with grazing-incidence angles of 0.4° and an exposure time of 30 s. For the time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) measurements, the reference and 2% Fo-FAPbI 3
films were coated on a glass substrate using anti-solvent methods. The samples were analysed by TOF-SIMS using a hybrid IONTOF TOF-SIMS instrument. Depth profiling was accomplished with a three-lens 25-keV BiMn primary ion gun and a Bi 3 +
primary ion-beam cluster (1 pA pulsed beam current). Measurements used a caesium-ion beam for sputtering with an energy of 500 eV (sputtering current 1–23 nA). Profiling was completed with a 100 × 100 μm 2
primary-beam area and a 300 × 300 μm 2
sputter-beam raster. Non-interlaced mode was used to limit beam damage from the primary ion-beam (1 frame, 2 s sputter, 2 s pause). Solid-state NMR measurements Low-temperature (100 K)
1 H– 13 C cross-polarization and directly detected
13 C (125.8 MHz) NMR spectra, and room-temperature
207 Pb (104.7 MHz) NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III 11.7 T spectrometer equipped with a 3.2-mm low-temperature CPMAS probe.
207 Pb and
13 C spectra were referenced to Pb(NO 3 ) 2
at –3,492 ppm and the CH 2
resonance of solid adamantane at 38.48 ppm, respectively, at room temperature. Room temperature
207 Pb spectra were recorded with a Hahn echo and an effective recycle delay of 17 ms. The low-temperature
1 H– 13 C cross-polarization spectra of δ-FAPbI 3
and α-FAPbI 3
were recorded with 1 ms contact time, recycle delays of 1.5 s and 4 s, respectively, and 12 kHz MAS. The low-temperature
1 H– 13 C spectra of FAHCOO and Fo-FAPbI 3
were recorded with 2 ms contact time, 10 s recycle delay and 12 kHz MAS. The quantitative, directly detected
13 C experiment on a scraped 2% Fo-FAPbI 3
film was performed with a single pulse experiment, 12 kHz MAS and a 10 s recycle delay, which is more than 5 times the longitudinal relaxation time of
13 C (1 s). All
13 C spectra were acquired with 100 kHz
1 H decoupling. The low-temperature
1 H– 13 C cross-polarization spectrum of scraped 2% Fo-FAPbI 3
thin-film was measured with 2 ms contact time, 4 s recycle delay and 12 kHz MAS. NMR characterization was performed with 5% Fo-FAPbI 3 , because the greater amount of formate in the sample provides higher sensitivity compared to 2% Fo-FAPbI 3 . MACl was not included in the mechanosynthesized samples for NMR spectroscopy, because this would lead to broadening of the
13 C and
207 Pb resonances of FAPbI 3
(ref.
29 ), owing to different local environments with slightly different chemical shifts that arise from MA +
substitution of nearest-neighbour—and more distant—A-site cations. This broadening would obscure the small changes in the
207 Pb and
13 C resonances that arise from the incorporation of formate. However, given that the incorporation of MA +
ions has a minimal effect on the lattice structure, these findings also apply to the MA + -doped composition studied here.

Abstract Formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI 3 ) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are mainly fabricated by sequentially coating lead iodide and formamidinium iodide, or by coating a solution in which all components are dissolved in one solvent (one-pot process). The PSCs produced by both processes exhibited similar efficiencies; however, their long-term stabilities were notably different. We concluded that the major reason for this behaviour is the stabilization of the α-FAPbI 3
phase by isopropylammonium cations produced by the chemical reaction between isopropyl alcohol, used as solvent, and methylammonium chloride, added during the process. On this basis, we fabricated PSCs by adding isopropylammonium chloride to the perovskite precursor solution for the one-pot process and achieved a certified power conversion efficiency of 23.9%. Long-term operational current density–voltage measurements (one sweep every 84 min under 1-Sun irradiation in nitrogen atmosphere) showed that the as-fabricated device with an initial efficiency of approximately 20% recorded an efficiency of about 23% after 1,000 h that gradually degraded to about 22% after an additional 1,000 h.

Main Halide perovskite light absorbers of chemical formula APbI 3
(A represents a cation) exhibit typical three-dimensional (3D) structures. Formamidinium (FA, NH 2 CH=NH 2 + ), methylammonium (MA, CH 3 NH 3 + ) and caesium (Cs + ) are mainly used as A-site cations, and they strongly affect the performance and stability of a solar device 1 . Of these cations, FA shows the most promising performance because 3D formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI 3 ) perovskite has a lower bandgap ( E g ) and is thermally more stable than its MA counterpart 2 , 3 . However, 3D FAPbI 3
perovskite (α-phase) is metastable and undergoes phase conversion into a one-dimensional non-perovskite (δ-phase) at room temperature 4 . Several methods for stabilizing the α-phase of FAPbI 3
have been reported 5 . Generally, FAPbI 3
perovskite films obtained by solution processes are prepared by one-pot 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6
or sequential 7 , 8
spin-coating methods followed by an annealing process to improve crystallization. The one-pot method usually entails anti-solvent treatment to form a dense FAPbI 3
film. Amongst the solvents used in the dropping process, isopropyl alcohol (IPA) enhances the crystal quality of the FAPbI 3
layer in the one-pot process 9 . The sequential process exploits the reaction between organic cation solutions dissolved in IPA and those predeposited in the PbI 2
layer. In both the one-pot and sequential processes, additive engineering is an effective strategy for mediating perovskite crystal growth and passivating defect states. In particular, methylammonium chloride (MACl) additives have been used to improve the crystallinity and surface morphology of FAPbI 3
(ref.
5 ). However, the impact of the differences in FAPbI 3
perovskite crystallization on the efficiency and stability of the final perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has only been examined in a few cases 10 . Moreover, forming a high-quality stabilized α-phase FAPbI 3
perovskite film with large grain size, preferred crystal orientation and low trap density, which facilitates low non-radiative energy loss and long-term stability, is challenging. In this study, we explored the differences in the FAPbI 3
perovskite crystals prepared by the one-pot and sequential spin-coating methods by in situ synchrotron-based grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray diffraction (GI-WAXD), high-resolution transmittance electron microscopy (HR-TEM), time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS) and high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HR-XPS). Based on the analytical results, we propose the inclusion of isopropylammonium cations (iPAmH + ), mainly located at the grain boundaries of perovskite layers, formed by a secondary chemical side reaction, such as between MACl and IPA, in the sequential spin-coating process. In model experiments we fabricated PSC devices using a one-pot process in which 15 mol% isopropylammonium chloride (iPAmHCl) was added to the FAPbI 3
precursor solution. A substantial amount of the introduced iPAmHCl volatilizes during the annealing of the FAPbI 3
thin film at 150 °C, with iPAmHCl remaining at the FAPbI 3
grain boundaries contributing to the stabilization of the α-phase, enabling PSCs with high efficiency and stability to be fabricated. Comparison between the two processes using MACl and IPA The PSCs were prepared by two representative methods: the one-pot and sequential processes. As shown in Supplementary Fig.
1a , no important difference was noted between the two processes in terms of efficiency. Because other parameters such as the device structure and charge carriers were the same, the similar efficiency implies that the properties of the perovskite films are similar. However, the sequentially processed PSC device showed better stability than that fabricated by the one-pot process (Supplementary Fig.
1b ). As the perovskite thin films produced by both processes have almost the same thickness (Supplementary Fig.
2a ), surface morphology (Supplementary Fig.
2b ), light absorbance and bandgap (Supplementary Fig.
3a ), and Cl −
concentration (Supplementary Fig.
3b ), we can surmise that other factors stabilize the sequentially produced FAPbI 3
thin film. Regarding the chemical components, the only difference in the as-deposited layers formed by the two different processes is that IPA was used to dissolve the organic ammonia cations in the sequential process. To determine whether the inclusion of IPA affects the stability of the PSCs fabricated by the two processes, a comparison was made by adding IPA to a one-pot solution. We observed that the stability of the device fabricated by adding 20 mol% IPA to the one-pot solution notably increased compared with that fabricated without IPA, as shown in Supplementary Fig.
1c . To understand the two different processes and the effect of the addition of IPA to the one-pot solution, the formation of as-deposited layers coated by the one-pot and sequential processes was monitored by in situ synchrotron GI-WAXD during thermal annealing. The one-pot solution with the addition of IPA is denoted as ‘one-pot (IPA)’. Figures
1a–c
present the azimuthally integrated GI-WAXD patterns converted from the temperature- and time-dependent in situ GI-WAXD analyses. Representative two-dimensional (2D) GI-WAXD patterns are shown in Supplementary Fig.
4 . All three processes clearly showed a strong α-FAPbI 3
(100) cubic
diffraction peak, denoted as α(100) c , at
q  = 0.9893 Å −1
(sequential), 0.9959 Å −1
(one-pot) and 0.9888 Å −1
(one-pot (IPA)) in the initial pristine thin films. Note that MACl acts as an important additive for the formation of α(100) c
in the as-deposited layers 2 , 3 , which is evident from a comparison with a film prepared by the one-pot process without the MACl additive (Supplementary Fig.
5a ). All the pristine samples also showed many diffraction peaks in the A region, attributed to intermediate phases in the form of (solvent or additive) a (FA or MA) b Pb c I d
(refs.
11 , 12 ), with the one-pot (IPA) and one-pot processes showing the smallest and largest number of diffraction peaks, respectively. This suggests that the added IPA inhibits the formation of complex intermediate phases and contributes to the conversion to the crystalline FAPbI 3
phase. The one-pot and one-pot (IPA) processes showed extremely weak or clear δ-FAPbI 3
diffractions of δ4H(002) h , δ2H(100) h
and δ6H(101) h
(where the subscript h stands for hexagonal) at
q  = 0.811, 0.839 and 0.866 Å −1 , respectively (Fig.
1b,c
and Supplementary Fig.
5a,b ) 13 , whereas no δ2H(100) h
diffraction was observed in the sequential process (Fig.
1a ). To examine the differences in α(100) c
crystal formation after annealing at 150 °C, the mutually normalized integrated areas of α(100) c , δ4H(002) h , δ6H(101) h
and PbI 2
(001) trigonal , denoted as PbI 2 (001) t , for different annealing times were calculated (Fig.
1d–f ). The integrated areas of α(100) c
reveal that more than 60% of α(100) c
was obtained in the beginning for all three samples and reached nearly 100% within 15 min of annealing at 150 °C (Fig.
1d ). The ratio of the relative integrated areas of α(100) c
for one-pot/one-pot (IPA)/sequential is 1:1.2:1.5, which implies that the sequential process provides the most crystalline film. The integrated area of non-perovskite δ(100) h
shows the opposite tendency to that of α(100) c
(Fig.
1e ), with δ(100) h
of the sequential process disappearing after 3 min. The FAPbI 3
film prepared by the one-pot process did not fully convert from δ(100) h
to α(100) c
crystals, whereas the one-pot (IPA) achieved an almost complete transformation. The thermal stability of the FAPbI 3
films can be evaluated by observing the changes in the integrated area of PbI 2 (001) t
(Fig.
1f ). The integrated area of PbI 2 (100) t
of the one-pot (IPA) process showed a slower increase with annealing time at 150 °C than that of the one-pot process, indicating that the one-pot (IPA) process shows better thermal stability than the one-pot process. Moreover, the film prepared by the one-pot (IPA) showed a similar increase to that of the sequential process after annealing for 20 min, suggesting a similar thermal stability after a certain annealing time. The thermal stability can also be predicted by monitoring the variation in the relative amount of α(100) c
with annealing time with respect to the total amount of α(100) c , δ(100) h
and PbI 2 (001) t
(Supplementary Fig.
5c ). Initially, the sequentially processed film was highly stable, regardless of the annealing time; however, after annealing for approximately 25 min, the decrease in slope in the sequential and one-pot (IPA) samples was almost the same. In contrast, the film from the one-pot process tended to decrease sharply after annealing for 5 min. This is consistent with the higher stability of the PSCs fabricated by the sequential and one-pot (IPA) processes (Supplementary Fig.
1 ). Moreover, the development of crystal orientation over time was also observed to differ for each process (Supplementary Fig.
6 ). Fig. 1: Monitoring the formation of FAPbI 3

The red solid lines and red numbers represent lattice planes and the corresponding IS value, respectively. Full size image Although the presence of IPA influences the crystallization of FAPbI 3 , the volatile solvent IPA does not have a important effect on the α-phase stabilization of the FAPbI 3
perovskite film. Thus, the structures of the FAPbI 3
thin films prepared by sequential, one-pot and one-pot (IPA) processes at 150 °C were investigated using HR-TEM. Representative cross-sectional HR-TEM images are shown in Fig.
2a–c , and the magnifications of selected areas, shown by the yellow solid-line squares, are displayed in Fig.
2d–f . Two distinct crystal structures can be observed inside and outside the yellow dashed ellipses. The interplanar spacings (ISs) of selected crystals in Fig.
2d–f
were analysed and their
d
spacings and Miller indices (Supplementary Table

and Supplementary Fig.
7 ), together with their magnified HR-TEM images, are compared in Fig.
2g–i
and Supplementary Fig.
8 . For the FAPbI 3
film obtained by the sequential process, the crystals in the inner regions of the ellipses (IREs) in Fig.
2d , with an IS of 0.66 nm and a defined fast fourier transform (FFT) pattern, were identified as the typical hexagonal PbI 2
domain. The FAPbI 3
crystals in the outer regions of the ellipses (OREs) appear as a matrix structure in Fig.
2d,g
and Supplementary Fig.
8a ; the IS values of 0.36 and 0.31 nm are in good agreement with α(111) and α(200) domains, respectively. For the FAPbI 3
layers formed by the one-pot process, the IS values of 0.33–0.35 and 0.24 nm in the IREs shown in Fig.
2e,h
and Supplementary Fig.
8b
exhibit good agreement with α(111) and PbI 2 (003) domains, respectively. The OREs of the FAPbI 3
layers formed by the one-pot (IPA) process (Fig.
2f ) exhibit α-FAPbI 3
domains and amorphous phases. In the IREs in Fig.
2f,i
and Supplementary Fig.
8c , the IS of 0.69 nm and the FFT pattern are almost identical to those of the PbI 2
domain in the IREs of the sequentially processed FAPbI 3
layer. In the OREs of Fig.
2f,i
and Supplementary Fig.
8c , the crystal structure and FFT patterns were identified as the α(111) domain, and are highly similar to those of the sequentially processed FAPbI 3
crystal, as shown in Fig.
2g,i
and Supplementary Fig.
8c . Here, we recognize that introducing IPA substantially contributes towards the growth of 5–15-nm-sized cubic α-FAPbI 3
domains and the absence of amorphous domains, as compared with those in the one-pot FAPbI 3
layer. This implies that the final FAPbI 3
crystal properties are affected by the addition of IPA, similarly to the different crystallization behaviour observed during the annealing of the as-deposited layers. IPA was not completely removed by volatilization during the heat treatment step, suggesting that some is converted into other materials, which might affect the stabilization of the perovskite crystals. Transamination of IPA with MACl for iPAmHCl in perovskites The chemical species inside or outside the FAPbI 3
crystals deposited by the sequential, one-pot and one-pot (IPA) processes were investigated more closely using ToF-SIMS. This technology is one of the few that reveal chemical information on all components of halide perovskites 5 , 14 , 15 . Three representative elements, namely cationic lead (Pb + ) with positive polarity and anionic iodide (I − ) and carbon (C n − ,
n  = 1 and 2) with negative polarity, were selected for analysis because they are the basic components of the FAPbI 3
film. Supplementary Fig.
9a–d
shows the calculated integrated populations of each element obtained from scanning ToF-SIMS analysis (Supplementary Table
2 ). The calculated concentrations of Pb and I were similar for all three FAPbI 3
films. However, the total carbon (C −
and C 2 − ) concentrations in the sequential and one-pot (IPA) perovskite layers were higher (109.4 and 104.6%, respectively) than that observed in the one-pot film. This means that more organic materials were present in the FAPbI 3
thin films prepared by the processes including IPA. Nevertheless, it was difficult to specify the organic compounds based on this analysis. If any inclusions exist inside or outside the FAPbI 3
crystal, the chemical binding energy or the position of the valence band of FAPbI 3
can vary slightly. Figure
3
shows the synchrotron-assisted HR-XPS spectra for C 1 s
and N 1 s
for the three perovskite films prepared by the sequential, one-pot and one-pot (IPA) processes. The spectra obtained were deconvoluted using the Voigt function to identify the precise components 16 . First, we analysed the C 1 s
spectra in Fig.
3a–c , which indicate five components. Four of the components were well assigned to C–C(or CH) 17 , C–N 17 , FA 18
and C–I, in which I is bonded with C in MA or methane (marked as MA(complexes)) 17 . A mismatching chemical component is present in the region 286.5–287.0 eV in the C 1 s
spectra of each of the three perovskite films. Of the three unknown peaks, the two in the sequential and one-pot (IPA) spectra exhibit a highly similar energy at ~286.4 eV with a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 1.36 eV and 1.16 eV, respectively (the normalized fitting parameters are shown in Supplementary Table
3 ). In the one-pot spectrum, a peak at 286.9 eV and FWHM of 1.63 eV are indicated as the normalized values (Supplementray Table
3 ). We recognize that this component in the one-pot process is different from the other two components. Inamura et. al. 19
previously reported that the isopropylamine (iPAm) molecule attached to a Ni catalyst strain-free exhibits a peak at ~285 eV in the C 1 s
spectrum below 300 K. We presume that this chemical component can be assigned to the two components at 286.4 eV from the sequential and one-pot (IPA) processes. The difference between the FWHM in our observation (1.36 eV and 1.16 eV) and the previously reported value is less than 2.2 eV, and it can be influenced by the states of isolation as an ordered phase at grain boundaries in perovskite films and strain-free as disordered phase of iPAm molecules or iPAmH +
cations. The peak at 286.9 eV in the one-pot spectrum can be assigned to the C–N bond of the complexing methylamine molecule 17 . In the analysis of the N 1 s
spectra in Fig.
3g–i , the three perovskite films each indicate a major peak at ~401.0 eV, attributed to FA, and a minor peak at ~402.0 eV, assigned to MA. We note that sequential and one-pot (IPA) spectra have indicated one more component at ~400 eV with FWHM (full-width at half maximum) of ~2.0 eV (Fig.
3g ) than that of one-pot (Fig.
3i ). This peak corresponds to the amino group of iPAm 19 . Fig. 3: HR-XPS chemical analysis of the three FAPbI 3

films were 15 min for the one-pot and one-pot (IPA) processes and 30 min for the sequential process. The fitted parameters are summarized in Supplementary Table
3 . Full size image The potential presence of iPAmH +
or analogous compounds in the three perovskite films annealed at 150 °C after deposition by a sequential, one-pot and one-pot (IPA) process was also confirmed by Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance (FTNMR) spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig.
10 ). For the NMR measurements, a bottle containing MACl (40 mol%), PbI 2
(1.6 M) and IPA (20 mol%) in deuteriated
N , N -dimethylformamide ([D 7 ]DMF) was sealed and set in the temperature range of 75–85 °C for a reaction time of approximately 12 h. The
1 H FTNMR spectra of three precursor solutions, namely IPA–PbI 2 , iPAmHCl–PbI 2
and MACl–PbI 2 , dissolved in [D 7 ]DMF, were compared with those of MACl–IPA–PbI 2
before and after heating at 80 °C (Supplementary Fig.
11 ). Here, note that MACl did not dissolve well without PbI 2
in DMF. Interestingly, the
1 H NMR peak (5.75 ppm) due to the OH of IPA disappeared in the solution of MACl–IPA–PbI 2 , even before prolonged heating. This means that when MACl is added to IPA–PbI 2 , an unspecified intermediate phase forms with the iodoplumbate (multivalent PbI 2 ) dissolved in solution. In particular, the MACl–IPA–PbI 2
precursor solution after heating showed new but very small peaks (3.64 and 1.37 ppm) at the same positions as the NMR chemical shifts found in the spectrum of iPAmHCl. This transamination to iPAmH +
when MACl and IPA coexist in lead halide perovskite was further investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis. In the FTIR spectra of the PbI 2 , MACl–PbI 2 , IPA–MACl–PbI 2
and iPAmHCl–PbI 2
precursor solutions (Supplementary Fig.
12a ), we found a broad absorption peak at 1,020 cm −1
in only the MACl–IPA–PbI 2
and iPAmHCl–PbI 2
spectra. To assign this peak, we additionally conducted FTIR measurements on MACl (crystal), iPAmHCl (crystal) and IPA (liquid) as reference compounds (Supplementary Fig.
12b ). The peak at 1,020 cm −1
in the iPAmHCl (crystal) spectrum is the same as that in the spectra of the IPA–MACl–PbI 2
and iPAmHCl–PbI 2
precursor solutions. The peak at 1,000 cm −1
for MACl (crystal) also appears in the spectrum of the IPA–MACl–PbI 2
precursor solution. The broad absorption peak seen for the MACl–PbI 2
solution can also be considered to contain the 1,000 cm −1 peak. This implies that complete transamination did not occur in the MACl–IPA–PbI 2
precursor solution during heating. Nevertheless, the FTIR results provide strong evidence for the formation of iPAmHCl or its analogues in the precursor solution. Furthermore, in recent studies, the decomposition of organic hybrid perovskites under thermal stress, yielding ammonium (NH 4 + ) and dimethylammonium ((CH 3 ) 2 NH 2 + ) by deprotonation or methyl transfer from methylammonium (CH 3 NH 3 + ) 20 , and the alkylation of amines with alcohols 21 , 22
have been discussed. In these studies, the transamination of IPA 23 , 24 , 25
might have been possible through the partial secondary chemical reaction of a mixture comprising MACl, IPA, PbI 2
and partially ionized chemical species (for example, PbI 6 n − , Pb n +
(ref.
26 ), halide induced compounds (for nucleophilic amination) 27 ), with residual DMF and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) used as solvents during annealing of the perovskite film at 150 °C (low-temperature amination 22 , 28 ) under a remarkably high uniaxial strain of a few megapascals (the elastic constant of FAPbI 3
is in the gigapascal range) 29
from pre-annealing conditions (Fig.
1a–c ). Considering several peculiarities observed in halide perovskites, we propose that it may be possible to generate iPAmH +
molecules in the sequential and one-pot (IPA) processes. Although we cannot explain the precise chemical reaction pathway, we believe that the FAPbI 3
obtained by the IPA processes is likely to contain residual organic cations such as iPAmH +
in addition to FA. Performance of iPAmHCl-stabilized FAPbI 3
PSCs Based on these findings, we conducted model experiments to fabricate PSCs by adding 15 mol% iPAmHCl to the one-pot solution for the preparation of the FAPbI 3
layer. Further details are provided in the
Methods . As shown in Fig.
4a,b , the grain size in the FAPbI 3
film slightly increased when 15 mol% of iPAmHCl was added. Figure
4c,d
presents the 2D GI-WAXD patterns for the perovskite thin films deposited on mesoporous TiO 2
(mp-TiO 2 ) without and with iPAmHCl. Peaks attributed to the δ-FAPbI 3
phase, PbI 2
and other species can barely be observed (Supplementary Fig.
13a ), only those assigned to α-FAPbI 3 . In particular, the peaks of the 2D structures produced by iPAmH +
cations larger than those of FA were not visible at low angles. The peak at 13.92° is in full agreement with the (001) peak for single-crystal α-FAPbI 3
(ref.
30 ). In addition, as shown in Supplementary Fig.
13b , we found that the diffraction intensity increased as the number of iPAmH +
cations increased. This increase in intensity can be attributed to increased crystallinity or crystal orientation in a particular direction. Because the half-widths of the diffraction peaks were almost the same, the addition of iPAmHCl did not appear to increase the FAPbI 3
crystal size. Thus, the addition of iPAmHCl to FAPbI 3
with MACl led to the crystallization of pure α-FAPbI 3
and the preferred orientation of (100) c , which was also confirmed by GI-WAXD measurement (Fig.
4c,d
and Supplementary Fig.
14 ). This result is attributed to the contribution of the iPAmH +
cation to the van der Waals interaction responsible for crystal orientation, similarly to the cases in which organic cations with longer alkyl chains, such as butylammonium and octylammonium, were added 31 . Moreover, from a comparison of the 2D GI-WAXD patterns of the sequential, one-pot (IPA) and iPAmHCl-incorporated FAPbI 3
films (Figs.
1a,c
and
4d ), it is believed that iPAmH +
contributes importantly to reducing the formation of the δ-, 4H- and 6H-FAPbI 3
phases. For the system in which iPAmHCl has been added, iPAmHCl may partially disappears during the heat treatment process owing to the volatile Cl −
ions, as occurs on addition of MACl. However, based on the results of an NMR analysis (Supplementary Fig.
15 ), it is believed that a substantial amount of iPAmHCl still remains in the perovskite layer. The residual iPAmHCl in the perovskite layer is present mainly at the FAPbI 3
grain boundaries because no shift in the bandgap or diffraction angle of α-FAPbI 3
was observed after its addition. Furthermore, Cl −
ions were not detected on the surfaces of either perovskite film (Supplementary Fig.
16 ). By contrast, in the depth profile analysis of the perovskite layer by ToF-SIMS (Supplementary Fig.
17 ), we observed that the distribution of Cl −
ions is higher in the nanostructured TiO 2
electrode. This (as will be seen later) is one of the main reasons for the excellent stability observed under long-term light irradiation, including ultraviolet irradiation, even when TiO 2
is used as the photoelectrode 32 . Figure
4e
shows the photoluminescence (PL) measured for the FAPbI 3
thin film without and with iPAmHCl (15 mol%) incorporation, deposited on a glass substrate. The wavelength of the maximum PL peak did not change, although the intensity notably increased on addition of iPAmHCl. In addition, the iPAmHCl-incorporated perovskite contains a PL peak from pseudo-cubic iPAmHCl–FAPbI 3
(Supplementary Fig.
18 ). The maximum peak of the PL coincides with the bandgap determined from the Tauc plot (Fig.
4f ), obtained from ultraviolet/visible (UV/Vis) spectroscopic measurement. This confirms that the addition of the iPAmH +
cation has a negligible effect on the macroscopic bandgap (1.51 eV). Figure
4g
shows the time-resolved PL (TRPL) decay curves obtained by the time-correlated single-photon counting technique from the same thin films as used for the previous PL measurement. As shown in Fig.
4g
and Supplementary Fig.
19 , the radiative and non-radiative charge decay lifetimes were longer for the perovskite layer deposited after adding 15 mol% iPAmHCl, implying a low defect concentration in the α-FAPbI 3
crystals. Accordingly, we conclude that the added iPAmH +
cations contribute to the reduction in defect concentration through increased crystal orientation along the (100) plane with pure α-FAPbI 3
as a single crystal without the formation of 2D perovskite or substitution by FA, as shown in Fig.
4d . In particular, the addition of iPAmHCl appears to contribute to the stabilization of the α-phase of FAPbI 3 , allowing the fabrication of PSCs with favourable photocurrent density because the inherent bandgap of FAPbI 3
was not widened. Although α-FAPbI 3
can be stabilized by alloying 1 , 2 , 4
and the formation of 2D perovskite at grain boundaries 33 , 34 , we believe that iPAmHCl added to the precursor solution stabilizes the α-phase in a number of complex ways, including the surface passivation of FAPbI 3
crystals, as reported previously 9 , 33 , 34
and evidenced by our computational simulation (Fig.
5a ), and the induction of single crystal-like grains with few defects 30 . Fig. 4: Surface, crystal and optophysical properties. a , b , Field-emission scanning electron microscopy surface morphologies of the perovskite films deposited without ( a ) and with ( b ) iPAmHCl (15 mol%) on mp-TiO 2

cation located at the grain boundary of the α-FAPbI 3
supercell was simulated and found to considerably reduce the formation energy compared with the δ-FAPbI 3
crystal. The formation energies of five different concentrations were compared: the α- (red circle) and δ-phases (blue circle) of bulk FAPbI 3 , and the bulk α- (red circle), δ- (blue circle) and thin-film phases (green circle) of (iPAmH +  + FA)PbI 3 .

Source data Full size image The addition of 15 mol% iPAmHCl to the precursor solution resulted in a low defect concentration, thereby stabilizing the α-FAPbI 3
phase. Therefore, we fabricated a series of PSCs under the same specifications and investigated their performance. Figure
5b
shows the histograms of the 80 PSCs fabricated, and the average efficiency is higher than 21%. The current density–voltage ( J – V ) curves for a representative PSC, measured with and without anti-reflection polymer on the glass substrate, are shown in Supplementary Fig.

value from the

curve. One of the devices with the highest efficiencies among those fabricated under the same conditions was certified to have an efficiency of 23.9% in an accredited laboratory (Newport, USA), based on the quasi-steady-state method (Supplementary Figs.
21
and
22 ). The long-term operation of the PSC was investigated by employing the hallmark
J – V
measurement long-term stability test 35 . In this test,
J – V
curves were measured by scanning one cycle every 84 min under 1-Sun irradiation in nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature for 2,000 h, without a metal mask using a class A solar simulator. Figure
5c
shows the long-term behaviour of the normalized efficiency of the as-fabricated device. The efficiencies measured accurately with a metal mask and class 3A solar simulator before and after long-term operation are shown in Supplementary Fig.
23 . The efficiency gradually increased up to approximately 1,000 h, and then gradually decreased in the following 1,000 h. We surmise that the initial increase in efficiency of the device reflects the length of time required to optimize the surface and internal structure for charge transfer by the slow redistribution of iPAmH +
near the FAPbI 3
grain boundary (Supplementary Fig.
24 ). The decrease in efficiency after achieving the maximum efficiency can be attributed to the degradation of the perovskite surface and interface owing to the diffusion of the 4- tert -butylpyridine used as an additive in the organic hole conductor. Another factor is the corrosion of the gold layer used as a counter electrode as a result of iodide migration in FAPbI 3 , with the transformation of the FAPbI 3
α-phase to the δ-phase 36 . For reference (Supplementary Fig.
25 ), in a phenylethylammonium iodide-stabilized PSC 33 , the initial PCE of 22.02% rapidly decreased during the long-term
J – V
test to 60% of the initial value after approximately 125 h. Therefore, we believe that the relatively good long-term stability achieved following the addition of iPAmHCl is due to multiple factors, including the stabilization of the α-phase by the presence of iPAmH +
cations on the surface of FAPbI 3
and the interfacial stabilization of the perovskites by Cl −
ions on the surface of the TiO 2
electrodes. Conclusions A comparison of the FAPbI 3
perovskite films fabricated with MACl and IPA in the presence of iPAmHCl by one-pot and sequential solution processes suggested the possible incorporation of iPAmH +
cations into FAPbI 3 . Based on these findings, the effect of the addition of iPAmHCl to FAPbI 3
was systematically investigated. When 15 mol% iPAmHCl was added to FAPbI 3
in a PSC device, the certified efficiency was 23.9%. Moreover, the initial efficiency of the as-fabricated device was retained, even after 2,000 h of exposure to 1-Sun illumination. These enhanced PSC device characteristics can be attributed to the impact of iPAmHCl, which acts to stabilize the α-phase, reduce defects by surface passivation of FAPbI 3
and increase the preferred crystal orientation of single crystals. Methods Materials Unless otherwise stated, all materials were purchased from Sharechem, Sigma-Aldrich, Alfa Aesar, Junsei Organics and TCI, and were used as received. Fabrication of solar cells A dense blocking layer of TiO 2
(approximately 60 nm in thickness, bl-TiO 2 ) was deposited onto an F-doped SnO 2
(FTO, Pilkington glass, TEC-8, 2.2T) substrate by spray pyrolysis using titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) in ethanol (1:10, v/v) at 450 °C. A 150-nm-thick layer of nanostructured TiO 2
was spin-coated at 1,500 r.p.m. onto the bl-TiO 2 /FTO substrate using TiO 2
paste (Sharechem) diluted with 2-methoxyethanol and then annealed at 500 °C for 1 h in air to remove the organic components. In the sequential process, PbI 2
(1.30 M) was dissolved in a 1 ml mixture of DMF and DMSO (8:2, v/v) at 80 °C. The dripping solution was prepared by dissolving formamidinium iodide (FAI; 80 mg) in 1 ml IPA containing 10 mg MACl. The PbI 2
precursor solution was spin-coated on the mp-TiO 2
substrate at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s to obtain a transparent PbI 2 –DMSO intermediate film. Subsequently, 0.35 ml of the prepared dripping solution that included FAI and MACl was dripped on top of the PbI 2 –DMSO intermediate film and spin-coated at 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. The colour of the film changed to dark brown during spin-coating, and the film was then dried on a hot plate at 100 °C for 30 min and then at 150 °C for 30 min. The heat-treated film was washed with IPA and annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. For the one-pot and one-pot(IPA) processes, a 1.6 M precursor solution of FAPbI 3
and 40 mol% MACl in DMF and DMSO (6:1, v/v) was prepared, respectively. For the one-pot (IPA) process, IPA (20 mol%) was additionally added into the one-pot precursor solution. To modify the optimized coating-protocol for the formation of FAPbI 3
films incorporating iPAmHCl, 15 mol% iPAmHCl was added to the precursor solution containing 40 mol% MACl and 1.6 M FAPbI 3
(homemade). Then, the precursor solution was coated onto the nanostructured TiO 2 /bl-TiO 2 /FTO substrate at 1,000 r.p.m. for 30 s and 5,000 r.p.m. for 10 s with dripping with chlorobenzene or diethyl ether, respectively. The coated FAPbI 3
films were annealed on a hot plate at 150 °C for 10 min. We used an organic hole conductor prepared with a solution of 86 mg Spiro-MeOTAD (EM Index) in 1 ml chlorobenzene combined with 20 μl lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI)/acetonitrile (500 mg/1 ml), FK 209 Co(III) TFSI/acetonitrile (230 mg/1 ml) and 35 μl 4- tert -butylpyridine, which was spin-coated on the perovskite layer/mp-TiO 2 /bl-TiO 2 /FTO substrate at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. Finally, a gold counter electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation; the active area of this electrode was fixed at 0.16 cm 2 . Crystallographic investigation The GI-WAXD measurements were performed at the PLS-II 6D UNIST-PAL beamline of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL), Korea. The X-rays from the bending magnet were monochromatized to 18.986 keV ( λ  = 0.6530 Å) using a double-crystal monochromator that was focused both horizontally ( H ) and vertically ( V ) (90 ( V ) × 120 ( H ) μm 2
FWHM) on the sample position using a sagittal Si(111) crystal and toroidal mirror, respectively. The GI-WAXD sample chamber was equipped with a five-axis motorized stage for fine sample alignment, and the 2D GI-WAXD patterns were recorded with a 2D CCD detector (MX 225-HS, Rayonix). The diffraction angles were calibrated using NIST SRM660b, lanthanum hexaboride of approximately 6g (LaB 6 ) and the sample-to-detector distance was set at 246.4 mm. An incidence angle of 0.80° was used for the in situ GI-WAXD experiments to obtain crystallographic information on the overall thickness of the perovskite films and ensure that all incoming X-rays were directed onto the small length of the perovskite film sample without being blocked by the substrate or sample stage or just passing by. Various incidence angles in the range 0.117–0.8° were used for the static GI-WAXD experiments on the sequential, one-pot, one-pot (IPA) and one-pot (no MACl) samples before and after heat treatment, as well as on the FAPbI 3
film with or without iPAmHCl incorporation. For the static GI-WAXD experiments, an exposure time of 30 s was used at each incident angle. In situ GI-WAXD patterns were obtained every 5 s for the first 10 min, and then every 1 min between 10 and 30 min, with an X-ray exposure time of 3.5 s each. It took 2 min to raise the temperature of the FAPbI 3
film from room temperature to 150 °C, and then the temperature was maintained at 150 °C for 30 min using a fine-tuned temperature controller (Eurotherm 3504 Temperature Controller, Eurotherm). The X-ray diffraction patterns of the iPAmHCl-incorporated FAPbI 3
films were measured in the scattering angle range of 2 θ  = 5–40° using a SmartLab X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku) with a copper target operated at 45 kV and 200 mA (K α1
optics monochromator, symmetric Johansson Ge(111) curved optic crystal, vertical
θ / θ
geometry with a horizontal sample mounting geometry and high-speed 1D (D/teX Ultra 250) detector) at the UNIST Central Research Facilities. Observation of surface morphologies and crystal properties The scanning surface morphologies of the FAPbI 3
thin films were observed at ×80K and ×5K magnifications by cold field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; SU-8220, Hitachi) with a beam power of 5 kV. To investigate the local crystal properties, most samples were prepared using a focused ion beam (FIB; Helios NanoLab 450 model, FEI) and analysed by FE-SEM. The FIB milling/polishing process ensured that the samples had a smooth surface. Furthermore, the FIB-based milling process enabled the sample to be thinned to 100 nm, as required for HR-TEM characterization. HR-TEM images were collected using a JEM-2100F microscope (JEOL). ImageJ v.1.52a and Gatan Digital Micrograph v.3.9 and Gatan Microscopy Suite v.3.4.3 were used to analyse the HR-TEM images. Measurement of optical properties To measure the optical absorption and bandgaps, the prepared FAPbI 3
samples were scanned using a V-780 UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer (Jasco). The system comprised a Czerny–Tuner mount, a double monochromator, a fully symmetrical double beam (deuterium (spectral range 190–350 nm) and halogen lamps (spectral range 330–1600 nm)) and a photomultiplier tube with a Peltier-cooled InGaAs photodiode. The scan range was 190–1,600 nm with spectral bandwidths of 0.5 and 2.0 nm in the UV/Vis and near-infrared (NIR) regions, respectively; the photometric ranges were ~4–4 Abs for UV/VIS and ~3–3 Abs for NIR. The photometric accuracies were ±0.0015 Abs (0.0–0.5 Abs), ±0.0025 Abs (0.5–1.0 Abs) and ±0.3%T. The root-mean-square noise was 0.00003 Abs. FTIR investigation The FTIR spectra of the perovskite precursors and powders were recorded using a Frontier spectrometer (Series 6800, PerkinElmer) with best-resolution parameters and 20 accumulations in attenuated total reflection mode. The instrument specifications consisted of two temperature-stabilized deuteriated triglycine sulfate detectors (one optimized for mid-infrared (MIR) with an enhanced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 15,000:1 peak-to-peak for a 5-s scan, and one suited to NIR with <10 µA root-mean-square noise over a range of 250 nm for a 1 min scan), an optical system with a KBr beam splitter for MIR for the spectral range 8,300–350 cm −1
and a best resolution of 0.4 cm −1 , a CaF 2
beam splitter for the spectral range 14,700–2,000 cm – 1
and a best resolution of 0.5 cm −1 , a standard atmospheric vapour compensation/automatic performance verification/absolute virtual instrument, standard gold optics and standard KBr windows. FTNMR investigation For NMR analysis, the perovskite films were dissolved in [D 7 ]DMF. The FTNMR investigation was conducted using a VNMRS 600 spectrometer (magnet 14.09 T, 600 MHz). Charge carrier dynamics investigation Steady-state PL spectroscopy and time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) were performed using a FluoTime 300 spectrometer (PicoQuant) equipped with a PMA-C-192-M detector, a high-resolution excitation monochromator and a hybrid photomultiplier detector assembly (PMA Hybrid 40, PicoQuant). The FAPbI 3
samples were installed in an integrating sphere and excited at 512 nm. The excitation fluence intensities were set at 1.5 mW cm −2 , measured using a power meter (Thorlabs PM100D). The diode laser was controlled by a PDL 820 driver to control the picosecond pulses of the excitation light source (internal repetition rates between 196 and 80 MHz), and maintained at 10 MHz during TCSPC scanning. The laser beam was incident on the backside (FAPbI 3
side) of the FAPbI 3
film/glass substrate. TCSPC was performed at the wavelength of maximum PL intensity. The FAPbI 3
samples were coated on quartz glass substrates. ToF-SIMS measurement ToF-SIMS profiling, imaging and 3D tomography were performed to measure the lateral and depth distributions of the perovskite layers and completed devices. The samples were analysed using a ToF-SIMS V spectrometer (IONTOF) in high-current bounce mode (double crossover of beam alignment in the ion lens, 21 ns and 8 pA). The hybrid system consisted of a basic configuration consisting of a ToF-SIMS generation IV sputter gun and detector. The Bi +
primary beam was set at 25 keV and 1.2 pA. The sputter beam conditions were set at 1.0 KeV and 35 nA for Cs +
for elemental detection at negative polarity, and at 500 eV and 100 nA for O 2
for elemental detection at a non-interlaced positive polarity (1 frame, 2 s pause, 2 s sputter). The time of flight of pulse length was 10.9 ns, the repetition rate was 10 kHz, the acceleration voltage of the secondary ions was 2,000 V, the extraction timing was 0 s, the flight length was 2 m, the ion mirror voltage was 20 V, the acquisition time was 500 s, the incident angle was 45°, the sputter size was 200 μm × 200 μm, the analysis area was 50 μm × 50 μm and the primary ion dose density was 2.04522 e +
(ref.
14 ). Investigation of the energy levels and chemical analysis XPS measurements were conducted in an ultrahigh vacuum using a Scienta 2002 analyser at the PLS-II 10A2 beamline of PAL. To apply a bias potential, a tantalum sheet was put in direct contact with the FAPbI 3
film. The valence bands of the samples were measured at 130 eV. A photon energy of 700 eV was used for the core level measurement of N 1 s . iPAmH +
or iPAm incorporation was analysed by measurement of C 1 s
at 900 eV. The measurements were conducted in a vacuum chamber at 10 −9 –10 −10  torr, and three sweeping scans were collected. Evaluation of fabricated FAPbI 3
solar cells The
J – V
curves were obtained with a source meter (Keithley 2420) using a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Class AAA, 94043A) with 100 mA cm −2
illumination (AM 1.5G) and a calibrated silicon reference cell (Newport, Model 91150V) certified by National Renewable Energy Laboratory(NREL). The calibrated 1-Sun illumination was sustained automatically using an exposure control instrument (Newport, Model 68951). The
J – V
curves were measured in reverse scan mode. The step voltage and delay time were fixed at 10 mV and 40 ms, respectively. The delay time was set at each voltage step before measuring the current. The
J – V
curves of the devices were measured by masking the active area with a metal mask (active areas of 0.096 cm 2
(small cell)). The integrated current densities of PSCs were evaluated using external quantum efficiency system (IQE-200B, Newport, Oriel), which can monitor the range from 350 nm to 1100 nm in high resolution as 0.1 Hz (4–100 Hz chopper frequency), monochrometer band width as 1–30 nm FWHM, wavelength accuracy ±0.5 nm under 100 W xenon lamp. The steady-state current densities of the solar cell devices were measured under N 2
gas using an electrochemical station (Autolab PGSTAT302N, Metrohm Autolab). The dynamic
J – V
scanning long-term stability of the encapsulated PSC devices was investigated under N 2
gas, with one scan cycle every 84 min under 1-Sun irradiation. This test chamber was composed of stainless steel with a quartz glass window in front of the light source. The gas composition in the chamber was controlled using a vacuum pump and gas injection nozzles. The temperature in the loading stage was controlled by water flowing through the inlet pipeline from an external circulating water bath (RW3-0525, Lab Companion). The
J – V
curves were measured with a source meter (Keithley 2450) using a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Class A(ABB), IEC 60904-9 EDITION2) at 100 mA cm −2
illumination (AM 1.5G) and a calibrated silicon reference cell (Newport, Model 91150V) certified by NREL. The calibrated 1-Sun illumination condition was sustained automatically using an exposure control instrument (Newport, Model 68951). Density functional theory simulation Density functional theory calculations were performed to investigate the phase stability of the iPAmHCl-incorporated FAPbI 3 . We modelled supercell structures of the α-, δ- and thin-film phases accommodating 16 formula units. In each supercell of the α- and δ-phases, one iPAm molecule was substituted for one FA molecule at the A site, while two iPAm molecules were attached to the surfaces of the slab model, iPAmH + 2 FA 14 Pb 15 I 46 . To optimize the given supercell structures, we used a plane wave basis set with a cut-off energy of 600 eV within the projector augmented wave method 37
implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package 38 . To embody the correlation and exchange terms of the electron–electron interactions, we employed the generalized gradient approximation within the Perdew–Burke–Emzerhof formalism 39 . Van der Waals interactions were considered according to the Tkatchenko–Scheffler method 40 . The internal coordinates as well as the lattice parameters were relaxed until the minimum force became less than 0.03 eV Å −1 . For
k -point sampling, we used a regular grid of 3 × 4 × 3 for bulk supercells and 8 × 8 × 1 for the thin-film configuration. The rotational entropy of the FA molecule was evaluated on the basis of the moment of inertia reported previously 41 .

Devices for energy harvesting Solar cells
Abstract In perovskite solar cells, the interfaces between the perovskite and charge-transporting layers contain high concentrations of defects (about 100 times that within the perovskite layer), specifically, deep-level defects, which substantially reduce the power conversion efficiency of the devices 1 , 2 , 3 . Recent efforts to reduce these interfacial defects have focused mainly on surface passivation 4 , 5 , 6 . However, passivating the perovskite surface that interfaces with the electron-transporting layer is difficult, because the surface-treatment agents on the electron-transporting layer may dissolve while coating the perovskite thin film. Alternatively, interfacial defects may not be a concern if a coherent interface could be formed between the electron-transporting and perovskite layers. Here we report the formation of an interlayer between a SnO 2
electron-transporting layer and a halide perovskite light-absorbing layer, achieved by coupling Cl-bonded SnO 2
with a Cl-containing perovskite precursor. This interlayer has atomically coherent features, which enhance charge extraction and transport from the perovskite layer, and fewer interfacial defects. The existence of such a coherent interlayer allowed us to fabricate perovskite solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 25.8 per cent (certified 25.5 per cent)under standard illumination. Furthermore, unencapsulated devices maintained about 90 per cent of their initial efficiency even after continuous light exposure for 500 hours. Our findings provide guidelines for designing defect-minimizing interfaces between metal halide perovskites and electron-transporting layers.

Main Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) consist of α-formamidinium lead tri-iodide (FAPbI 3 ) perovskite sandwiched between charge-separation and charge-transporting layers. The high efficiency of PSCs is achieved by efficient charge extraction and transport without non-radiative recombination at the charge-selective interface with the uniform perovskite layer 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 . Recombination at interfaces may be reduced by minimizing the interfacial area between the perovskite and charge-transport layers. For smaller interfacial areas, planar electron-transporting layers (ETLs) and coated, very flat perovskite thin films are essential. A planar configuration is also required to achieve excellent charge extraction and transfer at the interface with low interfacial recombination loss 12 . PSCs with planar electrodes have primarily been studied using a SnO 2
ETL, because of the many advantages of SnO 2 , such as a high electron mobility and good energy-level alignment with perovskite and electrodes 13 . SnO 2
for planar PSCs has been deposited using various methods, including thermal oxidation of Sn( iv ) isopropoxide 14 , deposition of SnO 2
nanoparticles 13 , atomic layer deposition 15
and chemical bath deposition 10 , 16 . In addition to these methods of depositing SnO 2
electrodes, numerous studies have been conducted to reduce the interfacial recombination losses through surface passivation and to control the energy level and increase charge transport by doping 12 . Interfacial passivation may further reduce non-radiative recombination between the perovskite and charge-transporting layers 17 . Passivation of the perovskite surface with long organic salts has been shown to substantially reduce interfacial defects between the hole-transporting layer (HTL) and FAPbI 3
perovskite 4 , 18 . SnO x –Cl colloids derived from Sn( iv )Cl 4
solution have been reported 19
to form methylammonium tin iodide (MA 2 SnI 6 ) and SnO 2 , with spontaneous exchange reactions between Cl −
and I −
ions when methylammonium iodide (MAI) co-existed. It has also been reported that a perovskite precursor containing Cl −
ions resulted in a large number of Cl −
ions being retained at the interface between the perovskite and ETL electrode 20 , 21 . We thus note that when the halogen-bonded SnO 2
and the perovskite precursor come into contact they form a chemically interconnected interface. Here we report the formation of a coherent interlayer between a perovskite thin film and a Cl-bonded SnO 2
(Cl-bSO) electrode coated with a Cl-containing FAPbI 3
perovskite precursor (Cl-cPP) solution. We explore the presence of this interlayer by using the surface-sensitive grazing-incident X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), synchrotron-based grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray diffraction (GI-WAXD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). From these analytical characterizations, we infer the formation of a crystalline FASnCl x
phase as an atomically coherent interlayer between the perovskite and SnO 2 . This interlayer between the perovskite and ETL reduces the interfacial charge recombination loss and contact resistance, enabling the fabrication of a PSC with a power conversion efficiency of 25.8%. Interlayer formation Figure

depicts multilayered thin films of ETL (n), perovskite (i) and HTL (p), along with an interlayer formed by the reaction between the Cl-cPP solution and a Cl-bSO ETL. Energy levels based on experimental 22 , 23
and theoretical (Supplementary Fig.
1 ) values for each component in the n–i–p architecture are also shown. We expected the interlayer to play a part in substantially reducing the back-recombination of extracted carriers that remain in the interfacial region, without greatly disturbing the carrier transport of photogenerated electrons.

d , Simulation of the formation of the interlayer between perovskite and SnO 2 . Full size image One of the main roles of the ETL on the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) is to effectively block the holes generated by light absorption of the perovskite while transferring electrons quickly across the interface between the ETL and perovskite. This means that the ETL must be densely coated to prevent direct contact between the FTO substrate and the perovskite, while maintaining a sufficiently small thickness to prevent direct contact between the ETL and perovskite. Therefore, we deposited a Cl-bSO ETL on FTO, using either spin-coating 24 , 25
or chemical bath deposition 10 , 16
after dissolving either SnCl 2 ⋅ 2H 2 O in ethanol or SnCl 4
in deionized water. In Supplementary Fig.
2 , we provide a cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a representative device using SnO 2
as the ETL, and ultraviolet–visible absorption spectra and X-ray diffraction patterns of perovskites coated on various ETLs. We investigated the inclusion of Cl −
ions in the SnO 2
layer using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). As shown in Fig.
1b , the SnO 2
layer coated on the FTO substrate using SnCl 2 ⋅ 2H 2 O contained a considerable number of residual Cl −
ions, consistent with previously reported results 23 . In comparison, the TiO 2
thin film, obtained via a similar process using a TiCl 4
aqueous solution, contained a relatively small number of Cl −
ions. In the case of SnO 2 , all layers contained a large number of Cl −
ions when coated with chlorides as the starting materials (Extended Data Fig.
1 ). The large number of Cl −
ions found in SnO 2
may be associated with two common oxidation states of Sn (Sn 2+
and Sn 4+ ). Because the Sn 2+
oxidation state is common in SnO 2 , Cl −
ions may easily enter the O vacancy sites, and the O sites may also be substituted in some cases 26 . However, in the case of TiO 2 , only Ti 4+
can be stably present, even if it is prepared under conditions in which a large number of Cl −
ions are present; Cl −
ions may be contained only at the impurity level. Here, Cl-cPP was prepared by dissolving FAPbI 3
with 35 mol% methylammonium chloride (MACl) as a source of Cl −
ions and 3.8 mol% methylenediammonium dichloride as an α-FAPbI 3
phase stabilizer. When MACl is added as a source of Cl −
ions, it eventually volatilizes and almost disappears from the perovskite, leading to crystallization, grain formation and preferred orientation of the perovskite 27 . The perovskite layer on the Cl-bSO electrode was obtained by spin-coating a Cl-cPP solution and then annealing at 120 °C for 1 h. We analysed the residual Cl −
ions for the perovskite on SnO 2
ETL via depth profiling using ToF-SIMS (Fig.
1c ). We observed a relatively large number of Cl −
ions, distributed mainly with a certain thickness near the SnO 2
electrode; the number of Cl −
ions that remained in the perovskite was very small. These results suggest the formation of a FASnCl x
layer at the interface between the perovskite and the SnO 2 . However, even when a SnO 2
electrode that does not bind with Cl −
ions was used, a large number of Cl −
ions were detected near the electrode, with a sharper distribution (more distinct in Cl 2 − ) near the interface than for Cl-bSO (Extended Data Fig.
2 ). Before experimentally investigating the formation of a new phase between the perovskite and SnO 2
electrodes, we theoretically examined whether the FASnCl x
layer at the interface between the SnO 2
ETL and halide perovskite could be formed by an interfacial reaction between Cl-bSO and the Cl-cPP solution. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate the possibility of generating a very stable FASnCl 3
interlayer between FAPbI 3
perovskite and SnO 2
without notable lattice distortion (Fig.
1d , Extended Data Fig.
3 ). However, when TiO 2
was used as an electrode, a stable interface could not be formed, owing to a large difference in electronegativity between Ti and Sn, even when Cl-binding TiO 2
was used (Extended Data Fig.
4 ). This is related to the easy formation of Sn-based perovskites in the presence of halides and organic cations, such as FA with Sn 2+
(refs.
28 , 29 ). Characterization by grazing-incident XAFS To find out whether Cl-bSO is a key factor in the formation of the FASnCl x
interlayer, we used surface-sensitive grazing-incident XAFS to investigate the vicinity of the interface between SnO 2
and FAPbI 3
perovskite. In the Sn K-edge XAFS analysis, we used a 100-μm-wide vertical beam and a grazing incidence of 0.5° to observe the local geometric environments around Sn atoms at the interface between the ETL and FAPbI 3
perovskite. Figure
2a
shows the Fourier-transformed spectra for the pristine Cl-bSO and the Cl-bSO coated with either Cl-cPP or a perovskite precursor without Cl −
ions and then annealed at 120 °C for 1 h. The highest peak is indicative of the first nearest-neighbour shell, which corresponds to the O atoms surrounding the central Sn atom. We assign the second-highest peak, which appears at approximately 2.2 Å, to the Sn–Cl chemical bond. This indicates that SnO 2
deposited in the presence of a large number of Cl −
ions contained a large number of Cl −
ions bound directly to Sn cations. In addition, the peak height corresponding to the Sn–Cl bond substantially increased when the Cl-cPP solution was coated on Cl-bSO and then annealed at 120 °C. The increase in the number of Cl −
ions relative to Cl-bSO may be due to the formation of a FASnCl x
layer in which FA +
and Cl −
ions in the Cl-cPP solution combine with Sn–Cl of SnO 2 , increasing the number of Cl −
ions bound to Sn. In Cl-bSO coated with a Cl − -ion-free perovskite precursor solution and annealed at 120 °C, the Sn–Cl peak shifted to higher
r -space by 0.3 Å, which corresponds to the partial formation of the Sn–I bond. Here
r
and
k
are the phase-shift-uncorrected interatomic distance from Sn atoms and the photoelectron wavenumber, respectively. This is consistent with a report 19
that the spontaneous exchange with I −
ions of MAI occurred when Cl −
ions in Cl-bSO prepared by hydrolysis of SnCl 4
came into contact with MAI. Fig. 2: Local geometric environments around the Sn atoms in the SnO 2

o C for 1 h. In all WT-XAFS, the  η / σ
value of 10/1 is constantly applied in the wavelet transformation, where
η
and
σ  are the frequency of the oscillation functions and the half-width, respectively. Full size image As a comparison, Fig.
2b
shows the Fourier-transformed features of Sn K-edge XAFS before and after applying the Cl-cPP solution to pure SnO 2
thin layers derived from isopropanol-dissolved Sn( iv ) isopropoxide and commercial SnO 2
colloids on a glass substrate. In both cases, no meaningful peaks for the Sn–Cl chemical bond are visible before or after the Cl-cPP solution was applied to the SnO 2 , as in the above. This implies that the Cl −
ions applied on the pure SnO 2
did not cause the formation of Sn–Cl bonds. To better visualize the atomic distributions of the Cl atoms at the interface, we used wavelet-transform XAFS (WT-XAFS) of the correlation between the peaks with
k -space data (Fig.
2c–e ). The spectral comparison of WT-XAFS for Cl-bSO and pure SnO 2
ETL layers clearly shows the local structural change in space at this interface. The highest-intensity lobes in the centre ( k  = 6 Å −1 ,
r  = 1.6 Å), which are all visible in the WT-XAFS, correspond to the O atoms towards the core ETL layers. At higher radial distances, the lobe ( k  = 9.6 Å −1 ,
r  = 2.25 Å) is attributed to the Cl atom in the ETL surface region (Fig.
2c ). When a Cl-cPP solution was applied on Cl-bSO, the lobe caused by the Cl atom appears wide and strong after annealing at 120 °C. By contrast, the WT-XAFS results for the two pure SnO 2
layers are constant irrespective of annealing under a Cl-cPP solution (Fig.
2d, e ). Also, the WT-XAFS results for the application of the Cl − -ion-free perovskite precursor clearly show that Sn–I ( k  = 10.5 Å −1 ,
r  = 2.55 Å) was generated by Cl − –I −
exchange (Extended Data Fig.
5 ). Confirmation of the coherent interlayer To further confirm the formation of the FASnCl x
layer at the interface between SnO 2
and the FAPbI 3
perovskite in contact with Cl-bSO and the Cl-cPP solution, we performed a synchrotron-based GI-WAXD experiment. Figure
3a, b
shows two-dimensional GI-WAXD patterns at a grazing incidence of 0.12° for the same glass/SnO 2 /FAPbI 3
as the XAFS measurements, using perovskite coated on SnO 2
layers with and without Cl −
ions on a glass substrate. The background of the glass substrate was subtracted to make the diffracted image clearer. Fig. 3: Two-dimensional GI-WAXD patterns, HR-TEM and photoluminescence after applying Cl-cPP on Cl-bSO and SnO 2 . a ,

( a ) and Cl-bSO ( b ). In

q z
and
q xy
directions.
c , HR-TEM for the multilayers obtained from Cl-cPP on Cl-bSO. The interplanar spacing and fast Fourier transform patterns for the white circled regions are shown in the insets. The black rectangle was viewed by indicating the size (2 nm × 8 nm) of the interlayer observed in GI-WAXD.
d , Steady-state photoluminescence of perovskites deposited on various electrodes. Full size image In the two-dimensional GI-WAXD patterns, the perovskite shows very good crystallinity and strong texturing. The crystallinity and texturing of a full-cell perovskite layer more than ten times thicker than the current perovskite layer were reduced substantially (Supplementary Fig.
3 ). Such excellent crystallinity and texturing are believed to correspond to approximately monocrystalline properties in the heterogeneous nucleation and initial growth of perovskite on SnO 2 . Most of the diffraction patterns are in good agreement with results simulated using the diffraction pattern calculator toolkit 30
with a cubic α-FAPbI 3
structure 31
and hexagonal PbI 2
structures 32
(Extended Data Fig.
6 ). When comparing the GI-WAXD patterns of perovskites coated on isopropoxide-derived SnO 2
(Fig.
3a ) and Cl-bSO (Fig.
3b ), new diffraction spots elongated in the vertical direction (red dotted rectangles) are clearly observed at the Cl-bSO electrode. The out-of-plane (along the
q z
direction, where
q z
is the out-of-plane scattering vector) and in-plane (along the
q xy
direction, where
q xy
is the in-plane scattering vector) one-dimensional GI-WAXD profiles (Extended Data Fig.
7 ) do not match any types of FAPbI 3
or SnO 2 . Considering
q z -cut (out-of-plane) and
q xy -cut (in-plane) profiles of the elongated diffraction spots,
d
spacings ( λ  = 2 d sin θ ), where
λ
is wavelength,
d
is the crystal lattice planar spacing and
θ
is the angle of incidence, of 3.94 Å and 1.97 Å in the
q xy
profile and of 5.29 Å and 2.64 Å in the
q z
profile were obtained for the first and second peaks, respectively. The fact that the
d
spacing of the second peak is almost twice that of the first peak indicates that both peaks belong to the same family of diffraction planes. These diffraction spots support the idea that the newly formed structure is composed of highly textured crystallites of approximately 2 nm and 8 nm size in the out-of-plane and in-plane directions, respectively, with crystallite size estimated from the diffraction-peak widths using the Scherrer equation. These results suggest the formation of FASnCl 3
or its analogues between the perovskite and the SnO 2
electrode. For a more quantitative analysis, we compared the diffraction patterns with previously reported cubic FASnCl 3
( a  = 5.69 Å, where
a
is the lattice constant in the
a  axis) 22 . However, the results of GI-WAXD are inconsistent with the cubic structure. On the basis of the GI-WAXD analysis, we infer that the interlayer has a tetragonal structure with
a  =  b  = 5.56 Å and
c  = 5.29 Å ( b
and
c  are the lattice constants in the
b  and
c  axes), and that the characteristic diffraction peaks observed in the structure belong to the (11 l ) and (22 l ) families; (111), (112), (221) and (222) diffraction peaks are clearly observed in Extended Data Fig.
8 . Given that the interlayer is a thin film that connects the two heterostructures between the perovskite and SnO 2 , it may be more reasonable for the lattice to have a tetragonal structure with a lower symmetry than that of a cubic structure. Nevertheless, we label the interlayer as FASnCl x
rather than FASnCl 3 , because it is not fully defined. Figure
3c
shows a HR-TEM image of the vicinity of the interface, which was formed by coupling Cl-bSO and a Cl-cPP solution. The interface between SnO 2
and FAPbI 3
contacted very well, and the boundaries could not be distinguished from each other. We expected this interface to effectively extract the charge generated from the perovskite. To obtain additional information on the crystal properties of each region, we determined the interplanar spacing and fast Fourier transform patterns. The interplanar spacings of about 0.33 nm and 0.37 nm in the region of SnO 2
and FAPbI 3
correspond well with SnO 2 (110) 33
and α-FAPbI 3 (111) 34
domains, respectively. The interplanar spacing in the interfacial region is smaller than that of α-FAPbI 3 , indicating the presence of a new interlayer. Figure
3d
shows a comparison of the photoluminescence spectra measured by excitation with a 520-nm laser for a thin film annealed at 120 °C after coating a Cl-cPP solution on SnO 2
or TiO 2
electrodes formed using various methods on FTO substrates. The combination of Cl-bSO and Cl-cPP solution exhibited substantially lower photoluminescence intensity than did the planar SnO 2
and planar TiO 2
electrodes, alongside mesoporous TiO 2  (mp-TiO 2 ). Comparing the photoluminescence of the perovskite layer with and without the SnO 2
or TiO 2
electrode on the glass substrate, we found that the photoluminescence of the perovskite coated on the SnO 2
or TiO 2
layer was substantially lower (Extended Data Fig.
9 ). This reduction in photoluminescence suggests an increase in interfacial non-radiative recombination and/or a decrease in radiative recombination through non-radiative recombination channels (charge transfer to ETLs) of photo-generated electron holes. Interfacial non-radiative recombination of the perovskite layers deposited on SiO 2
(glass), TiO 2
or SnO 2
oxides using the same process does not make much difference because these materials form similar interfacial contacts. Cl-bSO, which forms a unique interlayer with the perovskite even with the same SnO 2
(Supplementary Fig.
2c ), further reduces the photoluminescence. We investigated the origin of the reduced photoluminescence through charge recombination by using time-resolved photoluminescence (Extended Data Fig.
10 ) to monitor the charge-carrier dynamics of perovskite 35 , with the same specimens used for photoluminescence measurements. We analysed the fast ( τ 1 ) and slow ( τ 2 ) decay components of the bi-exponential decay function
y  =  a 1 exp(− t / τ 1 ) +  a 2 exp(− t / τ 2 ), where
a n
is the amplitude components and  t
is the time constant; parameters are listed in Supplementary Table
1 . The fast decay component results from trap-assisted charge recombination of the perovskite and free-carrier transport to the electrode. The slow decay component results from radiative charge recombination 36 , 37 . The fast decay lifetime is the shortest for Cl-bSO, for which the photoluminescence is the most reduced; the weight fraction of that lifetime is also more pronounced. This implies that the combination of Cl-bSO and Cl-cPP solution not only reduces non-radiative interfacial recombination but also allows photogenerated charges to move to the electrode more rapidly. In general, SnO 2
enables faster charge extraction from perovskites owing to a lower conduction band than that of TiO 2 14 , 24 , 25 . Nevertheless, it is interesting that a planar TiO 2
electrode containing a small amount of Cl, prepared with an aqueous TiCl 4
solution, exhibited lower photoluminescence intensity than did a planar SnO 2
electrode. Because the difference in the charge extraction of the ETL is related directly to the characteristics of the PSC, we compared the efficiency of all performance parameters (Supplementary Fig.
4 ) and the photostability between the electrodes. Photovoltaic performance As shown in Fig.
4a , the efficiencies, on average, coincided with the intensity trend of the photoluminescence, giving the lowest efficiency for the SnO 2
(isopropoxide) ETL with the highest intensity, and the highest efficiency for the lowest intensity of Cl-bSO. The efficiencies of Cl-bSO and the TiO 2
ETL obtained from chloride compounds did not vary substantially; however, the number of bound Cl −
ions was different, and high compared to Cl − -ion-free SnO 2
ETLs. Nevertheless, Fig.
4b
shows that the stability under the maximum power tracking condition was substantially different. The efficiency of PSCs based on a planar TiO 2
ETL decreased substantially over time, even within an hour, in contrast to those based on Cl-bSO. This indicates that the interfacial binding between the perovskite and electrode in the planar structure had a substantial influence on the stability, rather than being a unique property of TiO 2 , because the mp-TiO 2
electrode exhibited excellent light stability. Fig. 4: Performance of PSCs based on various electrodes. a , Power conversion efficiency statistics (centre line, median; small square, mean; box, 25%–75% standard deviation; whiskers, outliers) of PSCs fabricated with SnO 2 , Cl-bSO and TiO 2 . In the statistics, 11 devices were used for SnO 2
(isopropoxide), 14 devices for SnO 2
(colloids), 51 devices for Cl-bSO and 16 devices for Cl-TiO 2 .
b , Power conversion efficiencies monitored by maximum power point tracking for PSCs fabricated with various electrodes, under air-mass 1.5 global, including ultraviolet.
c ,
J−V
curves of the best-performing device, measured in reverse (red solid line) and forward (blue dashed line) modes.
d , Maximum power point tracking measured for the PSC fabricated using Cl-bSO and Cl-cPP according to the ISOS-L-1I protocol 38
(1 Sun illumination without ultraviolet filter; xenon lamp, 450 W, 100 mW cm −2 , air-mass 1.5, ambient and inert atmosphere). Full size image The difference in interfacial bonding is evident from the measurement of the thermally stimulated and dark currents for the PSCs fabricated with planar Cl-bSO and TiO 2
ETL (Supplementary Fig.
5 ). The PSC based on planar Cl-bSO had a very low defect concentration compared to that of the TiO 2
ETL. Because the difference between the PSC prepared with planar Cl-bSO and a TiO 2
ETL is due to only the interface, we conclude that Cl-bSO formed a coherent interface with the perovskite, with fewer defects compared to TiO 2
ETL. The importance of this interfacial bonding is supported by the fact that PSCs fabricated using SnO 2
as electrodes, which does not bind Cl −
ions, photodegraded faster than PSCs fabricated with a Cl-bSO ETL. Even if an interface with excellent charge extraction and transfer without defects was formed, an electrode with a pinhole-free, uniform and appropriate thickness was required to produce a high-efficiency PSC. Therefore, PSCs were fabricated with Cl-bSO electrodes, obtained by spin-coating either a SnCl 2 ⋅ 2H 2 O solution dissolved in ethanol 24
or a SnCl 4
solution dissolved in deionized water 19
on a SnO 2
primary layer coated using Cl − -ion-free Sn-isopropoxide. In addition, Cl-bSO deposited using chemical bath deposition 16
was used to fabricate PSCs. Although similar Cl-bSOs were used as the electrodes, the average efficiency of the PSCs varied slightly depending on the coating method (Supplementary Fig.
6 ). A relatively high efficiency was obtained from the Cl-bSO electrode coated with an SnCl 4 -derived SnO 2
colloid and the Cl-bSO electrode formed by chemical bath deposition in an SnCl 2 ⋅ 2H 2 O aqueous solution. Figure
4c
shows the current density–voltage ( J – V ) characteristics of the reverse and forward bias sweeps with an antireflective film attached to the device surface for one of the best-performing PSCs. The power conversion efficiency obtained from the
J – V
curve in reverse and forward scan modes was 25.83% and 25.65%, respectively, revealing negligible hysteresis between the two modes; parameters are summarized in Extended Data Table
1 . The external quantum efficiency for the one of the best-performing devices is provided in Supplementary Fig.
7 . The certified (by an accredited laboratory in Newport, USA) stabilized power conversion efficiency is 25.5%, with short-circuit current density ( J sc ) = 25.74 mA cm −2 , open-circuit voltage ( V oc ) = 1.1885 V and fill factor (FF) = 83.2%, measured using the quasi-steady-state method (Supplementary Fig.
8 ). We tested the long-term operational stability of the unencapsulated device under an ambient and inert atmosphere (N 2 ), with maximum power point tracking under 1 Sun illumination and without an ultraviolet cut-off filter, in accordance with the ISOS-L-1I protocol 38
(Fig.
4d ). The device maintained roughly 90% of its initial efficiency after 500 h, which is comparable to other highly efficient PSCs with power conversion efficiencies of more than 23% 10 , 36 . In summary, we observed that, when a perovskite thin film was prepared by coating Cl-cPP on a Cl-bSO electrode, an FASnCl x
interlayer with a crystalline thickness of approximately 2 nm formed between the perovskite and the electrode. Although we could not identify the exact crystal structure, we believe it functions as a coherent interlayer with rapid charge extraction and minimal charge recombination at the interface between the SnO 2
electrode and the perovskite thin film. This coherent interlayer made it possible to manufacture PSCs with a power conversion efficiency of 25.8% (25.5% certified), with high stability under maximum power point tracking for 500 h. This result may inform the development of new strategies for the fabrication and design of photoelectrodes for PSCs with high efficiency and stability. Methods Materials The materials used in the experiments included: lead( ii ) iodide (PbI 2 ; 99.99%, TCI), 4-methoxy-phenethylammonium iodide (MeO-PEAI; 99%, Greatcell Solar), tin( ii ) chloride dihydrate (SnCl 2 ·2H 2 O; 98%, Acros), tin( iv ) chloride (TiCl 4 ; 99%, Sigma-Aldrich), tin( iv ) chloride (SnCl 4 ; 98%, Sigma-Aldrich), potassium iodide (KI; 99.999%, Sigma-Aldrich), deionized water (H 2 O; Alfa Aesar), hydrochloric acid (HCl; 37 wt% in H 2 O, Sigma-Aldrich), thioglycolic acid (C 2 H 4 O 2 S; 99%, Sigma-Aldrich), methylenediamine dihydrochloride (MDACl 2 ; 98%, Sigma-Aldrich), methylammonium chloride (Merck), formamidinium iodide (FAI; 99.99%, Greatcell solar)
N , N -dimethylformamide (DMF; 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; 99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), 2-propanol (99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich), chlorobenzene (99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich), 2-methoxyethanol (2-ME; 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich), hydriodic acid (HI; 57 wt% in H 2 O, Sigma-Aldrich), Spiro-OMeTAD (Lumtec.), 4- tert -butylpyridine ( t -BP; Sigma-Aldrich), bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (Li-TFSI; 99.95%, Sigma-Aldrich), FK209 Co( iii ) TFSI salt (Lumtec.), acetonitrile (ACN; 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich), ethanol (99.9%, SAMCHUN) and ethyl ether (99.0%, SAMCHUN). Formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI 3 ) black power was synthesized by mixing the synthesized 19.5 mol of FAI with PbI 2
(1:1 molar ratio) in 11 ml of 2-ME in a 70-ml vial by stirring. The mixed solution was heated to 120 °C in an oil bath and then precipitated using the retrograde method. The filtered FAPbI 3
powder was baked at 150 °C for 30 min. Deposition of the electron-transporting layers SnO 2
Tin( iv ) isopropoxide (99%, 10% w/v in isopropanol, Alfa Aesar) was further diluted (that is, 1:10 v/v in isopropanol) and spin-coated at 5,000 rpm for 30 s. The films were heat-treated at 210 °C for 15 min. Tin( iv ) oxide (15% in H 2 O colloidal dispersion, Alfa Aesar) was further diluted (that is, 1:5 w/w in H 2 O) and spin-coated at 3,000 rpm for 30 s. The films were annealed at 150 °C for 1 h. Cl-binding SnO 2
66 mM of SnCl 2 ·2H 2 O (>98%, Acros) in ethanol was spin-coated onto the substrates at 3,000 rpm for 30 s. The films were heat-treated at 100 °C for 10 min and annealed again at 190 °C for 1 h. 10 mM of SnCl 2 ·2H 2 O with 500 mg of urea was dissolved in 10 μl of thioglycolic acid, 500 μl of HCl and 40 ml of deionized water. FTO glass (Asahi FTO glass, 12–13 Ω cm −2 ) substrate was dipped in the solution for 6 h. The substrates for depositing SnO 2
were annealed for 1 h at 150 °C. The SnO 2
colloidal solution was prepared by annealing an aqueous SnCl 4
solution at 70 °C for 30 min, and spin-coated at 3,000 rpm for 30 s. The films were annealed at 200 °C for 1 h. TiO 2
FTO glass substrates were dipped in a TiCl 4
(230 mM in deionized water) solution at 70 °C for 1 h. The substrates for depositing TiO 2
were annealed for 1 h at 150 °C. Device fabrication Perovskite precursor solutions (FAPbI 3 :0.38MDACl 2 ) with a small amount of KI as a dopant were prepared using a previously reported method 20 . Perovskite layers were spin-coated onto the substrate of various ETLs at 1,000 rpm for 10 s and 5,000 rpm for 15 s, and 1 ml of ethyl ether was dripped onto the substrate during the spinning. All perovskite layers were first heat-treated at 120 °C for 1 h. After cooling the perovskite-coated substrate, 16 mM of MeO-PEAI solution dissolved in 2-propanol was spin-coated at 5,000 rpm and annealed at 100 °C for 5 min. The Spiro-OMeTAD solution, which was prepared by mixing 90 mg ml −1
of Spiro-OMeTAD in chlorobenzene with 39.5 μl of
t -BP, 23 μl of Li-TFSI salt (520 mg ml −1
in ACN) and 10 μl of Co-TFSI salt (375 mg ml −1
in ACN), was spin-coated at 3,000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 70-nm-thick gold counter electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation. Characterization The optical properties of the perovskite films and various ETLs on FTO were measured using UV–vis spectroscopy (Shimadzu UV-2600). The crystal structure was analysed using X-ray diffraction (D/MAX2500V/PC). Steady-state photoluminescence spectra and time-correlated single-photon counting for time-resolved photoluminescence of perovskite films and various ETLs on FTO substrate and perovskite films with and without ETLs on glass substrate were recorded using a FluoTime 300 (PicoQuant) equipped with a PMA-C-192-M detector, high-resolution excitation monochromator and hybrid photomultiplier detector assembly (PMA Hybrid 40, PicoQuant). The
J – V
characteristics of the devices were measured using a Keithley 2420 source meter under illumination by a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Sol3A class AAA) with an AM 1.5 filter and an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm −2 . The active area was determined by a metal mask placed in front of the solar cell to avoid overestimation of the photocurrent density. A spectral mismatch factor of 1.05 was used for all
J – V
measurements. For the measurement of high-efficiency devices, an antireflective coating was applied to the surface 36 . The external quantum efficiency was measured using an internal quantum efficiency system (Oriel, IQE 200B) under irradiation by a 100-W xenon lamp. The thermally stimulated current (TSC) measurement was performed on the actual solar cell structure and the TSC signal was measured in a closed-cycle He cryostat. The sample was cooled to 30 K in the dark and then exposed to light for 10 min to generate photocarriers. A Xe lamp (254 W) was used as a light source, and the distance between the light source and solar cell device was fixed at 33 cm. After a dwelling time of 10 min in the dark, the sample was heated to 300 K at a rate of 17 K min −1 . The TSC signal of the samples was measured using a Keithley 2636B source meter with zero bias. ToF-SIMS measurements ToF-SIMS profiling was used to measure the depth distributions of Cl −
ions with the perovskite/SnO 2
on the FTO substrate. The samples were analysed using a ToF-SIMS V instrument (IONTOF) with a Bi +
primary beam (25 keV and 1 pA) and Cs +
sputter beam (0.25 keV and 12 nA). The sputter size was 200 μm × 200 μm, the analysis areas were 100 μm × 100 μm (for depth profiling) and 500 μm × 500 μm (for surface analysis), and the area dosage of ions was PIDD 2.48e +14 . XAFS measurements Specimens for XAFS analysis were prepared by diluting Cl-cPP or Cl − -ion-free perovskite precursors, coating them to a thickness of about 20 nm on Cl-bSO or SnO 2 , and annealing at 120 °C for 1 h. Sn K-edge X-ray absorption spectra, and extended XAFS (EXAFS) were collected on the BL10C beam line (WEXAFS) at the Pohang Light Source (PLS-II) using top-up mode operation under a ring current of 250 mA at 3.0 GeV. From the high-intensity X-ray photons of the multipole wiggler source, monochromatic X-ray beams could be obtained using a liquid-nitrogen-cooled double-crystal monochromator (Bruker ASC) with a Si(311) crystal pair. All X-ray absorption spectra were recorded in fluorescence mode using N 2 /Ar mixed gas-filled ionization chamber (IC-SPEC, FMB Oxford) and passivated implanted planar silicon (PIPS, Canberra) for the incident and fluorescent X-ray photons, respectively. Higher-order harmonic contaminations were eliminated by detuning to reduce the incident X-ray intensity by about 30%. For all samples coated on the glass, grazing-incident XAFS experiments were performed using an incident X-ray with vertical width of 100 μm and a grazing incidence of 0.5° to obtain surface-sensitive local structure around Sn in the interface. Energy calibration was simultaneously performed for each measurement with a reference Sn foil in front of the third ion chamber using partially by-passed X-ray. Using the UWXAFS package, Fourier-transformed radial distribution functions of
k 2 -weighted Sn K-edge EXAFS spectra,
k 2 χ ( k ), were obtained in the
k
range between 2.5 Å −1
and 12.0 Å −1
through a standard XAFS data analysis process. Also, Morlet wavelet-transformed EXAFS spectra were obtained with proper values of
η ,  σ  and  α
in $$\phi (t)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2{\rm{\pi }}}\sigma }({{\rm{e}}}^{i\eta t}-{{\rm{e}}}^{-{\eta }^{2}{\sigma }^{2}/2}){{\rm{e}}}^{-{t}^{2}/(2{\alpha }^{2})},$$ where
η
is the frequency of the oscillation functions,
σ
is the half-width and  α
is the angle. GI-WAXD measurements Specimens for GI-WAXD analysis are the same as for XAFS. Synchrotron-based GI-WAXD measurements were performed at the PLS-II 6D UNIST-PAL beamline of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL), Korea. The X-rays from the bending magnet were monochromatized to 18.986 keV (wavelength,
λ  = 0.6530 Å) using a double-crystal monochromator, which was focused both horizontally and vertically (90(V) μm × 120(H) μm for the full-width at half-maximum) at the sample position using a sagittal Si(111) crystal and a toroidal mirror, respectively. The GI-WAXD sample chamber was equipped with a 5-axis motorized stage for fine sample alignment and the 2D GI-WAXD pattern was recorded with a 2D CCD detector (MX 225-HS, Rayonix LLC). The diffraction angles were calibrated using NIST SRM660b (lanthanum hexaboride, LaB 6 ) and the sample-to-detector distance was 244.02 mm. An incidence angle of 0.12° was used for the GI-WAXD experiments to obtain crystallographic information about the overall thickness of the perovskite films used in this work. Under this condition, penetration depth is around 32.5 nm, as shown in Supplementary Fig.
9 . HR-TEM The interlayer images and crystal properties were observed using HR-TEM (JEM-2100F). To analyse specific local properties, the samples for the HR-TEM measurements were prepared using a focused ion beam (FIB; Helios NanoLab 450 model, FEI) milling process. ImageJ and Gatan’s digital micrograph program were used to analyse the HR-TEM images. SEM The surface morphology and thicknesses of the Cl-bSO-based devices were measured at ×50.0K magnification via SEM (Cold FE-SEM SU-8220, Hitachi High-Technologies) with a beam power of 5.0 kV. Theoretical calculations Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange-correlation functional 39
and Tkatchenko–Scheffler dispersion correction 40
using the Vienna ab initio simulation package 41 . Structural geometry optimization was performed with energy convergence and force convergence of 10 −6
eV and 0.02 eV Å −1 , respectively. We used a Γ-centred (2 × 2 × 1)
k -point mesh to sample the Brillouin zone and 560-eV energy cut-off for the projector augmented wave method (PAW) plane-wave basis sets. Here, PAW is a technique used in ab initio electronic structure calculations. We used a
\(\sqrt{2}\times \sqrt{2}\)
supercell of (001)-plane rutile SnO 2 , rutile TiO 2 , and unit cell of (001)-plane cubic FAPbI 3
surfaces. The slab consists of five symmetric layers of SnO 2
or TiO 2
and three of FAPbI 3 , with a vacuum size of about 40 Å. For Cl multilayered structures, the slab consists of two symmetric layers of SnO 2
and two of FAPbI 3 . For Cl monolayered structures, the slab consists of five symmetric layers of TiO 2
and three of FAPbI 3 . Device stability testing The stability test at the continuous maximum power point tracking device operation under 1 Sun illumination (xenon lamp (450 watt), 100 mW cm −2 , AM 1.5G) for the unencapsulated PSCs was performed under ambient and inert atmosphere (N 2 ) using ISOS-L-1I protocol 38 .

Abstract Metal halide perovskite solar cells have demonstrated a high power conversion efficiency (PCE), and further enhancement of the PCE requires a reduction of the bandgap-voltage offset ( W OC ) and the non-radiative recombination photovoltage loss (Δ V OC,nr ). Here, we report an effective approach for reducing the photovoltage loss through the simultaneous passivation of internal bulk defects and dimensionally graded two-dimensional perovskite interface defects. Through this dimensionally graded perovskite formation approach, an open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 1.24 V was obtained with a champion PCE of 21.54% in a 1.63 eV perovskite system (maximum
V OC  = 1.25 V,
W OC  = 0.38 V and Δ V OC,nr  = 0.10 V); we further decreased the
W OC
to 0.326 V in a 1.53 eV perovskite system with a
V OC
of 1.21 V and a PCE of 23.78% (certified 23.09%). This approach is equally effective in achieving a low
W OC
(Δ V OC,nr ) in 1.56 eV and 1.73 eV perovskite solar cell systems, and further leads to the substantially improved operational stability of perovskite solar cells.

Main Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on three-dimensional (3D) perovskite absorbers have achieved rapid progress with PCE values of over 25% due to the outstanding optoelectronic properties of 3D perovskites. Nevertheless, their poor stability, particularly their susceptibility in humid environments, lack of thermal stability and light-soaking degradation, is a major shortcoming that limits their further practical application. As the bandgap-voltage offset values of PSCs are still higher than that of GaAs cells ( W OC  ≈ 0.3 V), 1
reducing the
W OC
and pushing the open-circuit voltage of PSCs towards the Shockley–Queisser
V OC
limit (where there is radiative recombination loss only) is of great significance for boosting the PCE, as well as for understanding the fundamental science more deeply 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 . Several studies have shown that non-radiative recombination via defects at the interfaces between the perovskite and charge-transport layers is the main source of voltage losses for PSCs 7 , 8 , 9 . Strategies such as surface passivation or the use of processing additives have been explored to minimize non-radiative recombination losses at interfaces and thus improve the open-circuit voltage of devices 10 , 11 . For example, surfaces and grain boundaries with potassium passivation have been shown to enable the substantial mitigation of non-radiative recombination losses (Δ V OC,nr ), pushing the
V OC
value up to 1.17 V with a low
W OC
of 0.39 V (Δ V OC,nr  = 0.11 V) for a 1.56-eV-bandgap 3D perovskite system. However, there are still substantial non-radiative losses produced from trap states within the perovskite bulk film, which limits the performance and stability of the perovskite device 12 . In addition, the energy-level alignment at the interface is also a key factor for minimizing the interfacial non-radiative recombination, which requires careful interface design 13 . Thus, a simultaneous interface and bulk trap passivation strategy as well as interface engineering are required to further reach the full thermodynamic potential of the open-circuit voltage. In this work, we introduced a multifunctional (bulk and interface) 2D perovskite passivation approach and graded interface design to reduce the photovoltage loss of the PSC and enhance the device stability.
n -Butylammonium bromide (BABr) was first coated on top of a 3D perovskite film, and through thermal driving we simultaneously achieved a relatively uniform distribution of self-passivated 2D/3D perovskites in the bulk, covered by graded mixed-dimensional, wider-bandgap 2D perovskite layers. We name it the dimensionally graded perovskite formation (DGPF) approach. This multifunctional approach effectively suppresses the non-radiative recombination loss in both the bulk and at the interface of the perovskite. Via this DGPF technique, we demonstrate a hysteresis-free maximum PCE of 21.54% with a high
V OC
of 1.24 V in a 1.63 eV perovskite system, and the
W OC
is only 0.39 V, which is equivalent to a non-radiative recombination
V OC
loss (Δ V OC,nr ) of only 0.11 V. In particular, a minimum
W OC
of 0.38 V and a Δ V OC,nr
of 0.10 V was achieved in a 20.15% PCE device. We further decrease the
W OC
to as low as 0.326 V in an approximately 1.53 eV perovskite system (Δ V OC,nr  = 74 mV), with a maximum
V OC
of 1.21 V and a champion PCE of 23.78% (a certified PCE of 23.09%). The DGPF approach is also validated by examining hybrid PSCs with bandgaps of 1.56 eV and 1.73 eV, where very low
W OC
(Δ V OC,nr ) and high
V OC
values were both achieved. At the same time, the 2D perovskite components in the bulk and at the interface provide superb stability under illumination, ensuring that the DGPF device can maintain 91% of its initial efficiency over 500 h of 1-Sun illumination under maximum power point (MPP) conditions. Design strategy and characterization of DGPF perovskite films Figure
1a
shows the schematic illustration of our DGPF method, and Fig.
1b
shows a cross-sectional high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of the DGPF perovskite film deposited on the SnO 2 -coated indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate, verifying the homogeneity of the 2D perovskite layer on the top of the 3D perovskite film 14 . The RbCsMAFA quadruple-cation 3D perovskite film, where MA is methylammonium and FA is formamidinium, was formed using an antisolvent-assisted one-step method 15 ; this four-component system has demonstrated a state-of-the-art device performance in several studies reported by researchers at EPFL 15 , 16 , 17 . The quadruple-cation perovskite system has shown not only a high efficiency, but also a higher
V OC
value (1.16–1.18 V) than a triple-cation (~1.13 V) counterpart (both have a bandgap of around 1.63 eV) 15 , 16 , 17 . The detailed fabrication method of the device is given in the
Methods
section. Here, to form the mixed 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction films, long-chain BABr molecules were first dissolved in isopropyl alcohol, at different concentrations, and then spin coated directly onto the top of the as-prepared 3D RbCsMAFA perovskite film to form a thin film; this was then followed by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. This approach leads to the perovskite vertical composition distribution shown below.

c , ToF-SIMS depth profile of the DGPF perovskite film deposited on an ITO substrate. The dark green and light green shaded regions are the surface and bulk of perovskite films, respectively. Full size image To investigate the distribution of ions inside the perovskite films after the introduction of BABr, we conducted time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) measurements on the DGPF perovskite films. The ToF-SIMS depth profile shown in Fig.
1c
reveals the gradient distribution of BA +
with the initial sputtering time, which indicates that the ultrathin 2D perovskite film was formed on the surface of the 3D perovskite layer. In the bulk (originally pure 3D) perovskite film, we now observe a relatively uniform distribution of BA +
with an intensity of over two orders of magnitude lower than that on the surface, indicating a clear diffusion process. Therefore, it is evident that the bulk film contains both 3D and 2D perovskite with an increasing 2D concentration towards the surface. Owing to the gradient distribution of BA + , the number of layers ( n ) of the 2D perovskite might increase from the surface to the bulk, creating a tendency for bandgap narrowing (as illustrated in Fig.
1a
and Supplementary Fig.
10b ). The grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) technique was used to study the crystal orientation of the control and mixed DGPF perovskite films 18 . The scattering patterns of the perovskite films with various concentrations of BABr are shown in Fig.
2a . The corresponding radial intensity profiles averaged over the whole images are presented in Fig.
2b . The standard pure 3D perovskite film (0-BABr) displays uniform diffraction rings, indicating the formation of perovskite polycrystals with a randomly oriented cubic structure. For the perovskite films with the BABr post-treatment, sharp diffraction peaks emerged at scattering vector
q
values of 0.32, 0.64 and 0.96 Å −1
along the
z
direction (Fig.
2c ), which are indexed as the (020), (040) and (060) planes of layered 2D perovskite crystals parallel to the substrate with a layer spacing,
d , of ~20 Å ( n  = 2) 19 . The parallel 2D perovskite orientation is surprising as it is commonly considered to be unfavoured for overall vertical charge transport in solar-cell devices. However, the high-efficiency PSC in this study indicates that the 2D perovskite layer with a relatively larger bandgap is thin enough for carrier transport and can act as an effective electron-blocking layer to suppress the interfacial charge recombination. The BABr GIWAXS peak appearing at
q z  = 0.41 Å −1
in the pure BABr film (Supplementary Fig.
1a ) and the excess PbI 2
peak appearing at
q z  = 0.92 Å −1
in the 3D perovskite film were both absent, suggesting that 2D perovskite layers are partially formed from the reaction of BABr with excess PbI 2 . When the concentration of BABr is increased, the 2D perovskite peaks become more intense, as the higher order (080) peak appears with the 5 mg ml −1
BABr treatment. Fig. 2: Crystallinity and morphology of the perovskite films. a , 2D GIWAXS patterns of the control (0 mg ml −1

c , Intensity profiles along the

axis.
d , Schematic of 2D/3D perovskite film formed via the DGPF method. A thin 2D perovskite capping layer with mixed-dimensionality is formed on top of the 3D perovskite film, and the 2D perovskite phase can be further produced between the grain boundaries of the 3D counterparts leading to the formation of the mixed 2D/3D perovskite.
e , Top-view SEM (upper) and surface AFM (lower) images of the control and DGPF perovskite films with different BABr concentrations. Full size image To provide more detailed evidence of the graded 2D perovskite from the surface to the bulk, we conducted GIWAXS analysis at different X-ray incident angles to elucidate the vertical structure of the surface and internal perovskite layers with depth-dependent characterization, as shown in Supplementary Fig.
2 . The structure information of the perovskite film surface was recorded at a small incident angle of 0.1°, which shows the formation of a 2D perovskite layer with
n  = 2 only. When the angle of incidence was increased to 0.3°, we clearly observed some additional diffraction peaks, which are assigned to be the (0 k 0) plane of the 2D perovskite with
n  = 3. With increasing the incident angle and penetration depth, the diffraction peak intensity of the 2D perovskite with
n  = 2 and 3 gradually increased. We can also clearly distinguish the (222) plane of the 2D perovskite with
n  = 2, 3 and 4 at an incident angle of 1°. Thus, the depth-dependent GIWAXS results are in good agreement with our hypothesis of graded top 2D perovskite layers with increasing
n
values for top-down distribution. To further evaluate the structural properties of the DGPF perovskite films, we performed HRTEM measurements using the focused ion beam (FIB) lift-out technique shown in Supplementary Fig.
3 , which allows the crystal structure to be probed throughout the perovskite film. Here, we selected two regions (1 and 2), which correspond to the top surface and the bulk, respectively. Region 1 (the top surface) shows lattice fringes with a characteristic
d
spacing of 13 Å, which can be ascribed to 2D perovskite phases with
n  = 1. In Region 2 (the bulk film), we can observe the characteristic
d
spacing of the 3D perovskite phase (3.2 Å). Besides, it is worth noting that the 2D perovskite phases with
n  = 2 and 3 were embedded within the 3D perovskite phases, which are probably located at the grain boundary. The influence of the annealing time on the perovskite film was also investigated, as shown in Supplementary Fig.
1 . The 2D perovskite signals remain almost the same for the samples with and without annealing, whereas the 3D perovskite signals become stronger with a longer annealing time. The diffraction peaks shift towards larger
q
values, indicating a slight lattice contraction 20 . This is attributed to substitution of the larger I −
ions with the smaller Br −
ions in the 3D perovskite crystals. The longer the annealing time, the more BABr diffuses into the bulk film, causing a larger lattice contraction, which is consistent with the ToF-SIMS results. Therefore, as illustrated in Fig.
2d , upon BABr post-treatment, BA +
and Br −
ions tend to fill the vacancies at the grain boundaries of the 3D perovskite due to the strong reactivity of the introduced BA +
and Br −
ions with existing dangling bonds 21 . In this case, the 2D perovskite phases are most likely to form at the grain boundaries surrounding the 3D perovskite phases. The 2D perovskite will heal and passivate the 3D perovskite defects, notably reducing the non-radiative recombination, which is in agreement with the observed lower
V OC
loss presented in the following text. The perovskite film morphology is another critical factor for the photovoltaic performance. Top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the control and DGPF perovskite films are shown in Fig.
2e . The morphology of the control RbCsMAFA perovskite film is uniform and compact with well-crystallized grains, which is in good agreement with a previous study 15 . With BABr treatment, an obvious grain-coarsening process is observed, that is, the original small perovskite grains were merged into larger ones via a thermodynamically spontaneous Ostwald ripening process 22 . We expected that the BABr molecules would gradually penetrate into the existing 3D perovskite crystalline structure, resulting in the formation of thin 2D perovskite phases on the top and in the bulk of the mixed 2D/3D perovskites film. When a low concentration of BABr solution is used (1 or 2 mg ml −1 ), we observe both large and small grains. It is reasonable to expect that in the low-concentration cases, the amount of BABr is not sufficient for recrystallizing all of the small-grain-sized 3D perovskite crystals. With a further increase in the BABr concentration to 5 mg ml −1 , the surface morphology becomes smoother with uniformly distributed grain sizes. Device performance and characterization Photovoltaic devices were fabricated using spiro-OMeTAD as a hole-selective layer and gold as the counter electrode. The current density–voltage ( J–V ) curves of the champion control and DGPF PSCs are shown in Fig.
3a . The control RbCsMAFA-based planar PSC device shows a decent champion PCE of 19.61% with a short-circuit current density ( J SC ) of 22.25 mA cm −2 , a
V OC
of 1.161 V and a fill factor (FF) of 75.92%. Compared with the data on mesoporous PSCs reported by the researchers at EPFL, the
V OC
and
J SC
values are very similar, whereas the FF is lower (0.76 versus 0.81). After BABr treatment, the DGPF PSC shows a clear performance enhancement, yielding a champion PCE of 20.24% when using 1 mg ml −1
BABr and 21.54% when using 2 mg ml −1
BABr, with an impressive
V OC
of 1.24 V (Fig.
3a
and Supplementary Fig.
4 ). We fabricated 20 individual devices for both control and DGPF PSCs at 2 mg ml − 1
BABr. The statistics of two types of devices are shown in Supplementary Fig.
5 , which indicates good reproducibility in the DGPF PSCs with an improved PCE of 20.38% (± 0.38%) on average compared with 18.80% (± 0.31%) in the control PSCs. There is a much enhanced average
V OC
of 1.22 V (± 0.02 V) in the DGPF PSCs, compared with 1.15 V (± 0.02 V) in the pure 3D PSCs, and this is the major factor contributing to the overall efficiency enhancement. Considering the very similar optical bandgap values for the control and DGPF perovskite films, the driving force of the high
V OC
value with a small
W OC
for the DGPF PSCs is of great interest. Fig. 3: Photovoltaic performance and optoelectronic properties of the PSCs. a ,

as a function of the injection current density for the control and DGPF-based PSCs when operating as LEDs. Full size image The external quantum efficiency (EQE) data of the PSCs with different BABr concentrations are shown in Supplementary Fig.
4b . As expected, the EQE spectrum is slightly blue shifted when BABr is incorporated, although this is very small and does not lead to a reduction of the
J SC . We observed a better photoresponse in the long-wavelength range for the devices treated with BABr solutions, which may originate from enhanced charge transport 23 . For the RbCsMAFA system, when using an optimized BABr solution concentration of 2 mg ml −1 , the cell is hysteresis-free (as shown in Fig.
3a ) with a PCE of 21.54%, and the stabilized PCE is 21.27% (as shown in Supplementary Fig.
6 ). Here, we also compared the results of some PSCs with a PCE of over 21%, where the
W OC
varies from 0.39 to 0.48 V, and where our DGPF device compares favourably amongst them (Supplementary Fig.
7
and Supplementary Table
3 ) 15 , 24 . Elucidating DGPF PSC
V
OC
loss mechanisms To understand the reason of the high
V OC
in these PSCs in a quantitative manner, the accurate determination of the perovskite bandgap is critical. As shown in Supplementary Fig.
8 , the determination of optical bandgap ( E g ) values was conducted using two widely recognized methods: (1) using the maximum point of the derivative of the EQE spectrum (that is dEQE/d E ) 25
and (2) using the Tauc plot 26 . The
E g
values from the two methods agree very well. We first examine the electroluminescence (EL) efficiency. The reciprocity relation can describe the relationship between the photovoltaic quantum efficiency (EQE PV ) and the external quantum efficiency of the electroluminescence (EQE EL ), which can be used to quantify the
V OC
loss in photovoltaic devices 27 . According to Rau,
\({\Phi}_{{\mathrm{EL}}}\left( E \right) = \varphi _{{\mathrm{BB}}}\left( E \right){\mathrm{EQE}}_{{\mathrm{PV}}}\left( E \right)\left[ {\exp \left( {\frac{{qV}}{{kT}}} \right) - 1} \right]\) , where
\(\varphi _{{\mathrm{BB}}}\left( E \right)\)
is the black-body emission flux density,
\({\Phi}_{{\mathrm{EL}}}\left( E \right)\)
is the EL spectral photon flux ( \({\Phi}_{{\mathrm{EL}}}\left( E \right) = \frac{{J_{{\mathrm{inj}}}(V)}}{q}{\mathrm{EQE}}_{{\mathrm{EL}}}(E)\) ),
J inj ( V ) is the injected current,
V
is the applied internal voltage,
k
is the the Boltzmann constant,
T
is the temperature, and
q
is the elementary charge. As shown in Fig.
3b , the extracted EQE PV
exhibited a nearly exact dependence on the energy as the measured EQE PV , implying that the reciprocity relation holds. Herein, we identify the origins of the increased open-circuit voltage in the DGPF PSCs by quantifying the dominating recombination mechanisms. The
V OC,rad
describes the radiative limit of
V OC , which is determined by
\(V_{{\mathrm{OC,rad}}} = \frac{{kT}}{q}\ln \left[ {\frac{{J_{{\mathrm{SC}}}}}{{\mathop {\smallint }\nolimits_0^\infty {\mathrm{EQE}}_{{\mathrm{PV}}}(E)\varphi _{{\mathrm{BB}}}\left( E \right){\mathrm{d}}E}} + 1} \right]\)
(ref.
6 ). The calculated
V OC,rad
value is 1.35 V for both the reference control and DGPF perovskite devices, both with almost the same 1.63 eV bandgap 28 . Therefore, the difference in the non-radiative recombination losses is the source of the
V OC
enhancement. We then quantify the non-radiative recombination voltage loss (Δ V OC,nr ), which in principle can be estimated from the measured EQE EL
using the relationship
\({\Delta}V_{{\mathrm{OC,nr}}} = V_{{\mathrm{OC,rad}}} - V_{{\mathrm{OC}}} = - \frac{{kT}}{q}\ln \,{\mathrm{EQE}}_{{\mathrm{EL}}}\) . An EQE EL
value of 0.85% was measured for a DGPF PSC device under light-emitting diode (LED) mode with a forward-bias current density of 22.22 mA cm −2
(Fig.
3c ). This EQE EL
value is very close that of the most efficient silicon solar cell (~0.5%) 29 . This is also one of the highest values obtained in PSCs. The 0.85% EQE EL
corresponds to a Δ V OC,nr
value of 0.12 V (refs.
15 , 30 ), which agrees well with the device parameter ( V OC  = 1.23 V for the tested device). For the champion efficiency device with a
V OC
of 1.24 V, the EQE EL
value should be higher and the Δ V OC,nr
will be 0.11 V. The maximum
V OC
of 1.25 V with the 20.15% PCE for the DGPF PSC device indicates a Δ V OC,nr
value of 100 mV (Supplementary Fig.
9 ). On the other hand, the control PSC has a
V OC
of 1.16 V. Under the forward-bias LED mode with the same injected current density of 22.22 mA cm −2 , the PSC delivers an EQE EL
of 0.065% (corresponding to a Δ V OC,nr
value of 0.19 V from the equation), which also agrees well with the device
V OC
loss analysis. The extraordinarily low non-radiative recombination losses in DGPF PSCs are the dominating reason behind the high
V OC
as well as the high efficiencies in these PSC devices. Generally, these non-radiative recombination losses arise from defects (charge-carrier traps) either in the bulk photovoltaic materials or at the interfaces. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) on the 3D perovskite films with different BABr concentrations was carried out to understand the electronic properties of the films. Supplementary Fig.
10a
shows the cutoff energy ( E cutoff ) in the high-binding-energy region and the valence band with respect to the vacuum level derived from the UPS spectra. With the increase in BABr concentration, the
E cutoff
shifts to a higher binding energy, indicating that the ion-exchange-induced 3D to 2D phase transition can reduce the Fermi level of RbCsMAFA 19 . The valence-band edges determined from the linear portion in the low-binding-energy region for 0-BABr, 1-BABr, 2-BABr and 5-BABr are located at 5.86, 5.80, 5.74 and 5.70 eV, respectively. Here, to mimic a similar situation, thinner 3D perovskite films (at around 100 nm) with and without BABr treatment are used to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. The absorption spectra of the thin control and DGPF perovskite films are shown in Supplementary Fig.
11 . It is noteworthy that the absorption peaks can be observed at 2.27, 2.05 and 1.81 eV, which are assigned to 2D perovskites with
n  = 2, 3 and 4, respectively. As discussed above, the depth-dependent GIWAXS data also confirmed this graded distribution. The top-down structure information shows that the 2D perovskites with a small
n
value ( n  = 2) are prone exist near the surface. Owing to the graded distribution of BA +
in the 2D perovskite region (Fig.
1c ), the energy diagram at the perovskite/hole-transport layer interface can be estimated 31 . As shown in Supplementary Fig.
10b , the energy diagram of a perovskite with a gradient energy structure distribution for the 2 mg ml −1
BABr-treated case is depicted. Compared with the pure 3D perovskite device, the graded 2D perovskites lead to a graded energy-level transition from the bulk 3D perovskite to the 2D perovskite. The energy-level shift is not linear, as envisioned from the BA +
spatial distribution. We can expect that the energy-level gradient is smooth close to bulk perovskite, but the gradient is much faster when reaching the spiro-OMeTAD hole-transport layer side. Therefore, the aforementioned graded 2D perovskite layer can be regarded as having the same function as the graded window layer in traditional thin-film solar cells, which provides a potential barrier for the electrons 32 . The electrons moving towards the perovskite top surface (where the trap-state density is higher than that in the bulk) will be reflected back close to the interface. Hence, this energy-level alignment will further eliminate the surface recombination effectively. In the meantime, the mildly graded valence-band energy-level-alignment transition can also facilitate efficient hole transport from the perovskite to the hole-transport-layer material. Photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL measurements were conducted for the various perovskite films to examine the defect-passivation effect (Supplementary Fig.
12 ). For the DGPF perovskite films, in addition to a notable PL intensity enhancement, we observed a slight blue shift of the PL peaks, which agree with the scenario of the substitution of I −
with Br −
and the resulting shrinkage of the 3D crystal lattice. The carrier lifetime of the control perovskite film was substantially increased in the self-passivated DGPF perovskite films. All DGPF perovskite films exhibit a long exponential PL decay tail with PL lifetimes of above 1 µs (in particular, a PL lifetime of 1.86 µs was obtained for the 2-BABr sample), in contrast with the shorter lifetime (0.76 µs) for the control perovskite film. This is consistent with the higher voltages shown in Fig.
3c
for the DGPF perovskite device in which the defects were effectively passivated 33 . Furthermore, we measure the external PL quantum efficiency (PLQE) for the perovskite films with different contacts. The geometry of the PL measurements is shown in Supplementary Fig.
13 , in which the light excitation is either from top- or bottom-side. Here we used an incident laser with a wavelength of 485 nm, which has a penetration depth of less than 100 nm according to Snell’s law, and which implies that we can mainly collect the PL signal near the top surface of the perovskite film under the front excitation 34 . The PLQE of the DGPF perovskite film deposited on the glass reaches a value of 13.58%, whereas it is only 4.65% for the control perovskite film. In the presence of charge-selective contacts (electrons or holes), the PLQE values for both the control and DGPF perovskite films decrease, which can be ascribed to the quenching effect and the introduction of non-radiative channels at the contact interface 35 . We again observe that the DGPF approach enables a less notable reduction in PLQE in the presence of selective contacts. In the case of light excitation from either the top or the bottom, the higher PLQEs for the DGPF perovskite samples suggest that the optoelectronic properties of the perovskite film as well as its related interfaces and surfaces can be optimized via the DGPF method. The highly sensitive photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS) technique was used to study the sub-bandgap/trap-state absorption and energetic disorder in these samples 36 . A decrease in sub-bandgap absorption determined using PDS is clearly seen in the DGPF perovskite films, indicating reduced sub-bandgap states (trap states). The presence of electronic sub-bandgap trap states is one of the origins of non-radiative recombination pathways 37 , 38 . The internal passivation derived from participation of the 2D perovskite in the final DGPF perovskite film can effectively suppress non-radiative recombination to incur minimal voltage losses. The PDS results come with a characteristic Urbach energy. The Urbach energy values, estimated from the PDS spectra, are 20.55, 19.7, 19.9 and 23.21 meV for samples treated with BABr concentrations of 0, 1, 2 and 5 mg ml −1 , respectively (Supplementary Fig.
14 ). The lower Urbach energy indicates a lower level of electronic disorder in the perovskite films with a low concentration of BABr treatment, which agrees with the enhancement of
V OC
(ref.
39 ). When increasing the BABr concentration to 5 mg ml −1 , we observe a slight band-edge absorption rise, indicating increased energy disorder. As the inherent Urbach energy in a 2D perovskite is higher compared with its 3D counterpart, this is expected and is also consistent with the decreasing device performance when treating with a higher BABr concentration. The PDS results for a 2D perovskite are shown in Supplementary Fig.
15 , which shows that the Urbach energy of the 2D perovskite is 38.4 meV. Generality of DGPF strategy in PSCs We further performed electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the passivation mechanism at the BA/perovskite interface. The surface terminated with the (110) plane was used for the calculations. Charge-density calculations based on DFT were performed to characterize how an amine, including the BA molecule, can passivate the Cs 0.125 FA 0.875 Pb(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3
surfaces. Modelling shows that antisite defects such as Pb Br
or Pb I , known as deep-level defects, are the most detrimental defects in PSCs 40 . As illustrated in Supplementary Fig.
16 , the charge distribution is localized around the antisite defect site, which can produce the recombination centre and capture the carriers. After interaction with the BA moiety, we first find that the nitrogen will bond with lead atoms and then the previous antisite defect can be passivated, as shown in Supplementary Fig.
16c , like the perfect surface without any defects indicated by Supplementary Fig.
16b . Without the BA dopant, the localized electron distribution is observed clearly in Supplementary Fig.
16a . The adsorption of BA will make the charge distribution delocalized, indicating that the trap states caused by antisite defects are passivated. The trap density of states of the control and DGPF devices is further examined and shows a much lower trap density of states in the DGPF devices, which is consistent with the DFT calculations (Supplementary Fig.
17 ). The effectiveness of the DGPF approach has been validated in more perovskite systems. In the double-cation MA 0.7 FA 0.3 PbI 3
perovskite system, X-ray diffraction measurements were conducted to analyse the crystal structure of the formed DGPF perovskite film (Supplementary Fig.
18 ). The perovskite film shows a slight peak shift towards higher 2 θ
values, which is consistent with findings from the quadruple-cation RbCsMAFA perovskite system. The GIWAXS results in Supplementary Fig.
19
clearly show the 2D diffractive peaks for the BABr-treated samples. The formed 2D perovskite top layer consists of layered 2D perovskites with different
n
values ( n  = 2 and 3). The device performance based on this narrower-bandgap perovskite (MA 0.7 FA 0.3 PbI 3 ,
E g  = 1.55 eV) is shown in Supplementary Fig.
20 . The best-performing MA 0.7 FA 0.3 PbI 3
PSC with post-treatment of BABr ( E g  = 1.56 eV) at 2 mg ml −1
exhibits a
V OC
value of 1.161 V, a
J SC
of 22.95 mA cm −2
and a FF of 77.67%, featuring a high PCE of 20.67%. For comparison, the control pure 3D device has a lower PCE of 18.59%. The significantly enhanced
V OC
for the DGPF PSCs is associated with a clearly reduced
V OC
deficit, that is, a
W OC
value of 0.40 V. This method was also tested in wide-bandgap mixed-cation lead PSCs, which have the significance of being potentially ideal wide-bandgap subcells for tandem perovskite PSCs towards higher efficiency 41 , 42 . By means of the DGPF approach, the best-performing wide-bandgap FA 0.8 Cs 0.2 Pb(I 0.7 Br 0.3 ) 3
PSC ( E g  = 1.73 eV) has a PCE of 18.09% with a
W OC
value of 0.48 V and an outstanding
V OC
of 1.26 V (Supplementary Fig.
21 ) 43 . This again shows one of the highest
V OC
and lowest
W OC
values in ~1.73 eV bandgap PSCs, to our knowledge 44 . Hysteresis analysis of representative PSCs based on various optical bandgaps is shown in Supplementary Fig.
22
and summarized in Supplementary Table
4 . After the incorporation of BABr, devices shows lower
J – V
hysteresis compared with the control pure 3D PSC device, which is consistent with the scenario that larger BA moieties mitigate or even prohibit ion migration and reduce the above-mentioned defects. The data of voltage-loss analysis in perovskite devices with different bandgaps are summarized in Table
1 . Table 1 Photovoltaic parameters and voltage-loss analysis of the best-performing PSCs Full size table We further proved the effectiveness of the DGPF approach in a ~1.53 eV perovskite system (Cs 0.03 (FA 0.97 MA 0.03 ) 0.97 Pb(I 0.97 Br 0.03 ) 3 ) with a modified SnO 2
quantum dot (QD) electron-transport layer (ETL). A champion PCE of up to 23.78% (average PCE: 23.24 ± 0.33%, certified PCE: 23.09%; Supplementary Fig.
27 ) with a maximum
V OC
of 1.210 V (and a
W OC
value as low as 0.326 V) was achieved, as shown in Fig.
3d . The bandgap of the perovskite was calculated through the combination of EQE and UV-visible absorption spectra (see Supplementary Figs.
23
and
24 ). More details can be found in Supplementary Figs.
25 – 27
and Supplementary Table
7 . To evaluate the Δ V OC,nr , we measured the EQE EL
for a complete PSC device operating as an LED in forward-voltage bias, as shown in Fig.
3f . The DGPF device exhibited an EQE EL
of up to 5.78% at an injection current equal to a
J SC
of 24.57 mA cm −2 , corresponding to a Δ V OC,nr
of 74 mV, which agreed well with the estimated value from the
W OC . To the best of our knowledge, the
W OC
value of 0.326 V is amongst the lowest in all reported perovskite systems. Device stability In addition to the device performance, the operational stability of the PSCs is vital for PSC technology. We first investigated the long-term stability of the control and DGPF PSCs (non-encapsulated) under dark storage in ambient conditions with 30% relative humidity (RH; Supplementary Fig.
28 ). The DGPF PSCs showed a substantially enhanced resistivity to humidity, with virtually no PCE degradation after 45 days. This is attributed to the improved hydrophobicity of the perovskite structure after introduction of the large organic cation (BA). We further studied the stability of the encapsulated devices under continuous simulated sunlight illumination (~35 °C) at open-circuit (OC) conditions. The DGPF PSCs showed a much slower performance degradation compared with the pure 3D PSCs. The encapsulated DGPF PSCs retained 62% of their initial PCE after 800 h of illumination, whereas the control 3D PSCs retained only 25% of their original PCE under the same conditions (Fig.
4 ). All the device parameters recorded during the stability test (Supplementary Fig.
29a,b ) are shown in Supplementary Tables
5
and
6 . A ‘burn-in’ exponential degradation regime was clearly observed in both types of device, which is a common phenomenon for PSCs and organic solar cells 25 , 45 , 46 . More specifically, both types of PSC experienced a faster performance degradation process (up to around 100 h), followed by a slower steady degradation. For the encapsulated DGPF PSCs, the post-burn-in lifetime
T 80
value (that is, the time taken to lose 20% of the initial PCE) is 700 h under 0.8-Sun illumination. However, the
T 80
post-burn-in lifetimes for the pure 3D PSC devices are much shorter, at around 300 h. To exclude the effects of interface layers (particularly the spiro-OMeTAD hole-transport-layer material) and the electric load (under MPP or OC conditions) on the operational stability of the device, we fabricated perovskite devices with a planar p–i–n structure (Supplementary Fig.
30a,b ) and tested the long-term stability of encapsulated devices illuminated under continuous 1-Sun irradiation using an LED lamp at a temperature of ~60 °C in air, as shown in Fig.
4b 45 . Under MPP conditions, we found that both the control and DGPF devices showed clearly decreased degradation rates compared with those under OC conditions, which can be ascribed to the role of the excess charge carrier 47 , 48 . In concusion, our DGPF devices can retain 91% of their initial efficiency after 516 h of operation under continuous illumination in ambient air. In comparison, the control device retained only 16% of the original PCE under the same conditions. Fig. 4: Operational stability of the control and DGPF devices. Device-stability parameters of the control and DGPF perovskite devices with encapsulation. Data were obtained from current density–voltage scans over time for the devices.
a , The n–i–p devices are kept under a white LED array of 0.8-Sun intensity under OC conditions (20–30% RH, 35–40 °C).
b , The stability data were determined from MPP tracking of p–i–n devices illuminated using 1-Sun irradiation of an LED lamp under ambient conditions (30–40% RH, 60–65 °C). Full size image In summary, we developed a simple DGPF self-passivation strategy for high-performance PSCs, which achieved the simultaneous passivation of both bulk and interface 2D perovskites of the PSCs. The DGPF strategy dramatically boosts the PCE of 1.63 eV quadruple-cation PSCs to 21.54%, with a superb
V OC
of 1.24 V; we further improved the PCE to 23.78% (certified 23.09%) with the maximum
V OC
of 1.21 V in a ~1.53 eV perovskite system, that is, a
W OC
value as low as 0.326 V. Non-radiative recombination losses in the perovskite materials and devices can be reduced to as low as 74 mV (from EQE EL
measurements), which is one of the lowest reported so far. The method is universally applicable to PSCs of different bandgaps. Moreover, substantially enhanced operational stability is achieved via the simultaneous passivation of 2D perovskites in the bulk and at the interfaces. The DGPF approach paves the way to further approach the theoretical PSC efficiency limit via the elimination of non-radiative recombination decay, and is a step forward in achieving highly efficient PSCs with long-term operational stability. Methods Preparation of RbCsMAFA (Rb 0.05 Cs 0.05 [(FA 0.83 MA 0.17 )] 0.9 Pb(I 0.83 Br 0.17 ) 3 ) First, a non-stoichiometric precursor solution for (FA 0.83 MA 0.17 )Pb(I 0.83 Br 0.17 ) 3

(TCI), 1 M FAI (Dyesol), 0.22 M PbBr 2
and 0.2 M MABr (Dyesol) in a 4:1 (v/v) mixture (1 ml) of anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), respectively. (Please note the volume changes upon dissolving these salts.)

solution, yielding the quadruple-cation perovskite of composition Rb 0.05 Cs 0.05 [(FA 0.83 MA 0.17 )] 0.9 Pb(I 0.83 Br 0.17 ) 3 . The quadruple-cation perovskite solution was stirred for 6 h at room temperature and then filtered using a 0.45 µm filter before use. For RbCsMAFA film deposition, the perovskite precursor solution (50 µl) was spin coated onto the substrates at 1,000 and 5,000 revolutions per minute (r.p.m.) for 10 and 20 s, respectively. Chlorobenzene (105 µl) was added dropwise onto the perovskite film at 25 s from the start of the spinning process. The perovskite films were then placed on a hot plate at 100 °C for 60 min.

precursor solution contained 1.25 M PbI 2 , methylammonium iodide and formamidinium iodide (PbI 2 :MAI:FAI = 1:0.7:0.3) in a mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO (volume ratio: 4:1). Pb(SCN) 2
(12 mg; Sigma-Aldrich) was then added to the MA 0.7 FA 0.3 PbI 3
precursor solution (1 ml). For MA 0.7 FA 0.3 PbI 3
film deposition, the perovskite precursor solution (50 µl) was spin coated onto the substrates at 1,000 and 4,000 r.p.m. for 5 and 30 s, respectively. Chlorobenzene (300 µl) was added dropwise onto the perovskite film at 13–15 s from the start of the spinning process. Then the as-deposited film was annealed at 65 °C for 2 min and at 100 °C for 10 min. Preparation of FA 0.8 Cs 0.2 Pb(I 0.7 Br 0.3 ) 3
The FA 0.8 Cs 0.2 Pb(I 0.7 Br 0.3 ) 3
precursor solution contained 0.8 M FAI, 0.2 M CsI, 0.55 M PbI 2 , 0.45 M PbBr 2
and 0.55% M Pb(SCN) 2
in a mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO (volume ratio: 3:1). For FA 0.8 Cs 0.2 Pb(I 0.7 Br 0.3 ) 3

Chlorobenzene (300 µl) was added dropwise onto the perovskite film at 13–15 s from the start of the spinning process. The as-prepared film was then annealed at 65 °C for 2 min and at 100 °C for 10 min. Preparation of Cs 0.03 (FA 0.97 MA 0.03 ) 0.97 Pb(I 0.97 Br 0.03 ) 3
The Cs 0.03 (FA 0.97 MA 0.03 ) 0.97 Pb(I 0.97 Br 0.03 ) 3
precursor solution was prepared using the mixed powders of FAI:MABr:MACl:PbBr 2 :PbI 2
(molar ratio: 1.41:0.04:0.4:0.04:1.47) in a mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO (volume ratio: 4:1), blended with CsI (1.5 M; 3% volume ratio) stock solution. For Cs 0.03 (FA 0.97 MA 0.03 ) 0.97 Pb(I 0.97 Br 0.03 ) 3
film deposition, the perovskite solution (50 µl) was spin coated onto the SnO 2 -coated ITO substrate at 1,000 and 6,000 r.p.m. for 10 and 30 s, respectively. Chlorobenzene (150 µl) was added dropwise onto the perovskite film at 15–20 s from the start of the spin-coating process. The as-prepared films were annealed at 120 °C for 1 h under an ambient atmosphere with ~20% RH. For the dimensionally graded passivation method, BABr–isopropyl alcohol solution (100 μL; the concentrations ranged from 1 to 5 mg ml −1 ) was spin coated onto the as-prepared perovskite films at 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. Then the perovskite films were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. Perovskite solar cell fabrication Fabrication of n–i–p solar cells The ITO-coated glass was sequentially cleaned using deionized water, acetone and ethanol. All substrates were further cleaned via UV-ozone treatment for 15 min before deposition of the SnO 2
ETL. The SnO 2
QD ETL (30 nm thick) was deposited on the cleaned ITO substrate by spin coating with an as-prepared colloidal SnO 2
QD solution 14 . Then the as-deposited SnO 2
QD ETL was annealed on a hot plate at 200 °C for 1 h in air. The mixed-cation perovskite was deposited via a one-step spin-coating procedure as mentioned above. The spiro-OMeTAD solution (20 μl), which contained spiro-OMeTAD (72.3 mg; Lumitech),
tert -butylpyridine (28.8 μl; Sigma-Aldrich), bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (17.5 μl; LiTFSI, Sigma-Aldrich) solution (520 mg in acetonitrile) and chlorobenzene (1 ml), was spin coated onto the perovskite layer at 3,000 r.p.m. for 20 s. Finally, an 80-nm-thick layer of gold was deposited by thermal evaporation. Fabrication of p–i–n solar cells Poly(triaryl amine) solution (2 mg ml −1
in toluene) was spin coated onto the perovskite layer at 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. A 1.63 eV perovskite layer was deposited on the poly(triaryl amine) layer using the same method as based on one-step approach. Then, a 30-nm-thick C 60
layer (the ETL) and a 12-nm-thick SnO 2
layer (the buffer layer) were deposited by thermal evaporation and atomic layer deposition, respectively. Finally, a 100-nm-thick layer of copper was deposited as the top metal electrode by thermal evaporation. Solar cell characterization The current density–voltage ( J – V ) characteristics of the devices were measured using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter under standard AM1.5 G illumination (SS-F5; Enli Technology, Taiwan), and the light intensity was calibrated using a standard SRC-2020 silicon reference cell. The
J – V
curves were obtained in the range from 1.3 to −0.1 V with a scan speed of 100 mV s −1
from both reverse and forward scan directions. The active area of the device is 0.09 cm 2 , and a mask with an aperture area of 0.0625 cm 2
was used to define the device area. The stabilized output of the devices was measured by recording the current output of the illuminated device while holding it at a constant voltage near the MPP extracted from the
J–V
curve. Solar cell certification Device certification was conducted by the Enli Technology Optoelectronic Calibration Laboratory, a photovoltaic certification laboratory accredited by the Taiwan Accreditation Foundation (accreditation criteria: ISO/IEC 17025:2005). Photostability test The devices are kept under an array of white LEDs with 0.8-Sun intensities, which was calibrated using a standard silicon solar cell (KG5). The encapsulated devices were exposed to RH below 20% at ~35 °C. External quantum efficiency EQE measurements of the photovoltaic devices were carried out from 300 to 850 nm using a QE-R 3011 system (Enli Technology, Taiwan). X-ray diffraction and grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering characterization The crystal structure and phase of the materials were characterized using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku SmartLab) with Cu Kα radiation under operating conditions of 40 kV and 40 mA (with the
θ –2 θ
scan mode from 10 to 70° in steps of 0.01°). The GIWAXS measurements were carried out using a Xeuss 2.0 SAXS/WAXS laboratory beamline with a copper X-ray source (8.05 keV, 1.54 Å) and a Pilatus3 R 300K detector. The angle of incidence is 0.3°. The perovskite films for X-ray diffraction and GIWAXS characterizations were deposited on SnO 2 -coated ITO substrates. Scanning electron microscopy The morphologies and microstructures were investigated by using a TESCAN MAIA3 field emission scanning electron microscope. The perovskite films for SEM measurement were prepared on SnO 2 -coated ITO substrates. Atomic force microscopy A Bruker NanoScope 8 atomic force microscope was used to measure the height and phase profiles of the perovskite films in tapping mode. The perovskite films for AFM measurement were prepared on SnO 2 -coated ITO substrates. Photothermal deflection spectroscopy For PDS measurements, the perovskite film was deposited on a quartz substrate and then immersed into Fluorinert FC-72 (3M). A monochromatic light beam was modulated at 13 Hz by a mechanical chopper to excite the perovskite films from the quartz side. A laser was at the perpendicular side so that it was deflected periodically. A position detector, connected with a lock-in amplifier, was placed on the other side so that the beam deflection signal was measured. Time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectroscopy The perovskite films were deposited on ITO substrates for ToF-SIMS measurement. The ToF-SIMS measurements (Model TOF.SIMS 5, ION-TOF) were conducted using pulsed primary ions from a Cs +
(3 keV) liquid-metal ion gun or C 60
(10 keV) sputtering and a Bi +
pulsed primary ion beam for the analysis (25 keV). Time-resolved photoluminescence and photoluminescence spectra PL measurements of perovskite films on glass substrates were conducted using an FLSP920 spectrophotometer (Edinburgh Instruments) installed with a 485 nm picosecond pulsed diode laser excitation source with an average power of 0.15 mW. Ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra The absorption spectra of the perovskite films were measured using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Cary 5000, Varian) in the 300–850 nm wavelength range at room temperature. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy Samples for UPS measurements were prepared by depositing perovskite films on ITO conductive substrates. The UPS measurements were obtained using an XPS/UPS system (Escalab 250Xi, Thermo Scientific). Photoluminescence quantum efficiency The PLQE of the perovskite films was measured using an integrating sphere (Edinburgh instruments) with a 485 nm excitation laser (~125 mW cm −2 ) in open-air conditions. External quantum efficiency of the electroluminescence The EQE EL
of the solar cells was determined by measuring the emitted photons of the devices in all directions through an integrated sphere by using a calibrated spectrometer (QE Pro, Ocean Optics), under a constant current density provided by a Keithley 2400 source measure unit. The devices were left at room temperature in open-air conditions. Trap density of states Admittance spectra were measured by using an Agilent E4980A meter with an alternating voltage of 20 mV. The frequency dependence of the capacitance was recorded from 1 kHz to 2,000 kHz with zero bias in the dark. Transmission electron microscope characterization TEM lift-out samples were prepared via FIB polishing using a TESCAN GAIA3 FIB-SEM instrument. A covering layer of 1.5-μm-thick platinum was deposited by an electron beam. Then the TEM lamella was extracted by the FIB, which had an ion beam accelerating voltage of 30 kV and a current of 7 nA, and welded to a TEM copper grid by platinum. After that, the TEM lamella was polished to about 300 nm thick with an accelerating voltage of 30 kV and a current of 100 pA. Finally, it was thinned to electron transparency with an accelerating voltage of 5 kV and a current of 25 pA and an accelerating voltage of 2 kV and a current of 20 pA. Accelerating voltage for SEM observation and electron-beam deposition was kept at 5 kV during the whole process. The TEM lift-out sample was sent into the TEM chamber less than one minute after sample preparation. TEM observations were carried out using a JEOL ARM200CF transmission electron microscope equipped with a cold field emission electron gun and double spherical-aberration correctors (CEOS) operated at 80 kV. Density functional theory calculations All calculations were performed based on the DFT calculations using the Vienna ab initio simulation package code with the standard frozen-core projector augmented-wave method. The generalized gradient approximation of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional was employed for the exchange-correlation potential. The cutoff energy for basis functions is 400 eV and the k-point mesh was obtained using the Monkhorst–Pack method with a reasonable grid density. Atoms are fully relaxed until the Hellmann–Feynman forces on them are 0.01 eV Å −1
and the vacuum layer is 15 Å, which is long enough to reach the calculation precision. The effect of van der Waals interactions was considered using the empirical correction method proposed by Grimme (DFT-D3) with Becke–Johnson damping. Dipole correction was applied to compensate for the dipole interaction. Reporting Summary Further information on research design is available in the

Abstract Controlling the crystallinity and surface morphology of perovskite layers by methods such as solvent engineering 1 , 2
and methylammonium chloride addition 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7
is an effective strategy for achieving high-efficiency perovskite solar cells. In particular, it is essential to deposit α-formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI 3 ) perovskite thin films with few defects due to their excellent crystallinity and large grain size. Here we report the controlled crystallization of perovskite thin films with the combination of alkylammonium chlorides (RACl) added to FAPbI 3 . The δ-phase to α-phase transition of FAPbI 3
and the crystallization process and surface morphology of the perovskite thin films coated with RACl under various conditions were investigated through in situ grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. RACl added to the precursor solution was believed to be easily volatilized during coating and annealing owing to dissociation into RA 0
and HCl with deprotonation of RA +
induced by RA ⋯ H + -Cl −
binding to PbI 2
in FAPbI 3 . Thus, the type and amount of RACl determined the δ-phase to α-phase transition rate, crystallinity, preferred orientation and surface morphology of the final α-FAPbI 3 . The resulting perovskite thin layers facilitated the fabrication of perovskite solar cells with a power-conversion efficiency of 26.08% (certified 25.73%) under standard illumination.

Main So far, alkyl ammonium cations (RA + ) with longer lengths or larger ionic radii than that of formamidinium (FA + ) and methylammonium (MA + ) have been mainly used in forming one-dimensional or two-dimensional (1D or 2D) lead halide perovskites 8 , 9 , 10 , for coexisting with three-dimensional (3D) structures and defect passivation of grain boundaries and surfaces. For this purpose, iodide (I − ) or bromide (Br − ) is mainly used as a halide anion that binds to RA + . This is because the proton affinity of Cl −
ions is greater than that of I −
and Br −
ions, so that RA + Cl −
can easily dissociate into deprotonated RA 0
and H + Cl − , which can then volatilize 11 , 12 , 13 . On the basis of this volatilization, there have been many reports related to low-temperature formation, grain growth and preferential orientation of α-FAPbI 3
when perovskite thin films are deposited by adding shorter alkylammonium chloride (RACl), MACl, to the precursor solution 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 . However, there are few reports of using longer RACl such as propylammonium chloride (PACl) and butylammonium chloride (BACl) as an agent for improving perovskite crystallization and surface morphology 13 , 14 , 15 . The volatilization rate of propylamine (PA 0 ) and butylamine (BA 0 ) produced by deprotonation of PACl and BACl may be slower than that of MACl, because the boiling points of PA 0
and BA 0
are 47.8 °C and 78 °C, respectively, which are much higher than that of methylamine (MA 0 , −6.3 °C). Thus, the addition of these RACls with different physical properties is expected to have a great influence on the crystallization behaviour during the formation of perovskite thin films. Nonetheless, few studies have investigated whether the benefits of adding RACl are because of Cl −
ions, RA +
or the synergistic effects of both Cl −
ions and RA + . This work reports the understanding of the role of each RA +
and Cl −
(specifically, RACl added on the basis of MACl) in the crystallization and surface morphology of the coatings of RACl-added FAPbI 3
precursor solutions and the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) fabricated from the resulting α-FAPbI 3
thin films. Formation of α-FAPbI 3
thin films Figure
1a
shows the surface morphologies observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for the thin films formed by dripping the antisolvent during the spin-coating process of the FAPbI 3
precursor solutions with 0, 5, 10 or 15 mol% PACl added to a 35-mol% MACl base. The thin films coated with the FAPbI 3
precursor containing only 35 mol% MACl without PACl showed distinct grain boundaries. Moreover, several pinholes mixed with the residual coating medium were observed. By contrast, the grain boundaries disappeared with increasing PACl and a uniform surface morphology without pinholes was obtained. Similarly, the surface morphology of the coated thin film with further addition of 10 mol% MACl or BACl to the precursor solution containing 35 mol% MACl also improved in terms of surface uniformity (Extended Data Fig.
1a ), even though PACl was more uniform. These results indicate that the increase in RACl, which can bind to PbI 2
in FAPbI 3 , decelerates the nucleation rate of the intermediate phase induced by dripping the antisolvent. Moreover, depending on the RA +
type, a uniform thin film with large grains is formed. For fabricating α-FAPbI 3 -based high-efficiency PSCs, it is important to maintain the uniformity of the intermediate thin film, even after high-temperature heat treatment. Therefore, the as-deposited thin films were annealed at 120 °C for 40 min and then compared with the surface morphology. As shown in Fig.
1b , after annealing, all thin films were formed into very dense and pinhole-free uniform thin films, with or without non-uniformities, such as large pores observed in the as-deposited thin films. The surface morphology of the thin film coated with the precursor, to which only MACl was added, was identical to those reported in the previous study 16 . In particular, thin films coated with precursors containing 10 mol% and 15 mol% PACl exhibited an extremely flat surface morphology even after annealing compared with that of the precursors containing 10 mol% MACl or BACl (Extended Data Fig.
1b ). We further compared the surface morphology and roughness of perovskite thin films deposited with precursors containing an extra 10 mol% of RACl using atomic force microscopy (Supplementary Fig.
1 ). It was observed that the addition of 10 mol% of RACl to the FAPbI 3
precursor containing 35 mol% of MACl reduced the roughness of the thin film surface but the smoothest surface was obtained with PACl. Thus, PACl added to 35 mol% MACl plays a decisive role in improving the surface morphology, leading to improved efficiency. Figure
1c
shows the structural evolution monitored by in situ grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray diffraction (GI-WAXD) during heating from room temperature (RT) to 120 °C using the as-deposited thin films. The initial δ-FAPbI 3
thin film was converted to α-FAPbI 3
in a heating regime of approximately 60–80 °C. Notably, the as-deposited thin film coated with the precursor to which 15 mol% PACl was added contained α-FAPbI 3
and δ-FAPbI 3
at RT. Generally, α-FAPbI 3
requires a heating temperature above 150 °C to achieve a corner-shared PbI 6
octahedral structure 17 , 18 , 19 . Presumably, α-FAPbI 3
at low temperatures of 60–80 °C and even RT can be attributed to the MACl-induced kinetic effect, such as the PbI 6
octahedral rotation 20 , 21
and synergistic effect of PACl coexisting with MACl, as will be discussed later. It is known that adding 100 mol% MACl, approximately three times the amount used in this study, to the FAPbI 3
precursor produces an α phase with a crystal orientation along the (100) α
plane at RT immediately after the evaporation of the coating solvent 22 . This can be related to the formation of unstable 2D MAFAPbI 3 Cl (ref.  22 ) and coordination of Cl −
ions at the octahedra terminal corner that inhibits the face-shared octahedron, which is the δ-FAPbI 3
structure. Zhao and colleagues 23
reported that HCl promoted the δ-phase to α-phase transition at RT but the transition to the α phase at RT became similar to that with MACl only when the evaporation rate was controlled after adding 100 mol%, which was the same amount as MACl. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the content of Cl −
ions added to the perovskite precursor and the control of the release rate of Cl −
ions by RA +
to which Cl −
ions are bound are important factors determining the δ-phase to α-phase transition. Notably, in the thin film coated with the precursor to which 5 mol% and 10 mol% PACl were added, the width of the (100) α
peak ( q  ≈ 10 nm −1 ) became much broader at 60–80 °C, at which the transition to the α phase started, and disappeared as the temperature increased. The broadening of the (100) α
peak is more pronounced in a thin film containing 10 mol% PACl than that containing 5 mol% and was absent in the film with 15 mol% of PACl, which showed a large amount of α-FAPbI 3
even before annealing (Fig  1c
and Extended Data Fig.
2 ). The (100) α
peak width variation at the δ-phase to α-phase transition temperature is the greatest in thin films coated with precursors doped with 10 mol% PACl, which may provide further kinetics for crystallization into high-quality α-FAPbI 3 . Figure
1d
compares the 2D GI-WAXD of the perovskite thin films obtained after annealing the as-deposited thin film at 120 °C for 30 min. A small amount of the intermediate phase containing MACl and PACl and the solvent and δ phase disappeared after heat treatment, transforming into a nearly pure α-FAPbI 3
perovskite structure. This observation is also supported by the time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) results, which showed that almost no Cl −
ions remained in FAPbI 3
in all thin films (Supplementary Fig.
2 ). As reported for MACl addition 7 , 14 , 16 , few residual Cl −
ions were found in PACl and BACl, indicating that almost all of the added RACl evaporated during the coating and annealing processes. The reason for the ready disappearance of RACls added to the precursor solution, such as MACl and PACl, whereas only FAPbI 3
remains, will be discussed later. In thin films obtained from precursors containing PACl, a preferred orientation along the (100) α
direction and crystallinity increased as PACl increased up to 15 mol%, with a slight difference between 10 mol% and 15 mol%. This result indicated that PACl led to sharp Bragg diffraction spots of the (100) α
plane along the Debye–Scherrer ring at
q  ≈ 10 nm −1 , indicating improved crystallinity and grain orientation in the out-of-plane direction perpendicular to the substrate. The influence of these crystallinities, crystal orientation and surface morphology controls on the device performance was investigated according to the amount of PACl added to the precursor solution. As shown in Supplementary Fig.
3 , the average efficiency was the highest in the devices fabricated with a precursor solution wherein 10 mol% PACl was added to 35 mol% MACl. The efficiency improvement with PACl indicates that the effect of PA +
cations, rather than that of Cl −
ions, is dominant because the PSCs fabricated with the precursor to which more MACl was added resulted in lower performance. This implies that more controlled crystallization occurs in the perovskite thin film, in which 10 mol% of PACl is added to the precursor.

To gain further insight into the PA +
cations for the δ-phase to α-phase transition at low temperatures and highly flat surface morphology of the FAPbI 3
perovskite thin films, we first monitored the surface and structural evolution of the as-deposited thin films at RT. Their behaviours were compared with those of thin films coated with precursors to which 10 mol% MACl and BACl were added because the highest efficiency was obtained when 10 mol% PACl was added to a FAPbI 3
precursor solution containing 35 mol% MACl. Figure
2a
shows azimuthally integrated in situ 2D GI-WAXD measured during ageing of as-deposited film at RT for 0–120 min. Hereafter, 35 mol% of MACl in the FAPbI 3
precursor solution is referred to as ‘control’, further addition of 10 mol% of MACl and BACl as ‘reference 1’ and ‘reference 2’, respectively, and further addition of 10 mol% of PACl as ‘target’. In the film coated with the control, the δ phase was almost 100% and the α phase appeared after several tens of minutes and increased substantially during ageing for 120 min. However, even after 120 min, the δ phase was dominant. The as-deposited thin film coated with reference 1 exhibited a greater δ-phase to α-phase transition tendency but the δ phase remained after ageing for 120 min. By contrast, the thin film coated using the target and reference 2 rapidly underwent a δ-phase to α-phase transition with the generation of some amount of 2D phase as the ageing time increased and almost attained the α-phase after 120 min. Because the in situ-generated 2D perovskites disappeared during annealing (Fig.
1c ), both PA +
and BA +
cations, like MA +
cations, presumably escaped from the thin film. The time-dependent change in the α and δ phases shown in the GI-WAXD of Fig.
2a
is quantitatively illustrated in Fig.
2b,c . The integral of the δ phase for each ageing time initially increased and then rapidly decreased, with the change being more pronounced over time (Fig.
2b ). Concurrently, the α phase rapidly increased from the beginning and was saturated from 30 min to 1 h. In the coating film of the precursor to which BACl was added, the δ phase sharply decreased, whereas the α phase rapidly increased from the beginning of ageing (Fig.
2c ); thus, the two changes were well matched. On this addition of BACl, the faster δ-phase to α-phase transition is believed to be associated with a slower volatilization rate of deprotonated BA 0
and stronger base–acid interaction with PbI 2
of FAPbI 3 , because the temperature of such a phase transition is also the lowest in BACl (Extended Data Fig.
3 ). However, such a δ-phase to α-phase transition at RT did not occur unless an antisolvent was dropped during the spin-coating process of the precursor solution on the substrate, and the phase transition occurred only when the temperature was raised (Extended Data Fig.
4 ). As shown by comparing the GI-WAXD (Fig.
1c ) for the target thin film as deposited with and without dripping the antisolvent, a marked difference was observed in terms of crystallinity and orientation and unknown intermediates. Furthermore, in situ GI-WAXD measurements during annealing to 120 °C with the previous two coating films demonstrated that the α phase in the thin film coated without dripping the antisolvent appeared at a relatively high temperature, greater than 70 °C (Extended Data Fig.
4 ). The differences could be related to the washout of almost all dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) bound to FAPbI 3
when the antisolvent was dropped during spin coating using RACl-added precursors. This observation can be attributed to the fact that, in RACl and DMSO, which compete with PbI 2
as the Lewis base, DMSO is soluble in the antisolvent, whereas RACl remains insoluble; thus, the RACl may dominate the crystallization of the perovskite. Particularly, unlike the intermediate of FAPbI 3 -DMSO, RACl coordinated to FAPbI 3
is considered present on the surface of crystalline FAPbI 3
precipitated by the dripping of an antisolvent. On this basis, the behaviour seen in Fig.
2a
can be explained by the presence of RACl on the surface of the δ-phase crystal, which reduces the surface energy, converting to the corner-shared structure from the edge-shared phase by rotating the PbI 6
octahedron 20 , 21 , 24 , and can further orient the crystal in the (100) α
direction by orientation attachment 25 , 26 . Numerous studies have reported that several substances, such as Cl −
and SCN −
bound to the surface of δ-FAPbI 3 , lower the transition barrier, thereby facilitating the transition to the α phase at low temperatures 20 , 23 , 27 . DMSO also facilitates the δ-phase to α-phase transition when adsorbed on the surface of the δ-FAPbI 3
crystals 28 , 29 . In this context, the in situ GI-WAXD measurements demonstrate that δ-FAPbI 3
transforms to α-FAPbI 3
at 60–80 °C during slow heating. Thus, we conclude that the phase transition is generally thermodynamically favourable above 60 °C because of the lowering of the activation barrier in the presence of RACl. At RT, the barrier kinetically suppresses the return to the δ phase 20 . The visual colour change also confirms the δ-phase to α-phase transition with ageing of the as-deposited thin film. In the digital photograph of the change with time of the same thin film as shown in Fig.
2a , the black areas are darkened owing to the formation of α-FAPbI 3
according to the type of RACl (Extended Data Fig.
5 ). Notably, the thin film coated without the antisolvent did not turn black, regardless of RACl type (Supplementary Fig.
4 ). The δ-phase to α-phase transition, occurring thermodynamically at a high temperature of 150 °C or even at RT, is attributed to the complex action of the metastable intermediate depending on the amount of Cl −
ions and the type of RA +
with the removal of the residual solvents. There have been many reports on the δ-phase to α-phase transition and preferred orientation at low temperatures when adding Cl −
anions, such as HCl and MACl (refs.  3 , 23 , 30 , 31 ). Furthermore, the 2D phases resulting from RA +
lower the δ-phase to α-phase transition temperature and enhance the α-phase stability 32 . RACl added to the FAPbI 3
precursor solution substantially lowered the transition temperature, which even disappeared during ageing at RT (Supplementary Fig.
5 ). This result indicates that the δ-phase to α-phase transition of the coated thin film is kinetically affected by the amount of RACl and the type of RA + . The transformation of α-FAPbI 3
perovskite from the crystalline precursor film was also investigated in the formation chemistry by measuring the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) on the Pb L III
edge 33 . Consistent with the behaviour in GI-WAXD (Fig.
2a ), the interatomic distance between Pb–I and its peak intensity, indicating the δ-phase to α-phase transition (Extended Data Fig.
6 ), was changed (Fig.
2d ). Furthermore, the number of I −
and Cl −
ions coordinating with Pb 2+
cations increased in response to this phase transition and then began decreasing (Fig.
2e ). This result implies that the coordination of RACl to PbI 2
initially increases, leading to the formation of PbI 6
octahedrons, and then slowly disappears. RA +
(soft acid) acts more like a soft base (I − ) to form stable products, whereas RA +
(soft acid) and Cl −
(hard base) form unstable products. Furthermore, the primary ammonium (RA + ) ions, although their p K a
slightly depends on the length of the alkyl group, are weakly acidic and deprotonate more readily than FA +
(ref.  34 ). Thus, the RACl coordinated to PbI 2
(or FAPbI 3 ) was expected to be converted to highly volatile species (for example, MA 0 , PA 0
and HCl) through processes such as deprotonation of RA +
(refs.  11 , 12 , 34 ) while binding with PbI 2
as RA +
cations and Cl −
anions (RA ⋯ H + -Cl −  − PbI 2  + FA +  → RA 0 ↑ + HPbI 2 Cl + FA +  → HCl↑ + FAPbI 3 ). Indeed, RACl itself decomposes and evaporates only above 180 °C (ref.  35 ). The RA 0
generated by RA +
deprotonation may exist in a liquid phase before volatilization during annealing, depending on its boiling point. Considering this, we surmise that liquid RA 0
can influence the surface flattening of FAPbI 3 , depending on the RA 0
type. As expected, the BACl-added precursor resulted in a better surface morphology flatness than that obtained using MACl (Extended Data Fig.
1b ); however, the thin film coated with PACl-added precursor was the flattest. Fig. 2: Structural evolution by in situ GI-WAXD of thin films coated with volatile RACl. a , The structural evolution of the as-deposited thin films, which were coated using the FAPbI 3

thin films Figure
3a
shows the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of perovskite layers annealed at 120 °C for 40 min after spin-coating the precursor solutions with different types and amounts of volatile RACl on a glass substrate. The control, reference 1 and reference 2 have similar PL intensities but that of the target is slightly high and implies decreasing nonradioactive recombination. For a more quantitative comparison of charge recombination, time-resolved PL was measured using time-correlated single-photon counting under low-intensity pulsed excitation, in which a mono-exponential decay through nonradiative-trap-induced recombination can be observed 36 . The corresponding mono-exponential lifetimes (Supplementary Table
1 ) were obtained from the PL decay curves in Fig.
3b . The carrier lifetime of the target film ( τ  = 2,929 ns) was longer than that of the control, reference 1 and reference 2 films ( τ  = 2,187, 2,582 and 1,503 ns, respectively). The highest PL intensity and the longest lifetime in the target film indicated that the nonradiative recombination was the lowest, suggesting the formation of a thin film with the lowest defect concentration by adding 10 mol% PACl. We further measured the dark current–voltage of the full devices by means of the space-charge-limited current method 37 , 38
(Fig.
3c
and Extended Data Fig.
7 ). From the calculated trap densities (Supplementary Table
2 ), the trap densities are calculated to be 1.13 × 10 16 , 1.05 × 10 16 , 1.18 × 10 16
and 9.37 × 10 15   cm −3  for the control, reference 1, reference 2 and target films, respectively. Obviously, the target showed the lowest trap concentration, indicating that the defects in the perovskite film coated with the 10-mol%-PACl-added precursor were reduced. Although target and reference 2 are almost similar in terms of surface morphology and the δ-phase to α-phase transition of the perovskite thin film, the lowest trap density in target is believed to be because of higher crystallinity than reference 2. This may be related to the relatively too fast rate of crystallization in the formation of the perovskite thin film of reference 2 (Extended Data Fig.
8 ). Urbach energies ( E u ) were also compared because the low defect concentration of the perovskite thin film responsible for the high performance was because of the superiority of the structural quality during the crystal formation of perovskites.
E u
for the perovskite films was calculated from the ultraviolet (UV)–visible absorption spectra using the following equation:
α  =  α 0 exp( hν / E u ), in which
α
is the absorption coefficient and
hν
is the photon energy.
E u
in the target represented the lowest value, indicating the highest structural quality (Fig.
3d
and Supplementary Fig.
6 ). Fig. 3: Characteristics of perovskite layers deposited with volatile RACl. a , b , Steady-state PL ( a ) and time-resolved PL ( b ) spectra of films deposited on a glass substrate.

Full size image Photovoltaic performance The consistent results that the target thin film is of high quality encourage further investigation into the benefits of thin films in photovoltaic devices. Thus, 24 PSCs under identical conditions using different RACls were fabricated to confirm their impact on performance in each category. The statistical distribution of current density ( J SC ), open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) and fill factor (FF) determining the power-conversion efficiency (PCE) are shown in Fig.
4a . As expected from the defect concentration and carrier lifetime analysis of the perovskite thin films formed under each condition, the average PCE of target was the highest and increased compared with that of reference 2. By contrast, the average PCE of reference 1 was lower than that of control. Excessive addition of MACl may be related to the incorporation of small amounts of MA +
ions into FAPbI 3
(ref.  7 ), which affects the bandgap (Supplementary Fig.
7 ) and external strain 39 , further affecting the reduction of
J SC
and FF and, eventually, PCE. The
J – V
characteristics of the best-performing target device in reverse and forward bias sweeps with antireflective coatings on the device surface are illustrated in Fig.
4b . The
J SC ,
V OC
and FF values calculated from the
J – V
curve at a reverse scan mode were 25.69 mA cm −2 , 1.178 V and 86.15%, respectively; these factors correspond to the PCE of 26.08% under standard air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5 G) conditions, with
J SC ,
V OC , FF and PCE values of 25.64 mA cm −2 , 1.178 V, 85.06% and 25.7%, respectively, at the forward bias. The PCE of the device was further verified by an accredited laboratory (Newport, USA) using the quasi-steady-state method (Supplementary Fig.
8 ). The resulting stabilized efficiency measured was 25.73%, with
J SC ,
V OC
and FF values of 25.80 mA cm −2 , 1.179 V and 84.60%, respectively, which is the highest efficiency ever reported. Figure
4c
shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) for the same device as that of the
J – V
curve. The
J SC
obtained by integrating the EQE over the wavelength is 25.3 mA cm −2 , which is in good agreement with that in the
J – V
curve measured using the solar simulator. When tested with maximum power point tracking under ambient and full sunlight illumination without a UV cutoff filter, the encapsulated target device retained approximately 88% (25.2%) of its initial efficiency after 600 h (Fig.
4d ).

Full size image Methods Materials The following materials were used in the experiments: formamidinium iodide (FAI; 99.99%, GreatCell Solar), lead(II) iodide (PbI 2 ; 99.99%, TCI), methylenediamine dihydrochloride (MDACl 2 ; 98%, Sigma-Aldrich), methylammonium chloride (MACl; Merck), propylamine hydrochloride (PACl; 99%, Sigma-Aldrich), butylamine hydrochloride (BACl; 98%, TCI), 4-methoxy-phenethylammonium iodide (MeO-PEAI; 99%, GreatCell Solar), tin(II) chloride dihydrate (SnCl 2 ·2H 2 O; 98%, Acros), Urea (Alfa Aesar), deionized water (H 2 O; Alfa Aesar), potassium chloride (KCl; 99.999%, Sigma-Aldrich), hydrochloric acid (HCl; 37 wt% in H 2 O, Sigma-Aldrich), thioglycolic acid (C 2 H 4 O 2 S; 99%, Sigma-Aldrich), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF; anhydrous, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; anhydrous, 99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), 2-propanol (anhydrous, 99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich), 2-methoxyethanol (2-ME; anhydrous, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich), chlorobenzene (anhydrous, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich), acetonitrile (ACN; anhydrous, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich), Spiro-OMeTAD (Lumtec), 4- tert -butylpyridine (t-BP; 98%, Sigma-Aldrich), bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (Li-TFSI; 99.95%, Sigma-Aldrich), FK209 Co(III) TFSI salt (Lumtec) and ethyl ether (99.0%, SAMCHUN). Formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI 3 ) black powder was synthesized by mixing 3.36 g FAI with 9 g PbI 2
(1:1 molar ratio) in 11 ml of 2-ME in a 70-ml vial by stirring. The mixed solution was heated to 120 °C in an oil bath and stirred for 45 min. Subsequently, the precipitated FAPbI 3
was filtered using filter paper (Whatman) without cooling to RT. The filtered FAPbI 3
was baked on a hot plate at 150 °C (in air) for 30 min and then left overnight in a vacuum chamber at RT. Device fabrication PSCs were composed of several layers of glass/fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/SnO 2 /perovskite/2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[ N,N -di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD)/Au. FTO glass (Asahi VU glass, 12–13 Ω cm −2 ) substrates were sequentially sonicated in acetone, detergent and ethanol for 20 min each. The FTO glasses were dipped in a solution prepared by mixing SnCl 2 ·2H 2 O (108 mg), urea (500 mg), thioglycolic acid (10 μl) and HCl (500 μl) in 40 ml of deionized water for 6 h. The substrates were then annealed at 150 °C for 1 h, followed by spin-coating with KCl solution (40 mM) in deionized water and annealing at 150 °C for 15 min. The perovskite precursor solutions were prepared by dissolving 1.4 M FAPbI 3
powder with MDACl 2
(3.8 mol%) and MACl (35 mol%) in a mixed solvent of DMF:DMSO = 8:1 (control); 10 mol% of different alkylammonium chlorides were added for the reference 1 (MACl 10 mol%), reference 2 (BACl 10 mol%) and target (PACl 10 mol%) solutions. The perovskite solutions were then spin-coated onto the substrate at 1,000 rpm for 10 s and 5,000 rpm for 15 s; 1 ml of ethyl ether was dripped onto the substrate during spinning. Before all perovskite layers were heat-treated at 120 °C for 1 h, the as-deposited layers were aged for a period of time at RT, depending on the added RACl. Characterization The surface morphology of the perovskite layers was observed by SEM (Cold FE-SEM SU-8220, Hitachi High-Technologies) with a beam power of 5.0 kV. Steady-state PL and time-resolved PL spectra were measured using a commercial time-correlated single-photon-counting setup (FluoTime 300, PicoQuant GmbH) equipped with a PMA-C-192-M detector and high-resolution excitation monochromators. The
J – V
characteristics of the devices were measured using a Keithley 2420 source meter under illumination by a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Sol3A class AAA) with an AM 1.5 G filter and 100 mW cm −2
irradiation intensity. The active area was determined by placing a metal mask in front of the solar cell to avoid the overestimation of the photocurrent density. A spectral mismatch factor of 1.05 was used for all
J – V
measurements. For the measurement of high-efficiency devices, an antireflective film (NanoEcoWay Co., Ltd.) was applied to the surface. The EQE was measured using an internal quantum efficiency system (Oriel, IQE 200B) under irradiation by a 100-W xenon lamp. The film morphology and thickness were measured using SEM (FE-SEM, Su-7000). GI-WAXD measurements GI-WAXD measurements were performed at the PLS-II 6D UNIST-PAL beamline at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL), Korea. The X-rays from the bending magnet were monochromatized to 18.986 keV ( λ  = 0.6530 Å) using a double-crystal monochromator focused horizontally and vertically (90 (V) × 120 (H) μm 2
full width at half maximum) at the sample position using a sagittal Si(111) crystal and toroidal mirror, respectively. The GI-WAXD sample chamber was equipped with a five-axis motorized stage for fine sample alignment. The 2D GI-WAXD pattern was recorded using a 2D charge-coupled device detector (MX225-HS, Rayonix, LLC, USA). The diffraction angles were calibrated using NIST SRM660b (LaB 6 ) with a sample-to-detector distance of 240.98 mm. An incidence angle of 0.80° was used for the in situ GI-WAXD experiments to obtain crystallographic information about the overall thickness of the perovskite films and to ensure that all incoming X-rays were irradiated onto the small-length perovskite film sample, rather than only passing or being blocked by the substrate or sample stage. The in situ GI-WAXD pattern was obtained every 5 s for the initial 1.5 min and every 1 min between 1.5 and 30 min, in which the X-ray exposure time was 3.5 s each. The FAPbI 3
film temperature was increased from RT to 120 °C in 1.5 min and maintained at 120 °C for 30 min using a fine-tuned temperature controller (Eurotherm 3504 temperature controller, Eurotherm, USA). EXAFS measurements The specimen for EXAFS analysis was prepared by coating FAPbI 3
precursor solution containing MACl 35 mol% and PACl 10 mol%. The as-deposited layer was subjected to EXAFS for a total of six times, 2 min every 20 min. (The total X-ray exposure time was 12 min.) Pb L III -edge X-ray absorption spectra, EXAFS, were collected on the BL10C beam line (WEXAFS) at the Pohang Light Source (PLS-II) using top-up mode operation under a ring current of 350 mA at 3.0 GeV. From the high-intensity X-ray photons of the multipole wiggler source, monochromatic X-ray beams could be obtained using a liquid-nitrogen-cooled double-crystal monochromator (Bruker ASC) with a Si(111) crystal pair. Under grazing incident angle of 3°, all X-ray absorption spectra were recorded in fluorescence mode using a N 2 /Ar mixed-gas-filled ionization chamber (IC Spec, FMB Oxford) and passivated implanted planar silicon (PIPS, Canberra Co.) for the incident and fluorescent X-ray photons, respectively. Higher-order harmonic contaminations were eliminated by detuning to reduce the incident X-ray intensity by about 30%. Energy calibration was simultaneously performed for each measurement with a reference Pb foil in front of the third ion chamber using partially bypassed X-rays. Using the UWXAFS package, Fourier-transformed radial distribution functions (RDFs) of
k 3 -weighted Pb L III -edge EXAFS spectra,
k 3 χ ( k ) were obtained in the
k
range between 3.0 and 13.0 Å −1
through a standard XAFS data-analysis process. Ideal RDFs for model δ-phase and α-phase FAPbI 3
could be obtained from ab initio calculation using FEFF9 code. ToF-SIMS measurements ToF-SIMS profiling measured the depth distributions of the Cl −
ions with perovskite/SnO 2
on the FTO substrate. The samples were analysed using a ToF-SIMS V instrument (IONTOF) with a Bi +
primary beam (25 keV and 1 pA) and Cs +
sputter beam (0.25 keV and 12 nA). The sputter size was 200 × 200 μm; the analysis areas were 100 μm × 100 μm (for depth profiling) and 500 μm × 500 μm (for surface analysis); the area dosage of ions was PIDD 2.48e +
(ref.  14 ). Device stability testing The stability test at the continuous maximum power point tracking device operation under 1 sun illumination at AM 1.5 G (xenon lamp, 450 W) for the encapsulated devices was performed under an inert atmosphere (N 2 ) by fixing the voltage at
V MPP
and then tracking the current output. Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the  Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary

Abstract Defects passivation is widely devoted to improving the performance of formamidinium lead triiodide perovskite solar cells; however, the effect of various defects on the α-phase stability is still unclear. Here, using density functional theory, we first reveal the degradation pathway of the formamidinium lead triiodide perovskite from α to δ phase and investigate the effect of various defects on the energy barrier of phase transition. The simulation results predict that iodine vacancies are most likely to trigger the degradation, since they obviously reduce the energy barrier of α-to-δ phase transition and have the lowest formation energies at the perovskite surface. A water-insoluble lead oxalate compact layer is introduced on the perovskite surface to largely suppress the α-phase collapse through hindering the iodine migration and volatilization. Furthermore, this strategy largely reduces the interfacial nonradiative recombination and boosts the efficiency of the solar cells to 25.39% (certified 24.92%). Unpackaged device can maintain 92% of its initial efficiency after operation at maximum power point under simulated air mass 1.5 G irradiation for 550 h.

Introduction The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has reached a certified record value of 26% 1 . Since 2015, the state-of-the-art PSCs prefer to adopt formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI 3 ) perovskite as light absorption layer since it possesses the excellent thermal-stability and has a preferred bandgap closer to the Shockley-Queisser limit 2 , 3 , 4 . Unfortunately, the FAPbI 3
films thermodynamically undergo a phase transition from the black α-phase to a yellow non-perovskite δ-phase at room temperature 5 , 6 . Various complex perovskite compositions have been developed to prevent the formation of the δ-phase. The most common strategies to overcome this problem is mixing FAPbI 3
with a combination of methylammonium (MA + ), cesium (Cs + ) and bromide (Br - ) ions 7 , 8 , 9 . Nevertheless, mixed perovskites suffer an enlarged bandgap and light-induced phase segregation which will compromise the performance and operational stability of the resulting PSCs 10 , 11 , 12 . Recently, it is demonstrated that the pure FAPbI 3
single crystal without any alloying can own excellent stability due to its excellent crystallinity and low defects 13 , 14 . Thus, defects reduction through improving the crystallinity of bulk FAPbI 3
is an essential strategy for achieving efficient and stable PSCs 2 , 15 . However, degradation to undesirable yellow hexagonal non-perovskite δ-phase during the operation of FAPbI 3
PSCs can still occur 16 . This process is generally initialized from the surfaces and grain boundaries, which is more vulnerable under water, heat and light due to the exist of numerous defect sites 17 . Consequently, surface/grain boundary passivation is required to stabilize the black-phase FAPbI 3 18 . Many strategies of defects passivation, including introducing low dimensional perovskite, Lewis acid/base molecules and ammonium halide salts etc., have achieved great progress for the formamidinium PSCs 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 . To date, almost all studies focus on the role of various defects in determining the optoelectronic properties, such as carrier recombination, diffusion lengths and energy band structure in solar cells 22 , 23 , 24 . Such as using density functional theory (DFT), the formation energies and trap level of various defects are theoretically predicted, which has been widely used to guide the practical passivation design 20 , 25 , 26 . The device stability generally seems to improve as the defects decrease. However, the impact mechanism of various defects on the phase-stabilities and optoelectronic properties should be completely different in formamidinium PSCs. To our knowledge, a fundamental understanding of how the defects induce the cubic-to-hexagonal (α-to-δ) phase transition and the role of surface passivation on phase stability of α-FAPbI 3
perovskite are still not well-known. Herein, by using DFT, we revealed the degradation pathway of the FAPbI 3
perovskite from black α-phase to yellow δ-phase and the effect of various defects on the energy barrier of α-to-δ phase transition. It is predicted that the I vacancies, which easily generated during the film preparation process and device operation, are most likely to trigger the α-to-δ phase transition. Thereby, we introduced a water-insoluble and chemically stable lead oxalate (PbC 2 O 4 ) compact layer on the top of FAPbI 3
through in-situ reaction. The lead oxalate surface (LOS) suppressed the formation of I vacancies and retarded the migration of I ion under stimuli of heat, light and electric field. As a result, the LOS largely reduced the interfacial nonradiative recombination and boosted the efficiency of FAPbI 3
PSCs to 25.39% (certified 24.92%). Unpackaged LOS devices maintained 92% of their initial efficiency after operation at maximum power point (MPP) under simulated air mass (AM) 1.5 G irradiation for over 550 h. Results First-principles calculations studies First, we performed first-principles calculations to find the degradation pathway of FAPbI 3
perovskite transition from α to δ-phase. From the detailed phase transition process, it is found that the transition of a 3D corner sharing [PbI 6 ] octahedron in cubic α-phase FAPbI 3
to a face-sharing 1D line [PbI 6 ] octahedron in hexagonal δ-phase FAPbI 3
is enabled by breaking 9 Pb–I bonds in the first step (Int-1) with energy barrier as high as 0.62 eV/cell, as shown in Fig.  1a . By the octahedrons shear along [0 \(\bar{1}\) 1] direction, the hexagonal short chains extend from 1 × 1 to 1 × 3, 1 × 4, and eventually transit to δ-phase. The orientation relation of the whole pathway is (011) α //(001) δ  + [100] α //[100] δ . While from the energy profile, we can find that after the δ-phase FAPbI 3
nucleation, the energy barrier become lower relative the α-phase in the following steps, meaning the phase transition will speed up. Obviously, if we want to inhibit the α-phase degradation, the manipulation of the first step of phase transition is critical. Fig. 1: First-principles calculations studies. a

(gray, lead; purple (orange), iodine (mobile iodine); brown, carbon; light blue, nitrogen; red, oxygen; light pink, hydrogen). Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Full size image Then, we systematically investigated the effect of various native point defects (including anti‑site occupations of Pb FA , I FA , Pb I , and I Pb ; interstitials of Pb i , and I i ; vacancies of V I , V FA , and V Pb ), which were regarded as the key factor to trigger the phase degradation at atomic and energy level, as shown in Fig.  1b
and Supplementary Table  1 . Interestingly, not all the defects will reduce the energy barrier of α-to-δ phase transition (Fig.  1b ). We believe that the defects which both have low formation energy and reduce the energy barrier of α-to-δ phase transition are considered to be harmful to the phase stability. As previous reports, Pb-rich surface is typically considered in efficient formamidinium PSCs 27 . Thus, we focused on the (100) surface with PbI 2
termination in a Pb-rich condition. The defect formation energies of native point defects on the surface are shown in Fig.  1c
and Supplementary Table  1 . Considering the energy barrier (EB) of phase transition and formation energy (FE), these defects were divided into three types. Type-I (Low EB-High FE): Although I Pb , V FA
and V Pb
largely reduce the energy barrier of phase transition, they have high formation energies. Thus, we thought these types of defects have limited effect on the phase transition since they rarely formed. Type-II (High EB): The Pb I , I FA
and Pb FA
antisite defects will not be detrimental to the phase stability of α-FAPbI 3
perovskite due to the improved energy barrier of α-to-δ phase transition. Type-III (Low EB-Low FE): V I,
I i
and Pb i
defects with relatively low formation energies will induce the degradation of the black phase. Particularly lowest FE and EB of V I
taken into consideration, we think that the most effective strategy is reducing the I vacancies. In order to reduce the V I , we designed a PbC 2 O 4
compact layer to reinforce the FAPbI 3
surface. In comparation with the organic halide salt passivator, such as phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) and n-Octylammonium Iodide (OAI), etc., PbC 2 O 4
without mobile halogen ions is chemically stable and insoluble in water that can stabilize the perovskite surface well under the stimuli of moisture and electric field. The solubility of PbC 2 O 4
in water is merely 0.00065 g liter −1 , which is even lower than that of PbSO 4 28 . More importantly, the compact and uniform LOS layer can be mildly prepared on the perovskite film through in-situ reaction (see below). We performed DFT simulation for the interface binding between FAPbI 3
and PbC 2 O 4 , as shown in Supplementary Fig.  1 . The defect formation energies after introducing the LOS were given in Supplementary Table  2 . We found that the LOS not only increases the V I
defect formation energy from 0.69 eV to 1.53 eV (Fig.  1d ), but also improves the activation energies for I migration on the surface and migration escaping the surface (Fig.  1e ). For the first step, the I ion migrate on the perovskite surface leaving V I
in the lattice site with an energy barrier of 0.61 eV; while the activation energy for I ionic migration increase to 1.28 eV after introducing LOS due to the steric-hindrance effect. For the I ionic migration escaping the perovskite surface, the energy barrier in LOS is also higher than that in control sample (Fig.  1e ). The schematic views of I ionic migration path in the control and LOS FAPbI 3
are shown in Fig.  1f, g , respectively. The simulation results illustrate that the LOS can suppress the V I
defects formation and I volatilization, which will in turn hinder the α-to-δ phase transition nucleation. Characterization of lead oxalate on the perovskite surface The reaction between the oxalic acid and FAPbI 3
perovskite was tested. After mixing oxalic acid and FAPbI 3
solution, a large amount of white-colored sediment was yielded, as shown in Supplementary Fig.  2 . The powder products were identified as pure PbC 2 O 4
materials through X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Supplementary Fig.  3 ) and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) (Supplementary Fig.  4 ). We found that oxalic acid can be dissolved in isopropanol (IPA) well at room temperature with a solubility of approximately 18 mg mL −1 , as shown in Supplementary Fig.  5 . It is beneficial to the post-treatment, since the IPA as a general passivation solvent is not destructive to the perovskite layer in short time 29 . Thus, a thin and compact PbC 2 O 4
can be rapidly generated on the surface of the perovskite films through immersing the perovskite film into the oxalic acid solution or spin-coating the oxalic acid solution on perovskite, according to the following chemical equations: H 2 C 2 O 4  + FAPbI 3  = PbC 2 O 4  + FAI + HI. The FAI can be dissolved in the IPA and thus removed during the preparation process. The thickness of the LOS can be controlled by the reaction time and precursor concentration. The scanning electron microscopies (SEM) of control and LOS perovskite films are shown in Fig.  2a, b . The results show that the perovskite surface morphology maintained well and a mass of small particles deposited on the surface of crystalline grain, which should be the PbC 2 O 4
layer generated through in-situ reaction. The LOS perovskite films have a slight smoother surface (Supplementary Fig.  6 ) and a larger water contact angle than the control films (Supplementary Fig.  7 ). Cross-sectional high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) was used to distinguish the surface product layers. As compared to the control film (Fig.  2c ), a uniform and compact thin layer with a thickness of around 10 nm on the top of LOS perovskite could be clearly discerned (Fig.  2d ). The high‐angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) was used to probe the interface between PbC 2 O 4
and FAPbI 3
and it can be clearly observed that there is a crystalline FAPbI 3
region and an amorphous PbC 2 O 4
region (Supplementary Fig.  8 ). X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out to characterize the perovskite surface composition after oxalic acid treatment, as shown in Fig.  2e–g . In Fig.  2e , the C 1 s
peaks around 284.8 eV and 288.5 eV belonged to the specific signals of C–C and FA, respectively. Compared with the control film, an additional peak at 289.2 eV attributed to the C 2 O 4 2−
was observed in the LOS film. In the O 1 s
spectra, the LOS perovskite exhibits three chemically distinct O 1 s
peaks at 531.7 eV, 532.5 eV, and 533.4 eV corresponding to the O atoms of deprotonated COO, C=O and OH components of the intact oxalate group 30
(Fig.  2f ). For the control sample, only a slight O 1 s
peak is observed which can be attributed to the chemisorbed oxygen on the surface. The characteristic Pb 4 f 7/2
and Pb 4 f 5/2
were located at 138.4 eV and 143.3 eV for the control film, respectively. We observed that the LOS perovskite shows a ~0.15 eV shift of the Pb peaks toward larger binding energies, which indicates the stronger interaction between C 2 O 4 2-
and Pb atom (Fig.  2g ). Fig. 2: Morphology and XPS spectra of control and LOS perovskite films. Top-view SEM images of

Based on DFT results, V I
defects and I migration are theoretically predicted to be liable to induce the α-to-δ phase transition. Previous reports have demonstrated that a fast release of I 2
from the FA-based perovskite films during light soaking, after exposing films under the stress of light and heat 31 , 32 , 33 . To confirm the lead oxalate stabilizing effect on the α-phase perovskite, we immersed the control and LOS perovskite films into transparent glass bottle filled with toluene, respectively, and then illuminated them under 1-sun illumination for 24 h. The ultraviolet-visible (UV–Vis) absorption of the toluene solution was measured, as shown in Fig.  3a . It is observed a much lower I 2
absorption intensity in the LOS perovskite case in comparison with the control sample, illustrating that the compact LOS could suppress the release of I 2
from the perovskite films during light soaking. The photograph of the aged control and LOS perovskite films is shown in the inset of Fig.  3b and c . The LOS perovskite still maintained black while most region of the control film has already turned yellow. The UV–Vis absorption spectra of the immersed films were presented in Fig.  3b, c . We observed that the absorption corresponding to the α-phase in control film showed an obvious decrease. The XRD measurement was carried out to record the crystal structure evolution. A strong yellow δ-phase signal (11.8°) was observed in the control perovskite after 24 h illumination while the LOS perovskite still maintained the black-phase well (Fig.  3d ).

Full size image We performed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements to observe the microstructure changes of perovskite films after 24 h illumination, as shown in Fig.  3e, f . For the control film, the large crystal grains were damaged and converted to small needles which are consistent to the morphology of δ-phase FAPbI 3
product 17
(Fig.  3e ). For the LOS film, the perovskite crystal grains maintained well (Fig.  3f ). The results confirmed that the loss of I obviously induced the transition from black to yellow phase while the PbC 2 O 4
stabilized the black phase through impeding the I loss. Owing to the much higher vacancy density at the surface than in the bulk of the grains 34 , this phase transition is more likely to happen at the surface of the grains along with the release of iodine and the generation of V I . As the DFT predicted, the LOS could suppress the formation of V I
defects and block the I ions migration at the perovskite surface. In addition, we studied the effect of PbC 2 O 4
layers on the moisture resistance of perovskite films in ambient air (30–60% relative humidity). As presented in Supplementary Fig.  9 , the LOS perovskite still remained black after 12 days, while the control film has already turned yellow. In XRD measurements, the control film exhibited strong peak at 11.8° corresponding to δ-phase FAPbI 3
while the LOS perovskite maintained black α-phase well (Supplementary Fig.  10 ). Carrier extraction and photovoltaic performance The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) were performed to investigate the passivation effect of lead oxalate on the perovskite surface. Figure  4a
shows the LOS film has an enhanced PL intensity. In the PL mapping images, the intensity of LOS film in the whole 10 × 10 µm 2
region was higher than that of control film (Supplementary Fig.
11 ), clarifying that the PbC 2 O 4
uniformly passivates the perovskite film. The carrier lifetimes are determined through fitting the TRPL decays to a mono-exponential function (Fig.  4b ). The LOS film shows a carrier lifetime of 5.2 μs which is much longer than the control film with a carrier lifetime of 0.9 μs, demonstrating the reduced nonradiative recombination at the surface.

Full size image To study the effect of lead oxalate layer on the device performance, a conventional n-i-p structure of FTO/TiO 2 /SnO 2 /perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au was adopted. We used formamidinium chloride (FACl) as the additive instead of methylamine hydrochloride (MACl) in the perovskite precursor to achieve better device performance since FACl can result into better crystalline quality and avoid broadening the bandgap of FAPbI 3 35
(detailed comparisons are shown in Supplementary Figs.  12 – 14 ). The IPA was selected as an antisolvent since it resulted in better crystal quality and higher preferred orientation in perovskite films in comparation with the diethyl ether (DE) or chlorobenzene (CB) 36
(Supplementary Figs.  15
and
16 ). The thickness of PbC 2 O 4
was carefully optimized through regulating the oxalic acid concentrations to well balance the defect passivation and charge transport (Supplementary Fig.
17 ). The cross-sectional SEM images of the post-optimized control and LOS devices are shown in Supplementary Fig.
18 . The typical current density-voltage ( J - V ) curves of the control and LOS devices are shown in Fig.  4c , with the extracted parameters given in Supplementary Table  3 . The control cell had a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.43% (22.94%) with a
J sc
of 25.75 mA cm −2
(25.74 mA cm −2 ), a
V oc
of 1.16 V (1.16 V) and a fill factor (FF) of 78.40% (76.69%) from reverse (forward) scan. The LOS PSC had a maximum PCE of 25.39% (24.79%) with a
J sc
of 25.77 mA cm −2
(25.77 mA cm −2 ), a
V oc
of 1.18 V (1.18 V) and an FF of 83.50% (81.52%) from reverse (forward) scan. The LOS device achieved a certified photovoltaic performance of 24.92% at a credible third-party photovoltaic laboratory (Supplementary Fig.  19 ). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) yielded an integrated
J sc
of 24.90 mA cm −2
for the control and 25.18 mA cm −2
for the LOS PSCs, respectively, which matched well with the measured
J sc
under AM 1.5 G standard spectrum (Fig.  4d ). A statistical distribution of the measured PCE of the control and LOS PSCs are shown in Supplementary Fig.  20 . As shown in Fig.  4e , the relationship between
V oc
and light intensity was calculated to investigate the effect of PbC 2 O 4
on trap-assisted surface recombination. The slope of the fitting line for LOS device was 1.16
k B T / q , which was lower than that of control device (1.31
k B T / q ), confirming that LOS was beneficial to suppress the trap-assisted surface recombination. We employed the space charge limited current (SCLC) technique to quantitatively measure the defect densities of the perovskite films through measuring the dark
I – V
curves of hole-only devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au), as shown in Fig.  4f . The trap densities were calculated through employing the formula of
N t  = 2 ε 0 εV TFL / eL 2 , where
ε
is the relative dielectric constant of perovskite film,
ε 0
is the vacuum permittivity,
V TFL
is the trap filled limit voltage,
e
is the charge, and
L
is the thickness of the perovskite film (650 nm). The defect density of LOS device was calculated to be1.450 × 10 15  cm −3 , which was lower than that of the control device with 1.795 × 10 15  cm −3 . Stability of PSCs The unencapsulated devices were tested at the maximum power point (MPP) under full-sun illumination in a nitrogen atmosphere to explore its long-term operational stability (Fig.  5a ). The LOS device maintained 92% of its maximum efficiency after 550 h, while the control device degraded to 60% of its initial performance. The elemental distributions in the aged device were measured by time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) measurement (Fig.  5b, c ). Large accumulations of iodine can be seen for the control device along the top gold region. The inert gases protected condition ruled out environmental degradation factors, such as moisture and oxygen, indicating that intrinsic mechanisms (i.e., ion migration) were responsible. According to the ToF-SIMS results, I −
and AuI 2 −
ions were found in the Au electrode, indicating that I diffused from perovskite to Au. Both the signal intensities of I −
and AuI 2 −
ions in control device were approximately ten times higher than those of LOS sample. Previous report demonstrated that the ion penetration can lead to rapid degradation in hole conductivity of spiro-OMeTAD and chemical corrosion of the top electrode layer, which deteriorates the interface contact in the devices 37 ,
38 . We peeled the Au electrode and washed the spiro-OMeTAD layer from the substrates by chlorobenzene solution. Then, we performed grazing incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXRD) characterization on the films (Fig.  5d ). The results showed that an obvious diffraction peak located at 11.8° in the control film while there was no new peak in the LOS sample. It demonstrated that the massive loss of I ions from the control films induced the generation of δ-phase while this process was obviously suppressed in the LOS films.

(Supplementary Fig.  21 ). The activation energy ( E a ) for the ion migration was determined by measuring the conductivity ( σ ) changes of FAPbI 3
films at different temperatures ( T ) with the Nernst–Einstein relation:
σT
=
σ 0 exp(− E a / k B T ), where σ 0
is a constant,
k B
is the Boltzmann’s constant. We derived
E a
values from the slope of the ln(σT) versus 1/ T
of ~0.283 eV for the control and 0.419 eV for the LOS device. Discussion In summary, we give the theoretical framework for revealing the degradation pathway of the FAPbI 3
perovskite and the effect of various defects on the energy barrier of α-to-δ phase transition. Among these defects, V I
defects are theoretically predicted to be liable to induce the α-to-δ phase transition. The water-insoluble and chemically stable PbC 2 O 4
compact layer was introduced to stabilize the α-phase FAPbI 3
through suppressing the formation of I vacancies and migration of I ion. The strategy largely reduced the interfacial nonradiative recombination and boosted the efficiency of the solar cells to 25.39% with improved operation stability. Our results provide the guideline for achieving efficient and stable formamidinium PSCs through inhibiting the defect-induced α-to-δ phase transition. Methods Materials Titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TTIP, 99.999%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Hydrochloric acid (HCl, 35.0–37.0%) and ethanol (anhydrous) were purchased from Guangzhou Chemicals.

Oxalic acid (H 2 C 2 O 4 , 99.9%) was purchased from Macklin. All chemicals were used as received without any other refinement. Device fabrication The ITO or FTO substrates (1.5 × 1.5 cm 2 ) were cleaned ultrasonically with detergent, acetone, and ethanol for 10 min, respectively, then drying under nitrogen flow. A dense blocking layer of TiO 2
was deposited onto FTO substrate using titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) in ethanol (1/25, v/v) at 500 °C for 60 min. The SnO 2
colloidal dispersion was diluted with deionized water in a volume ratio of 1:5. The clean substrate that treated under UV-Ozone for 20 min was spin-coated with a thin layer of SnO 2
nanoparticle film at 4000 rpm for 30 s, then it was preheated at 150 °C for 30 min. For the perovskite precursor solution, 275.2 mg FAI, 737.6 mg PbI 2 , and FACl (20% mol) were dissolved in an DMF/DMSO (15/1) mixed solvent. The perovskite layer was fabricated by spin-coating 40 μL perovskite precursor solution on top of the UV-Ozone treated SnO 2
layer at a speed of 5000 rpm for 25 s in ambient air. At 5 s from the last, 50 μL MACl IPA solution (4 mg mL −1 ) as an antisolvent was rapidly dropped onto the substrate. Then the as fabricated film was annealed at 150 °C for 20 min, and followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. After the perovskite film was cooled down to room temperature, H 2 C 2 O 4
solution (1, 2, 4 mg in 1 mL IPA) was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s for passivating perovskite surface. The spiro-OMeTAD solution prepared by mixing 72.3 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 1 mL CB, 27 μL
t BP and 17.5 μL Li-TFSI (520 mg in 1 mL acetonitrile) was spin-coated on the films at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, 100 nm Au layer was evaporated under vacuum at rates of 0.05 nm s −1
(0~1 nm), 0.1 nm s −1
(2~15 nm) and 0.5 nm s −1
(16~100 nm). Device characterization The
J – V
characteristics of perovskite solar cells were measured using a Keithley 2400 meter under the illumination of the solar simulator (SS-X50) at a light intensity of 100 mW cm −2
as checked with a calibrated standard silicon solar cell. Unless otherwise stated, the
J – V
curves were all measured in a nitrogen-filled glovebox with forward and reverse scan modes (voltage steps of 20 mV and a delay time of 10 ms) at room temperature (~25 °C). A shadow mask was used to define an effective area of 0.067 cm 2
for the measured PSCs. EQE measurements were performed in ambient air using a PVE300-IVT210 system (Industrial Vision Technology (s) Pte Ltd) with monochromatic light focused on a device. For the device stability, the test of the non-encapsulated solar cell was carried in a nitrogen glovebox under 100 mW cm −2
without UV filter. The ToF-SIMS was measured by PHI nanoTOFII Time-of-Flight SIMS. The depth profiling was obtained through a 4 KV Ar ion gun of 400 × 400 µm area. Film characterization X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was carried out on a Thermo-VG Scientific (ESCALAB 250) system with a monochromatized Al Kα (for XPS mode) under a pressure of 5.0 × 10 −7
Pa. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on a JEOL-JSM-6330F system. The surface morphology and roughness of the perovskite film were collected by atomic force microscope (AFM) (Bruker Dimension FastScan). STEM and HAADF-STEM was performed on FEI titan Themis STEM. UV-Vis absorption spectra were measured by UV-3600Plus (Shimadzu). Space charge limited current (SCLC) was recorded on Keithley 2400 meter. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay for carrier lifetime were measured via a Photoluminescence Spectrometer FLS 1000. PL mapping images were measured by Horiba LabRam HR Evolution Raman system. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed by Thermo-Fisher Nicolet NXR 9650 system. Pathway sampling In this work, we utilized the SSW pathway sampling method to explore the phase transition pathway of α-phase to δ-phase. In the SSW method, the movement on the potential surface is guided by the random soft mode (second derivative) direction, which is capable to explore potential energy surface exhaustively and unbiasedly. In this work, the pathway sampling is carried out in a 72-atom supercell, and more than 100 pairs of initial state /final state (IS/FS) are collected in DFT level. Based on the IS/FS pairs datasets, the pathways connecting the initial structure and the final structure can be determined in an atom-to-atom correspondence, then the transition state can be seamlessly located by using the variable-cell double-ended surface walking approach (VC-DESW). After transition state searching, the lowest energy barrier pathways can be determined by sorting the energy barriers. DFT calculations All DFT calculations were performed using
VASP
(5.3.5 version), where the electron-ion interaction of C, N, H, Pb and I atoms were represented by the projector augmented wave (PAW) scheme. The exchange-correlation functional was described by the generalized gradient approximation in the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof parametrization 39 . The energy cutoff of the plane wave was set to 400 eV. The Monkhorst– Pack k-point mesh is set to (2 × 2 × 1). For all the structures, both lattice and atomic positions were fully optimized until the maximal stress component is below 0.1 GPa and the maximal force component below 0.02 eV/Å. In the surface model, the FAPbI 3
surface are 4 layers, the bottom one-layer atom fixed which mimics the bulk of FAPbI 3
while the top three-layer can move freely during the optimization. The PbC 2 O 4
layer is 1 ML on the I-terminal FAPbI 3
surface with the Pb bonded with one I and four O. Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the  Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary

Materials for energy and catalysis Solar cells
Abstract Three-dimensional/low-dimensional perovskite solar cells afford improved efficiency and stability. The design of low-dimensional capping materials is constrained to tuning the A-site organic cation, as Pb 2+
and Sn 2+
are the only options for the metal cation. Here we unlock access to a library of low-dimensional capping materials with metal cations beyond Pb 2+ /Sn 2+
by processing a full precursor solution containing both metal and ammonium halides. This enables easier synthetic control of the low-dimensional capping layer and greater versatility for low-dimensional interface engineering. We demonstrate that a zero-dimensional zinc-based halogenometallate (PEA 2 ZnX 4 ; PEA = phenethylammonium, X = Cl/I) induces more robust surface passivation and stronger n–N isotype three-dimensional/low-dimensional heterojunctions than its lead-based counterpart. We exhibit p–i–n solar cells with 24.1% efficiency (certified 23.25%). Our cells maintain 94.5% initial efficiency after >1,000 h of operation at the maximum power point. Our findings expand the material library for low-dimensional interface engineering and stabilization of highly efficient three-dimensional/low-dimensional perovskite solar cells.

Main Bi-layered three-dimensional/low-dimensional (3D/LD) perovskite solar cell (PSC) architecture recently emerged as an extremely promising approach to resolve the compromise between photovoltaic performance and operational stability 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 . The superincumbent LD capping layer plays a crucial role not only in surface passivation, but also heterojunction construction and environmental stress resistance 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 . The most common LD capping materials are types of halogenometallate, such as the popular two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden–Popper perovskites with the general formula of A 2 MX 4
(refs.
17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 ), where A is a bulky ammonium cation, M is a metal cation and X is a halide anion. The widely adopted manufacturing process for the LD capping layer is to deposit a bulky ammonium halide such as phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) on top of a 3D perovskite, followed by a cation exchange reaction 14 , 16 , which is known as the half precursor (HP) methodology. The metal cation of the LD capping materials is restricted to Pb 2+ /Sn 2+
and is almost irreplaceable in the current methodology as they are derived from the underlying 3D perovskite. Hence, the most popular strategy in new LD capping materials design is to engineer bulky molecular cations at the A-site 12 , 13 , 16 . Although an interesting solid-state in-plane growth method was recently demonstrated to have good controllability specifically for 2D BA 2 PbI 4
(where BA is butylammonium) on top of 3D perovskites 5 , the intrinsically weak solid-state interaction/reaction and high-pressure (60 MPa) requirements may limit its applicability to LD materials with metal cations that are distinct from the underlying 3D perovskite layer. Tailoring the metal cation of LD capping materials so far remains an open question. Expanding the library of LD capping materials with metal cations different from those in 3D perovskites opens up another exciting lever for engineering the energy levels and optoelectronic properties of the LD interface for high-efficiency 3D/LD PSCs. Herein we developed a full precursor (FP) solution methodology for LD capping layer deposition, where an FP solution containing both the metal halide and bulky ammonium halide—instead of the traditional HP solution containing only the bulky ammonium halide—is directly spin-coated on top of a 3D perovskite. Our approach enables easier synthetic control of the LD capping layer compared with the traditional HP process due to the co-existence of both ammonium halide and metal halide. This ensures that the metal cation reactant is no longer limited by the upward diffusion from the underlying 3D perovskite layer. Importantly, our approach allows unprecedented access to the vast library of metal cations beyond the widespread use of Pb 2+ /Sn 2+
for LD capping materials, thus affording fresh opportunities for optimizing the interface alignment and charge transfer properties for efficient PSCs. We discovered that the zero-dimensional (0D) zinc-based halogenometallate (PEA 2 ZnX 4 ; PEA = phenethylammonium, X = Cl/I) with a β-K 2 SO 4 -type single crystal structure 24
functions as a more effective surface capping material for 3D perovskites. By contrast to the lead-based counterpart, PEA 2 ZnX 4
can induce better surface passivation and stronger n–N isotype heterojunctions, which in turn results in substantial suppression of charge recombination and remarkable enhancement of the built-in potential ( V bi ). Consequently, in combination with a traditional surface passivation molecule tris(2,4-di- tert -butylphenyl) phosphite (TPPi), we achieved one of the highest power-conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 24.1% for p–i–n-structured PSCs with negligible hysteresis; the corresponding certified PCE reached 23.25%. The target PSC also exhibited enhanced stability, retaining 94.5% of the initial PCE after 1,009 h of operation at the maximum power point (MPP) under an equivalent effective irradiance of 1 sun. Our findings pave the way forward to expand the toolkit of LD capping materials with metal cations different from those in 3D perovskites. Our study opens a valuable research avenue for engineering efficient 3D/LD PSCs. Fabrication and characterization of 3D/LD stack films A comparison between the proposed FP and traditional HP processes is shown in Fig.  1a . The solvent of the HP solution is generally prepared using an antisolvent such as isopropanol, whereas a slightly more polar solvent (acetonitrile, ACN) is used to dissolve the FP components, especially the metal halide. Details on the FP process are provided in the
Methods
(Supplementary Video  1 ). For simplicity, we chose PEA 2 PbI 4
and PEA 2 ZnX 4
(X = Cl/I) as representatives of the FP-based LD capping materials, with structures given in Fig.  1b . On the other hand, the ubiquitous PEAI was chosen as a representative for the HP capping method. Notably, the distinguishable characteristic low-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks (Fig.  1c
and Supplementary Fig.  1a ) provide strong and direct evidence for verifying the presence of corresponding LD materials in the 3D/LD films 12 . As a result, the deposited PEA 2 PbI 4
was fully converted into the quasi-2D PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
(where FA is formamidinium) through a reaction with the bottom 3D perovskite of either Rb 0.05 Cs 0.10 FA 0.85 PbI 2.8 Cl 0.2
(abbreviated as Rb 5 Cs 10 ; Fig.  1d
and Supplementary Fig.  1b ) or Cs 0.15 FA 0.85 PbI 2.8 Cl 0.2
(abbreviated as Cs 15 ; Fig.  1e
and Supplementary Fig.  1c ). However, for the conventional capping method, PEAI salt still partially remained on both 3D perovskites under the same post-treatment, although most of it transformed into PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
(Fig.  1d,e ). The superior controllability of our FP technique for growth of the LD overlayer is further confirmed by the successful realization of a 2D (NMA) 2 PbI 4
(where NMA is 1-naphthylmethylammonium) capping layer with superior intrinsic stability 25
on a 3D perovskite (Supplementary Fig.  2 ), which is inaccessible via the traditional HP process due to the difficult reaction between the 1-naphthylmethylammonium iodide salt and the 3D perovskite 26 . Interestingly, we found that both PEA 2 ZnX 4
and PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
phases were detected in the Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 ZnX 4
film (Fig.  1d ), but only PEA 2 ZnX 4
was present in the Cs 15 /PEA 2 ZnX 4
film (Fig.  1e ). It is also noted that halide exchange between I −
in PEA 2 ZnX 4
and Cl −
in either Rb 5 Cs 10
or Cs 15
perovskite always occurs, ultimately leading to a chloride-rich composition of PEA 2 ZnI 4− x Cl x
( x  ≥ 2) (Fig.  1d,e ), where the estimated values of
x
are presented in Supplementary Table  1 . Henceforth, we describe the zinc-based capping component using the simplified formula of PEA 2 ZnX 4
unless specified otherwise, where X is Cl − , I −
or their mixture. Fig. 1: Fabrication diagram of the 3D/LD stack films and structural characterization. a , Comparison of the proposed full precursor (FP) and traditional half precursor (HP) processes for preparing the 3D/LD stack films. ACN, acetonitrile; IPA, isopropanol.

and Rb 5 Cs 10
perovskite, we investigated the RbCl/PEA 2 ZnX 4
stack film under similar conditions and discovered that Rb +
partially exchanged with PEA +
to generate PEAX salt (Supplementary Fig.  3 ). The exchanged Rb +
is probably incorporated into the PEA 2 ZnX 4
structure to form (PEA 1− y Rb y ) 2 ZnX 4 , which is a reasonable deduction as the full-width at half-maximum value for the characteristic diffraction peak of PEA 2 ZnX 4
almost doubled (Supplementary Fig.  3 ), and considering that Rb 2 ZnX 4
has the same β-K 2 SO 4 -type crystal structure as PEA 2 ZnX 4
(refs.
24 , 27 ). Hence we conclude that the PEA 2 ZnX 4
capping layer partially reacted with the Rb 5 Cs 10
perovskite to generate (PEA 1− y Rb y ) 2 ZnX 4
and PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
via the cation exchange between Rb +
and PEA + . The possible reactions between the studied LD capping materials and the 3D perovskites are summarized in Supplementary Table  2 . We further determined the possible conversion ratio of PEA 2 ZnX 4
in the Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 ZnX 4
stack film by means of a rough quantitative XRD analysis (Supplementary Fig.  4
and Supplementary Table  3 ), in which the relative amount of phases present was estimated by using the integral intensity of the corresponding characteristic diffraction peak. Considering the identical preparation and measurement conditions, and similar chemical environments for both Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 ZnX 4
and Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 PbI 4
stack films, it is plausible to assume that the crystallinity and texture of PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
in both stack films are roughly consistent, suggesting that the ratio of PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
in Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 ZnX 4
to that in Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 PbI 4
can be estimated by directly comparing the corresponding integral intensities of the PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
diffraction peak. It is also inferred that the PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
diffraction peak intensity of Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 ZnX 4
should approach that of Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 PbI 4
if PEA 2 ZnX 4
is fully converted into PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7 . This is because PEA 2 PbI 4
shows a complete transformation into PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
in Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 PbI 4 , and the contents of PEA +
in both stack films are probably equivalent due to the same fabrication conditions. Accordingly, a conversion ratio of ~10% of PEA 2 ZnX 4
in Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 ZnX 4
was obtained by simply comparing the PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
diffraction peak intensity of Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 ZnX 4
with that of Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 PbI 4
(Supplementary Table  3 ), indicating that ~90% of PEA 2 ZnX 4
in Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 ZnX 4
was retained. To examine the reliability of the results, a similar analysis was performed to directly calculate the retention ratio of PEA 2 ZnX 4
in Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 ZnX 4
by comparing the PEA 2 ZnX 4
diffraction peak intensity of Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 ZnX 4
with that of Cs 15 /PEA 2 ZnX 4 , which led to a similar retention ratio of ~90% (Supplementary Table  3 ). Meanwhile, ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption spectra of both Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEAI and Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 PbI 4
films based on a relatively thin Rb 5 Cs 10
layer exhibit a clear and strong excitonic absorption peak at ~570 nm corresponding to PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7 , which is barely observed for the Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 ZnX 4
film (Supplementary Fig.  5 ). It can therefore be deduced that PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
is a minor capping by-product in the Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 ZnX 4
film, although it is difficult to directly identify PEA 2 ZnX 4
in the UV–vis spectrum of the Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 ZnX 4
film due to the intrinsic weak absorption of PEA 2 ZnX 4
(Supplementary Fig.  5 ). This is in accordance with the above quantitative XRD analysis results. In summary, the capped PEA 2 ZnX 4
primarily remained on the Rb 5 Cs 10
perovskite, and there is only a slight reaction with Rb 5 Cs 10
perovskite to produce a small amount of PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
by-product. We further assessed the orientation of the LD capping material with respect to the substrate using grazing incidence wide/small angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS/GISAXS) (Fig.  1f , Supplementary Figs.  6 – 10
and Supplementary Note  1 ). The control 3D film exhibits Debye–Scherrer-like rings, and the 3D/LD stack films show additional Bragg spots whose positions correspond with those of the relevant peaks in their XRD patterns. Interestingly, all of the Bragg spots shown in the studied 3D/LD stack films are located along the
Q z
direction, indicating that the LD capping materials are oriented preferentially with the (0 k 0) planes parallel to the substrate (that is, the
b -axis is oriented perpendicular to the substrate). This is consistent with the orientation of most reported LD capping materials prepared via the conventional HP methodology 8 , 10 . The presence and distribution of the zinc-based capping layer on the 3D perovskite surface was further identified using high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) (Supplementary Fig.  11 ), as well as time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS) (Supplementary Fig.  12 ). Furthermore, the zinc-based capping material probably forms a film on 3D perovskite surface, which inferred from its distribution form on the ITO substrate (Supplementary Fig.  13 ). Lattice microstrain analysis (Supplementary Table  4 ) suggests that the zinc-based capping layer hardly induces any additional lattice strain for the bottom 3D perovskite although their crystal structures are different. It is also noted that our FP-based capping solution barely changes the cross-sectional morphology of the underlying 3D perovskite (Supplementary Fig.  14 ), which indicates negligible damage to the underlying 3D perovskite. Furthermore, all of the capping layers are found to effectively reduce the roughness of the 3D perovskite film (Supplementary Fig.  15 ), which is probably attributed to the filling of 3D perovskite surface valley regions by the capping materials. Photovoltaic performance comparison of 3D/LD PSCs We then investigated the p–i–n-structured 3D/LD PSCs with a general configuration of ITO/PTAA/3D/LD/C 60 /BCP/Ag (Fig.  2a ), where ITO is indium tin oxide, PTAA is poly(triarylamine), BCP is bathocuproine and the 3D perovskite is Rb 5 Cs 10
unless specified otherwise. In Fig.
2b–e
and Supplementary Table
5
we compare the open-circuit voltage ( V OC ), short-circuit current density ( J SC ), fill factor and PCE for the control and target PSCs with various capping materials fabricated either via the traditional HP-based process or our FP-based one. The capping layers were prepared using their respective optimum conditions for a fair comparison (Supplementary Table  6 ). Compared with the control device with an average PCE of 19.3% ± 0.3%, both the traditional HP-based 3D/PEAI device and the FP-based 3D/PEA 2 PbI 4
device showed improved performances of 20.5% ± 0.8% and 20.8% ± 0.5%, respectively, whereas the 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
device demonstrated an even greater improvement with a PCE of 22.2% ± 0.3%. These improvements are mainly ascribed to the enhanced
V OC . The comparable performance between the FP-based 3D/PEA 2 PbI 4
and HP-based 3D/PEAI devices is attributed to the similar ultimate capping component (PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7 ). The better reproducibility (narrower PCE distribution) of the FP-based 3D/PEA 2 PbI 4
device is probably due to the superior synthetic control of the LD capping layer by the FP technique. These results validated the feasibility and superiority of our FP technique for efficient 3D/LD PSCs. The outstanding performance of the 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
device advocates the potential advantages of PEA 2 ZnX 4
serving as the LD capping material in 3D/LD PSCs, which is also available in relatively large-area (~1 cm 2 ) devices (Supplementary Table  7 ). We note that the key capping component for the high-performance 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
device should be the intrinsic PEA 2 ZnX 4
and not the PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
by-product because the PEA 2 ZnX 4
residual is the main capping component (accounting for ~90%) in the 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
stack film, as demonstrated above. To eliminate the interference from the small amount of PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
by-product, similar PSCs based on the Cs 15
perovskite were also investigated, considering that PEA 2 ZnX 4
can fully remain on the Cs 15
perovskite, as demonstrated above. Consequently, a similar performance improvement was demonstrated (Supplementary Table  8 ), further confirming the intrinsic superiority of PEA 2 ZnX 4
as the LD capping material in 3D/LD PSCs.

Full size image Optoelectronic properties evolution in 3D/LD PSCs To explicate the underlying reasons for the extraordinary enhancement of device performance by the PEA 2 ZnX 4
capping material, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) analysis was conducted to characterize the non-radiative recombination losses of charge carriers in the perovskite films. In view of similar ultimate capping components and comparable performances for both the HP-based 3D/PEAI and FP-based 3D/PEA 2 PbI 4
devices, the 3D/PEAI stack film was taken as the representative of the lead-based counterpart for comparison. As shown in Fig.  3a , both 3D/PEAI and 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
stack films exhibit long tails in their pseudo-colour TRPL plots relative to the control film under the same excitation fluence of 0.177 µJ cm −2
at 640 nm, indicating longer photoluminescence lifetimes. A more distinct comparison of TRPL decay kinetics is illustrated in Fig.  3b . Fluence-dependent TRPL analysis and corresponding global fits were performed to extract the specific rate constant ( k 1 ) and lifetime ( τ ) for trap-mediated non-radiative recombination, that is, Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination (Supplementary Figs.  17 – 19
and Supplementary Note  2 ). In comparison with the control 3D perovskite, a more substantial decrease of
k 1
and increase of
τ
were observed for 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
compared with a conventional 3D/PEAI (Supplementary Table  9 ), implying the superiority of PEA 2 ZnX 4
over a traditional lead-based counterpart for surface passivation to suppress charge recombination. As demonstrated in most past works 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , the chemical passivation effect of the halogenometallate family of capping materials is mainly rooted in their interactions with the A-site cation vacancy (V A ) and halide vacancy (V X ) defects, which are regarded as the dominant defect types on 3D perovskite surface. Similarly, in our case, both the main surface capping component PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
in the conventional 3D/PEAI film and PEA 2 ZnX 4
in the 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
film enable interactions with the V A
and V X
defects depending on the cationic ammonium group (−NH 3 + ) and halide anion in their structures (Supplementary Fig.  20 ). Although both the PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
and PEA 2 ZnX 4
passivators possess the same passivating groups, their interactions with defects may vary due to different chemical environments and structures leading to discrepant passivation effects. On one hand, the calculated electrostatic potential (ESP) maps of PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
and PEA 2 ZnX 4
showed almost identical ESP for the −NH 3 +
groups in both passivators (Supplementary Fig.  21a,b ), indicating that the passivation effects induced by the −NH 3 +
groups are probably similar for both passivators. We observe a slightly more negative ESP for the halide anion in tetrahedral [ZnI 4 ] than in octahedral [PbI 6 ] (Supplementary Fig.  21c,d ), which is in accordance with the smaller electronegativity of zinc relative to lead. This is conducive to inducing relatively stronger interactions between the halide anion in PEA 2 ZnX 4
and the positively charged V X
defect, and thus contributing to the superior passivation effect. On the other hand, the isolated tetrahedral [ZnI 4 ] structure in 0D PEA 2 ZnX 4
is relatively relaxed compared with the strained connected octahedral [PbI 6 ] structure in the quasi-2D PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
(Supplementary Fig.  22 ), which facilitates effective interactions between passivating groups and the defects. Another possible reason for the superiority of PEA 2 ZnX 4
may be related to modification of interface energy level alignment, which is discussed below. Fig. 3: Comparison of optoelectronic properties. a , Pseudo-colour TRPL plots of the control 3D perovskite, 3D/PEAI and 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4

V bi
values estimated from the saturated null voltage are 1.13 V, 1.19 V and 1.23 V, respectively. Full size image Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) analysis was conducted to examine the surface potential evolution of the perovskite films with different capping materials. Figure  3c
presents the KPFM images of the control 3D, 3D/PEAI and 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
stack films, with the colour-scale bar representing the contact potential difference (CPD) between the tip and sample surface. As 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
exhibits the highest average CPD value (Fig.  3d ), it implies that PEA 2 ZnX 4
induces a more substantial decrease in the surface work function than the traditional lead-based counterpart. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) analysis was also performed to determine the Fermi levels and valence band maxima of the surfaces of pristine 3D, 3D/PEAI and 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
stack films (Fig.  3e ). It should be noted that the mentioned Fermi levels here are actually quasi-Fermi levels. The conduction band minima were then extrapolated in relation to the optical bandgaps, which were estimated from the UV–vis spectra of pristine 3D perovskite, PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
and PEA 2 ZnICl 3
(Supplementary Fig.  23 ). Note that, in our case, the bandgaps of the surface capping components in the 3D/PEAI and 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
stack films were approximated from those of pristine PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
and PEA 2 ZnICl 3
films. This is because the initially capped PEAI and PEA 2 ZnX 4
will mostly convert into PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
and PEA 2 ZnICl 3 , respectively (Supplementary Table  1 ), after post-treatment, as shown above. As presented in the resulting energy level diagram (Fig.  3f ), all Fermi levels of the 3D perovskite and surface capping components are much closer to their conduction band minima, revealing n-type properties. Furthermore, the Fermi level of the surface capping component in 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
(−3.98 eV) is relatively higher than that in 3D/PEAI (−4.15 eV) and both are effectively enhanced relative to the control 3D perovskite (−4.42 eV), which is in agreement with the KPFM results. Importantly, the specific energy level alignment in either 3D/PEAI or 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
conduced to construct an n–N isotype heterojunction with an additional built-in electric field pointing from the surface to the bulk (Fig.  3f
and Supplementary Note  3 ), which is responsible for enhancement of
V bi
and in turn
V OC
(refs.
28 , 29 ). As the additional
V bi
is dominated by the Fermi level difference at the junction 28 , 29 , 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
can theoretically induce a stronger n–N isotype heterojunction and produce a higher additional
V bi
by virtue of a larger Fermi level difference relative to the conventional 3D/PEAI. The possible
V bi
variation was further investigated by the photosaturation method for the control, 3D/PEAI and 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
PSCs (Supplementary Note  4 ). As predicted, the 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
led to a larger increase of
V bi
compared with the traditional 3D/PEAI (Fig.  3g ), which is consistent with the
V OC
evolution. On the other hand, the specific built-in electric field at the n–N isotype heterojunction probably induces a departure of holes at the 3D perovskite surface, resulting in decreased hole concentration, which is advantageous for reducing the SRH recombination at the surface (Supplementary Fig.  24 ) because the SRH recombination rate is strongly dependent on the surface concentration of the minority carrier 30 . This effect is commonly known in silicon solar cells as field-effect passivation 30 , which has also been reported in PSCs recently 31 . Accordingly, there is probably stronger field-effect passivation in 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
on account of a relatively larger built-in electric field at the corresponding n–N isotype heterojunction, which is also responsible for the superior passivation effect of PEA 2 ZnX 4 . Furthermore, the relatively deeper valence band maximum of the surface capping component can also induce a barrier for holes between the 3D perovskite layer and the C 60
electron transporting layer, which effectively restrains undesired recombination at the perovskite/C 60
interface caused by the adverse band tail states of C 60
(ref.
32
and Supplementary Fig.  25 ). The slightly higher hole barrier in 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
also contributes to greater suppression of charge recombination, thus improving device performance. Device performance and stability of 3D/LD PSCs To further improve device performance, we also introduced TPPi—a traditional surface passivation molecule—to the best-performing 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
PSCs, considering that the relatively rough 3D perovskite surface probably cannot be sufficiently covered by the PEA 2 ZnX 4
capping layer, which has a narrow optimum thickness (~20 nm) (Supplementary Figs.  13 ,
15 ,
16
and
26 , and Supplementary Note  3 ). The chemical structure of the TPPi molecule is presented in Supplementary Fig.  27 , and its passivation efficacy was confirmed by the reduced
k 1
and increased
τ
of the 3D/TPPi film compared with the pristine 3D perovskite film (Supplementary Figs.  17
and
28 , and Supplementary Table  10 ), as well as a slight increase in PCE of the 3D/TPPi PSCs (Supplementary Table  11 ), which has also been demonstrated by other similar molecules 33 . As a result, we obtained a maximum PCE of 24.1% with a
V OC
of 1.198 V, a
J SC
of 24 mA cm −2 , a fill factor of 83.9% and negligible hysteresis (Fig.  4a ). The device also exhibited an average stable power output of 23.5% at the MPP (Supplementary Fig.  29 ) and good reproducibility, with an average PCE of 22.9% over 103 individual cells (Fig.  4b
and Supplementary Table  12 ). The measured
J SC
was validated by the integrated
J SC
from the external quantum efficiency spectrum (Fig.  4c ), with a reasonable relative discrepancy of less than 2%. Our PSCs were also evaluated by an independent national institute, Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS), which offers a high-precision solar simulator with an almost ideal spectral mismatch factor of 1.01 for our PSCs. A certified PCE of 23.25% was obtained (Supplementary Fig.  30 ). Fig. 4: Device performance and stability. a , Current density–voltage ( J – V ) curves of the champion 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4

The device temperature was around 40 °C during the test. The error bars denote the s.d. for three different measurements, and the centres of the error bars are mean values.
e ,
J – V
curves of the target PSC before and after MPP tracking for 1,009 h. Source data Full size image Finally, we examined the operational stability of the 3D/LD PSCs based on our FP technology. The operational stability tests were performed at the MPP in a N 2 -filled glovebox (O 2  < 10 ppm, H 2 O < 1 ppm) under illumination of a white light-emitting diode (LED) lamp with an equivalent effective irradiance of 1 sun. It is noted that the Cs 15
3D perovskite and the hybrid LD capping layer of PEA 2 PbI 4 −PEA 2 ZnX 4
were included in the PSCs for the stability tests, considering that a comparable device performance was achieved for the 3D/PEA 2 PbI 4 –PEA 2 ZnX 4
PSC relative to the 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
PSC (Supplementary Table  13 ), which is due to the intrinsic superiority of PEA 2 ZnX 4 , as demonstrated above. Consequently, 94.5% of the initial PCE was maintained after 1,009 h of MPP operation for the target PSC, which is remarkably enhanced compared with the control PSC (Fig.  4d,e ). To reveal the possible reasons for the stability improvement induced by the LD capping layer, we investigated the surface morphology and defects evolution of the relevant perovskite films after aging them under 1 sun illumination in air without encapsulation. As illustrated in Supplementary Figs.  31
and
32 , the LD capping layer effectively inhibited the generation of surface pinholes on the 3D perovskite film, which probably results from the blocking of H 2 O/O 2
penetration/erosion by the hydrophobic organic bulky cations within the structure of the LD capping layer (Supplementary Figs.  33
and
34 ) 16 . Moreover, a relatively larger decrease in surface photoluminescence intensity for the control 3D perovskite film was also observed (Supplementary Fig.  35 ), indicating that the LD capping layer is probably favourable for suppressing light-induced production of surface defects due to the robust interaction between the LD capping material and the 3D perovskite surface (Supplementary Fig.  33 ). To further verify the role of the LD capping layer in device stability improvement, we also performed the 85 °C heat stability tests for the PSCs under ambient conditions or in N 2
(see
Methods ). As predicted, the target 3D/LD device also showed enhanced heat stability compared with the control 3D device (Supplementary Fig.  36 ). Conclusion Using a full precursor solution methodology in 3D/LD PSCs, we have paved the way forward to expand the toolkit of LD capping materials to include metal cations different from those in 3D perovskites. Compared with the conventional lead-based counterpart, 0D PEA 2 ZnX 4
functions as a more effective LD capping material for 3D perovskites because it induces more robust surface passivation and forms a stronger n–N isotype heterojunction. The resulting 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
PSCs achieved a remarkably improved PCE of 24.1% (certified 23.25%) and enhanced operational stability. Although only the representative PEA 2 PbI 4
and PEA 2 ZnX 4
are presented here in detail, our FP technology also showed broad applicability for other commonly studied LD capping materials such as BA 2 PbI 4
and PMA 2 PbI 4
(where PMA is phenylmethylammonium) (Supplementary Table  14 ), as well as BA 2 ZnX 4
(Supplementary Fig.  37
and Supplementary Table  15 ). Aside from the Zn 2+
cation, our FP technology could potentially unlock access to many other divalent metal cations such as Co 2+
(PEA 2 CoX 4 ) (Supplementary Fig.  38
and Supplementary Table  14 ), Mn 2+ , Cu 2+
and so on, as well as trivalent cations such as Sb 3+ , Bi 3+ , Al 3+
and so on, which are promising for tuning energy level alignments at 3D/LD interfaces and/or enhancing the interface stability more effectively. We therefore believe our findings will unlock new opportunities to develop superior LD capping materials from the vast family of halogenometallates, especially the lead-free ones, for more efficient and stable PSCs as well as impact other perovskite optoelectronics such as LEDs, lasers, photodetectors and so on.

HP and FP capping solution preparation The conventional HP capping solution was prepared by dissolving PEAI in IPA according to ref.
34 . The PEA 2 PbI 4
FP capping solution was prepared by dissolving 31.3 mg PbI 2
and 33.9 mg PEAI in 4 ml ACN (17 mM). The other FP capping solution including BA 2 PbI 4 , PMA 2 PbI 4 , (NMA) 2 PbI 4 , BA 2 ZnX 4
(X = Cl/I), PEA 2 ZnX 4
(X = Cl/I) and PEA 2 CoX 4
(X = Cl/I) was prepared in the same way, with an identical concentration of 17 mM. Note that the mixed solvent with 50 µl methylamine solution in 1 ml ACN was specially used to dissolve the (NMA) 2 PbI 4
precursors. The PEA 2 PbI 4 −PEA 2 ZnX 4
hybrid FP capping solution was prepared by dissolving 62.7 mg PbI 2 , 18.5 mg ZnCl 2
and 135.5 mg PEAI in 8 ml ACN. Device fabrication The patterned ITO-coated glass substrates were ultrasonically cleaned in the following sequence: first with aqueous detergent, followed by deionized water, then acetone and lastly ethyl alcohol for about 20 min in each step; after which the substrates underwent ultraviolet ozone treatment for 15 min before use. All of the spin-coating processes were conducted in a N 2 -filled glovebox (O 2  < 10 ppm, H 2 O < 1 ppm). The hole-transporting PTAA layer was deposited by spin-coating the PTAA solution (2 mg ml −1
in toluene) on cleaned ITO substrates at a speed of 2,000 r.p.m. for 60 s, and then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The Rb 0.05 Cs 0.10 FA 0.85 PbI 2.8 Cl 0.2
(Rb 5 Cs 10 ) perovskite precursor contains 414.9 mg PbI 2 , 27.8 mg PbCl 2 , 146.2 mg FAI, 26.0 mg CsI and 10.6 mg RbI in 1 ml anhydrous DMF:DMSO (4:1, v/v). The Cs 0.15 FA 0.85 PbI 2.8 Cl 0.2
(Cs 15 ) perovskite precursor contains 414.9 mg PbI 2 , 27.8 mg PbCl 2 , 146.2 mg FAI, 39.0 mg CsI in 1 ml anhydrous DMF:DMSO (4:1, v/v). The Cs 0.05 (MA 0.15 FA 0.85 ) 0.95 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
(CsMAFA) perovskite precursor contains 780.3 mg PbI 2 , 112.9 mg PbBr 2 , 277.8 mg FAI, 26.0 mg CsI and 31.9 mg methylammonium bromide in 2 ml anhydrous DMF:DMSO (4:1, v/v). The Rb 5 Cs 10 , Cs 15
and CsMAFA perovskite films were deposited by spin-coating the corresponding precursor solution on the ITO/PTAA substrates at 1,000 r.p.m. for 10 s (5 s ramp) and 4,000 r.p.m. for 45 s (1 s ramp); 150 µl of 1,2-dichlorobenzene was rapidly dropped on the substrates at 10 s before the end of the programme to induce fast crystallization of perovskites. The as-prepared perovskite films were then annealed at 110 °C for 10 min. Next, the HP or FP capping solution was spin-coated on top of the perovskite films at a speed of 5,000 r.p.m. (1,500 r.p.m. was used for XRD and GIWAXS/GISAXS samples for better signals) for 30 s. Note that the FP capping solution should be rapidly injected onto the 3D perovskite surface after the substrate starts spinning to minimize the possible erosion of the underlying 3D perovskite (Supplementary Video  1 ). The films were then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The additional TPPi passivation layer was prepared by spin-coating the TPPi toluene solution (6 mg ml −1 ) at a speed of 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s as required. Finally, 50 nm C 60 , 6 nm BCP and 100 nm silver were thermally evaporated (under a vacuum <5.0 × 10 −4  Pa) in sequence on the films through a metal shadow mask with an active area of 6 mm 2
for small-area devices or 1.218 cm 2
for large-area devices. To minimize reflections and possible edge effects, a 100 nm LiF layer was evaporated onto the glass side of ITO substrates as an anti-reflection layer, and a non-reflective black metal aperture mask with an aperture area around 4 mm 2
for small-area devices or 0.973 cm 2
for large-area devices was also affixed on the glass side of ITO substrates as required. The silver electrode was replaced with the chromium/gold (5 nm/100 nm) electrode in the PSCs for the stability tests. Device characterization The
J − V
curves of the PSCs were recorded with a Keithley 2400 source meter under simulated air mass 1.5 G solar illumination from a ScienceTech UHE-NSC AAA solar simulator. The effective irradiance of the solar simulator for the studied PSCs was adjusted to 1 sun (100 mW cm −2 ) according to our previous method by using an Oriel PV Reference Cell System (91150 V) with calibration of possible spectral mismatch 35 . The
J − V
curves were measured in either a forward or reverse scan direction from −0.2 V to 1.25 V/1.20 V or 1.25 V/1.20 V to −0.2 V at a scan rate of ~0.5 V s −1 . The presented
J − V
curves were obtained in the reverse scan direction at room temperature in a N 2 -filled glovebox (O 2  < 10 ppm, H 2 O < 1 ppm) unless specified otherwise. Note that the
J − V
curves were initially measured without an aperture mask. The measured
J SC
was then calibrated against the value obtained with aperture mask by subtracting the obtained
J SC
difference between the measurements without and with aperture mask in our specific photovoltaic system, although the
J SC
difference was as small as 0.37 mA cm −2
caused by the unaccounted reflections and possible edge effects 36
(Supplementary Table  16 ). The final presented
J − V
curves were obtained from the measurement with an aperture mask or based on the calibrated
J SC
accordingly. The spectral response and external quantum efficiency analysis was performed on a Zolix Solar Cell Scan100 measurement system (Zolix Instruments Company) and QEPVSI-b set-up (Newport). Other characteristics The XRD patterns were measured using a PANalytical X’Pert Pro X-ray diffractometer (copper Kα,
λ  = 1.5418 Å, 40 kV, 30 mA) (PANalytical). All of the GIWAXS/GISAXS patterns were acquired by using the Nano-inXider system of Xenocs. It should be noted that the Nano-inXider of Xenocs can only provide GIWAXS/GISAXS information at different
Ψ
angles between the X-ray beam and sample, rather than the whole pattern. The wavelength of incident X-rays was 1.54189 Å. The incident angle of the X-ray beam was 0.3°. The UV–vis absorption spectra were measured utilizing a Shimadzu UV3600PLUS UV–vis-NIR spectrophotometer. The planar and cross-sectional SEM images were taken on a JEOL JSM-7600F microscope. The atomic force microscopy images were taken on a Bruker Bioscope Resolve system. The sample lamella for TEM measurements was prepared by a focused ion beam (FIB)–SEM system (ZEISS Crossbeam 540). A layer of carbon with a thickness of around 1.3 µm was deposited on top of the sample for protection before the lamella was prepared using the FIB. The first 300 nm of carbon film was deposited using 30 kV and a current of 100 pA; the subsequent 1 µm was deposited using 30 kV and 300 pA. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy images and EDX maps of multiple layers were collected using an aberration-corrected JEOL JEM-ARM200F TEM operated at 200 keV with an Oxford X-Max TLE 100 mm 2
windowless silicon drift detector EDX. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy analysis was performed on a Kratos AXIS Supra spectrometer equipped with a standard helium-discharge lamp with He I photons (21.22 eV). Kelvin probe force microscopy analysis was performed on a Cypher ES Environmental Scanning Probe Microscope (Asylum Research/Oxford Instrument) by using a conductive antimony-doped silicon probe coated with Pt/Ir (SCM-PIT-V2, Bruker), with a resonant frequency of 75 kHz and force constant of 3 N m −1 ; the measurements were performed in the amplitude modulation mode at a lift height of 200 nm above the sample surface, with a typical scan rate of 1.5 Hz. The KPFM samples were deposited on ITO substrates and grounded to the metallic sample holder with conductive silver paint. Note that the three samples compared (control 3D, 3D/PEAI and 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
stack films) were loaded together on the same sample holder; the measurements were performed under the same conditions. It is therefore reasonable to attribute the measured CPD variation between samples to different intrinsic surface properties but not due to other factors. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements were conducted using an Optronis Optoscope streak camera system, with the sample excited by 640 nm femtosecond laser pulses at various fluences, which were generated from a Coherent Libra femtosecond laser system (50 fs, 1 kHz, 800 nm) and a Coherent OPerA Solo optical parametric amplifier. Note that all of the TRPL samples were excited at the sample surface side. The photoluminescence images were recorded using a Nikon Ti2-E Inverted Motorized Microscope system (×20 objective lens) with the sample excited by a 473 nm continuous wave laser and the photoluminescence signals collected by a photomultiplier tube. The TOF-SIMS analysis was performed on a TOF.SIMS 5 (IONTOF) system with detection of positive secondary ions. Water contact angle analysis was performed on a Dataphysics OCA 15 Contact Angle Goniometer. Operational stability test The operational stability test for the studied PSCs was conducted in a N 2 -filled glovebox (O 2  < 10 ppm, H 2 O < 1 ppm) at the MPP under illumination of a white LED lamp with an equivalent effective irradiance of 1 sun. An example of the detailed tracking process is as follows and the involved data are shown in Supplementary Table  17 . First, the initial PCE of the PSC was measured under the simulated air mass 1.5 G AAA solar simulator with an effective irradiance of 1 sun as described above. The obtained initial PCE and
J SC
were labelled as PCE (0h,SS)
and
J SC(0h,SS)
(where SS denotes solar simulator). Second, the PSC was then subjected to the operational test under the white LED lamp irradiation. The effective irradiance of the white LED lamp for the specific PSC was identified as 1 sun when the measured
J SC
(labelled as
J SC(0h,LED) ) was adjusted to approximate the
J SC(0h,SS)
in the first step. A certain voltage bias was then selected and applied to the PSC to generate MPP output by a Keithley 2602B source meter. The PSC was left to continuously operate under this MPP for around 22 h. Third, after the first 22 h of MPP operation, the
J SC
was measured again under the white LED lamp and labelled as
J SC(22h,LED) . The
J SC
was also measured for the same device under solar simulator irradiation and labelled as
J SC(22h,SS) . Note that the possible difference between
J SC(22h,LED)
and
J SC(22h,SS)
may be caused by the irradiance change of the white LED lamp after 22 h of operation but not due to the device performance change between the two measurements, because both
J SC(22h,LED)
and
J SC(22h,SS)
were measured at the same time. The negligible difference between
J SC(22h,LED)
and
J SC(22h,SS)
indicated the relatively stable irradiance of our white LED lamp. Fourth, the longer operational tests were similarly conducted by repeating steps two and three. Note that the presented operational stability results were based on the PCE data measured under the solar simulator irradiation. Heat stability test The 85 °C heat stability test was conducted under ambient conditions (relative humidity ≈ 50%) or in a N 2 -filled glovebox (O 2  < 10 ppm, H 2 O < 1 ppm). A simple basic encapsulation is made for the device before the start of the test in air, and there is no encapsulation for the device tested in N 2 . The simple basic encapsulation was achieved by directly storing the original device in a small commercial air-tight box, which was then put into an 85 °C oven for the test. It should be noted that the simple basic encapsulation is unable to completely prevent exposure to air. The widely used triple-cation CsMAFA 3D perovskite was used in the relevant device for the test. DFT calculations The ESP maps of PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
and PEA 2 ZnI 4 —based on their single crystal structures—are calculated using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package 37 . We use the all-electron-like projector augmented-wave method 38 , and the PW86R exchange 39
and PBE correlation 40
potential as implemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package code. The semi-core of lead atoms (5 d
orbital) is treated as valence electrons, that is, 14 valence electrons for a lead (5 d 10 6 s 2 6 p 2 ) atom. The cut-off energy for the plane wave expansion of the wave functions is 500 eV. The lattice constants of PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
and PEA 2 ZnI 4
are listed in Supplementary Table  18 . All atoms in the unit cell are fully optimized. The Hellman–Feynman forces are smaller than 1 meV Å −1 . The 4 × 4 × 1 and 4 × 1 × 3 Monkhorst-Pack grid of k-points 41
for Brillouin zone integration of PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
and PEA 2 ZnI 4 , respectively, are employed in the DFT calculations. The vdW-DF2 (ref.
39 ) method is used to calculate the van der Waals interaction. The related ESP maps are generated using the Visualization for Electronic and Structural Analysis software (Version 3, retrieved from

Devices for energy harvesting Photovoltaics Solar cells
Abstract The main bottlenecks limiting the photovoltaic performance and stability of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are trap-assisted non-radiative recombination losses and photochemical degradation at the interface between perovskite and charge-transport layers. We propose a strategy to manipulate the crystallization of methylammonium-free perovskite by incorporating a small amount of 2-aminoindan hydrochloride into the precursor inks. This additive also modulates carrier recombination and extraction dynamics at the buried interface via the formation of a bottom-up two-dimensional/three-dimensional heterojunction. The resultant inverted PSC achieves a power conversion efficiency of 25.12% (certified 24.6%) at laboratory scale (0.09 cm 2 ) and 22.48% at a larger area (1 cm 2 ) with negligible hysteresis. More importantly, the resulting unencapsulated devices show superior operational stability, maintaining >98% of their initial efficiency of >24% after 1,500 hours of continuous maximum power point tracking under simulated AM1.5 illumination. Meanwhile, the encapsulated devices retain >92% of initial performance for 1,200 hours under the damp-heat test (85 °C and 85% relative humidity).

In situ energetics modulation enables high-efficiency and stable inverted perovskite solar cells

Main Inverted (p-i-n) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently drawn intensive attention, owing to their merits of compatibility with different bottom cells for tandem solar cells 1 , 2 , low-temperature processability 3 , 4
and excellent stability 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 . Researchers have carried out numerous studies to improve the performance and stability of inverted PSCs, such as compositional engineering 10 , additive engineering 11 , 12 , processing methods 13
and interface engineering 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 14 , 15 , 16 . Although the efficiency of inverted PSCs has increased substantially over the years 12 , methylammonium (MA + ) and bromide (Br − ) are usually employed to modulate the crystal growth and stabilize the photoactive black phase of formamidinium lead triiodide (α-FAPbI 3 ) 4 , 12 , 17 , 18 . However, since MA +
was certified to easily volatilize and escape from the perovskite crystal lattices, large amounts of MA +
doping (≥10 mol%) would cause material degradation of α-FAPbI 3
at high temperatures and thus reduce thermal stability of the corresponding PSCs 19 , 20 . In addition, mixed halide (I/Br) perovskites inevitably suffer from phase segregation, which is exacerbated under light illumination and thermal ageing 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 . In the long run, MA- and Br-free perovskite is highly desirable for the fabrication of long-term operationally stable perovskite solar cells 26 . To overcome the above problems, caesium (Cs + ) cations have been widely adopted to prepare more stable mixed cation perovskites Cs x FA 1− x PbI 3
(refs.
27 , 28 ). While the doping of a small amount (≤5 mol%) of Cs +
has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy for stabilizing the α-FAPbI 3
(refs.
4 , 29 , 30 ), without the incorporation of MA +
and Br − , it is still challenging to manipulate the crystallization dynamics of Cs x FA 1− x PbI 3
on a planar substrate, such as the hydrophobic poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine) (PTAA) films. Therefore, a facile modulation approach for preparing MA + - and Br − -free perovskite film should be urgently developed to further enhance the performance of inverted PSCs. Interfacial non-radiative recombination poses a serious challenge for the further advancement of the photovoltaic performance of inverted PSCs 31 . Recently, great efforts have been made to manipulate the perovskite/electron transport layer (ETL) interface 4 , 6 , 7 , 8 . For example, Zhu and coworkers employed an organometallic compound (FcTc 2 ) to modify the perovskite/C60 interface and achieved an attractive performance due to effective defect passivation and ameliorated interfacial electron transfer 8 . In contrast to the perovskite/ETL top interface, the buried perovskite/hole transport layer (HTL) interface receives less attention. Considering most interfacial modulation molecules are easy to dissolve in polar solvents, that is,
N,N -dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), while spin-coating perovskite precursor solution, it is much more difficult to modulate the HTL/perovskite buried interface compared with the top interface. The HTL/perovskite buried interface contains a high density of deep-level trap states, which is much larger than that within the perovskite film 32 . The NiO x /perovskite interface also suffers from poor photostability because of interfacial reactions 33 , 34 . In addition, the energy barrier at the buried interface leads to imperfect interfacial hole extraction and thus low photovoltaic performance 35 , 36 . Consequently, it is urgently needed to minimize non-radiative recombination losses at the HTL/perovskite buried interface and enhance interfacial stability in inverted PSCs by facile interface engineering. Interestingly, Wakamiya and coworkers 37
modified the HTL/perovskite buried interface by directly incorporating glycine hydrochloride into the perovskite precursor ink. They revealed that the head group (–NH 3 + ) of GlyH +
can bind to the surface of perovskite crystallites, which prefer to sediment at the bottom interface. Finally, the –NH 3 +
head was towards the perovskite layer, while the tail group (–COOH) was anchored to HTL, forming an interfacial dipole and thus electric field, which accelerated hole extraction and transfer. This indicates that appropriate ammonium salts would self-assemble at the buried interface when it is introduced into the precursor solution. Since two-dimensional (2D) perovskites have been widely employed to modify grain boundaries (GBs) and the surface of three-dimensional (3D) perovskites 6 , 7 , constructing a bottom-up 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction is highly desirable through incorporating tailored organic ammonium salts into the precursor ink. Herein we manipulated the crystallization of MA-free perovskite film (for example, Cs 0.05 FA 0.95 PbI 3 ) and minimized the interfacial non-radiative recombination losses simultaneously by incorporating a small amount of 2-aminoindan hydrochloride (AICl) into the perovskite precursor inks. This strategy enabled high-quality MA-free perovskite films with improved crystallization, fewer trap states and enhanced interfacial hole extraction and transport, which stabilized this important interface and minimized non-radiative recombination losses. The resultant inverted device delivered a PCE of 25.12% (certified 24.6%) at laboratory scale (0.09 cm 2 ) and 22.48% at larger device area (1 cm 2 ) with negligible hysteresis. Moreover, the resulting unencapsulated device demonstrated excellent operational stability by maintaining >98% of its initial efficiency after 1,500 hours of continuous maximum power point (MPP) tracking under simulated AM1.5 illumination. The outstanding damp-heat stability was confirmed for an encapsulated device, which retained >92% of the initial PCE value after 1,200 hours ageing at 85 °C and 85% relative humidity (RH). Characterization of MA-free perovskite films We adopted a stable MA- and Br-free perovskite composition (Cs 0.05 FA 0.95 PbI 3 ) as light absorber to maximize the performance of inverted PSCs. The perovskite film was fabricated through a one-step method. To regulate the crystallization of Cs 0.05 FA 0.95 PbI 3
films, we added a small amount of AICl into the perovskite precursor inks to form a 2D/3D heterojunction at the bottom interface. The chemical structure of AICl is shown in Supplementary Fig.
1 . The perovskite films and the relevant devices made with incorporation of AICl are hereafter denoted as ‘target’. To form 2D perovskite at the bottom interface, we designed a large indan aromatic tail with large π-conjugation, which was attached to an ammonium A-site cation (-NH 3 + ). Owing to the large size of the indan aromatic skeleton, the solubility of AICl molecules in DMF/DMSO mixed solvents is very low (Supplementary Fig.
2 ). Meanwhile, the interactions between AI +
and PbI 2
are stronger than that of FA + , which leads to easier formation of 2D perovskites than 3D perovskites, as evidenced by
1 H NMR spectra (Supplementary Fig.
3 ). Considering the low solubility and stronger interaction towards PbI 2 , we infer that an AI-based 2D perovskite ((AI) 2 (FA) n −1 Pb n I 3 n −1 Cl 2 ) nucleate could form in the precursor inks. To verify this, we conducted dynamic light scattering measurements to investigate the colloidal properties of the precursor inks. As depicted in Supplementary Fig.
4 , a large colloid with particle size over 1 µm appeared in the target precursor, which may be the prenucleation cluster caused by AI + . Therefore, we can infer that AI +
can preferentially react with PbI 2
to form a 2D perovskite crystallite in the precursor solution. The precrystallized 2D crystallites will sediment at the bottom interface, act as a seed crystal and provide nucleation sites for manipulating the crystallization of 3D perovskite crystals, which contributes to improved film quality (Supplementary Note
1
and Supplementary Fig.
5 ). Therefore, it is speculated that the 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction should be successfully constructed at the bottom interface by incorporating well-designed AICl into the precursor ink. In comparison to the control perovskite film, the target film showed an improved morphology with larger sized grain domain (Supplementary Fig.
6 ). As a result of the improved morphology, the carrier mobility was increased from 17 cm 2  V −1  s −1
to 28 cm 2  V −1  s −1
after modification (Supplementary Fig.
7 ). It is worth noting that the charge-carrier mobility could be reduced slightly with increase of excitation intensity, and charge-carrier lifetime was also reduced due to the increase in bimolecular recombination losses 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 . The photoluminescence and UV–visible absorption spectra show that the band gap and light-harvesting properties of the target perovskite film with the addition of AICl were unchanged (Supplementary Fig.
8 ). Next, we investigated the vertical distribution and form of existence of AICl salts in the perovskite films. Time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) measurements show that the 2D spacer species (AI +
and Cl − ) were accumulated at the perovskite/HTL interface in the target sample (Fig.
1a
and Supplementary Fig.
9 ). We performed 2D grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) to further investigate the formation of 2D perovskite at the bottom interface (Fig.
1b ). As expected, the 2D perovskite signal can only be detected with high incidence angle, which indicates that 2D perovskite was mainly formed at the bottom of 3D perovskite films. The target films exhibited diffraction
q z
peaks at ~0.3 to ~0.4 A −1 , indicating the formation of 2D perovskite crystals. We also investigated the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the target films by measuring from the front and back direction. As shown in Fig.
1c , the emission peaks at ~640 nm of 2D perovskites can only be detected from the back side, which demonstrates that the 2D perovskites were only formed at the bottom interface in the target films. These emission peaks were redshifted with respect to the dominant emission peak at ~492 nm of
n  = 1 2D perovskite ((AI) 2 PbI 2 Cl 2 ) (Supplementary Fig.
10 ). From these data we inferred that 2D perovskites ( n  ≥ 2) were formed at the 3D perovskite GBs at the buried interface, which was further supported by the theoretical calculations (Supplementary Fig.
11
and Supplementary Note
2 ). The cross-section of the target device was characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS; Supplementary Fig.
12 ). Cryogenic focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) was used to prepare the TEM specimen without damaging the inherent structures of the perovskite layer 42 . As shown in Fig.
1d
and Supplementary Fig.
13 , a thin layer of 2D perovskites ((AI) 2 (FA) n −1 Pb n I 3 n −1 Cl 2 ) could be clearly discerned at the GBs of the 3D perovskite layer at the buried interface, which is consistent with the TOF-SIMS, PL and GIWAXS results. Meanwhile, the formation of this unique 2D/3D heterojunction is independent of the types of substrate (Supplementary Fig.
14 ). In a word, the addition of a small amount of AICl into the perovskite precursor solution resulted in spontaneous formation of a bottom-up 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction at the buried interface, as illustrated in Fig.
1e . Fig. 1: Structural characterizations of the bottom-up 2D/3D heterojunction at the buried interface. a , TOF-SIMS profile of ITO/NiO x /PTAA/Al 2 O 3 /perovskite with bottom-up 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction at buried interface (2D spacer species: CN −

e , Device configuration of the inverted PSCs with bottom-up 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction at the buried interface. Full size image Investigation of interfacial carrier dynamics We next investigated the effect of the bottom-up 2D/3D heterojunction at the buried interface on the charge-carrier transport and recombination in the perovskite layer. The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of the control and target perovskite films deposited on the glass substrates are shown in Fig.
2a . According to previous reports, the rapid decay of the first stage is determined by the initial hole transfer and carrier capture, and the decay of the second stage is only related to non-radiative recombination 43 , 44 . To simulate the TRPL data, we used the kinetic model described in our previous study 5 . From the simulations, we find that the carrier lifetime of perovskite films was increased from 762 ns ( k 1  = 6.6 × 10 5  s −1 ) to 1,119 ns ( k 1  = 4.5 × 10 5  s −1 ) after addition of AICl, indicating reduced defect density in the modified perovskite films. Additionally, the space charge-limited current measurements (Supplementary Fig.
15 ) further confirmed the decreased defect density through the addition of the AI +
2D spacer. The reduced defect density should be responsible for increased carrier lifetimes and carrier mobility, which resulted in inhibited trap-assisted non-radiative recombination. Fig. 2: Charge-carrier dynamics. a , b , TRPL spectra of the control and target perovskite films deposited on a bare glass substrate ( a ) and glass/NiO x /PTAA/Al 2 O 3
substrate ( b ). TRPL measurements were conducted with excitation from the glass side and with an emission wavelength of 810 nm. The solid line shows the fitting curves. To simulate the TRPL data, we used a model based on the continuity equation for the carrier concentration
n ( z ,  t ):
\(\frac{\partial n}{\partial t}\,=\,D\,\frac{{\partial }^{2}n}{{\partial z}^{2}}\,-\,{k}_{1}\,n\,-\,{k}_{2}\,{n}^{2}-{k}_{3}\,{n}^{3}\) , where

Methods . Norm Δ R , normalized change in reflection. Full size image We then deposited perovskite films on NiO x /glass substrate and used the quenched
τ 1
lifetimes to compare charge extraction (Fig.
2b ). The quenched
τ 1
lifetime of the control film was 64.5 ns. After constructing the bottom-up 2D/3D heterojunction at the buried interface, the quenched
τ 1
lifetime of the target film was reduced to 29.4 ns, implying considerably improved charge extraction. Fits to the TRPL transients were used to compute the differential lifetime using the model of Krogmeier et al. 45
(Supplementary Fig.
16 ). The charge-transfer process at early times (~100 ns) led to a faster rise of differential lifetime in the target film than the control film. The occurrence of non-radiative first-order recombination is marked by a transition from an increasing carrier lifetime to a flat period, implying a fundamental end of charge transfer. To quantify how the TRPL lifetime is related to surface carrier extraction, we further investigated these films using transient reflection spectroscopy (TRS), from which carrier diffusivity ( D ) and surface extraction velocity (SEV) could be extracted 46 , 47 , 48 . Figure
2c,d
illustrates the surface carrier kinetics measured with transient reflection excited with three different pump pulses (2.50 eV, 2.10 eV and 1.65 eV). By simultaneously fitting the decay of charge carriers with a kinetics model (details of fits are shown in the
Methods ) that includes both diffusion and surface recombination, best-fit values of
D
and SEV were obtained (Supplementary Table
1 ). In our modelling,
D
represents the charge diffusivity and, as in thin films, both electrons and holes will diffuse together in a pair and we model them as an ambipolar diffusion constant. On the other hand, SEV only represents hole extraction velocity. For the control perovskite film, the extracted
D
and SEV values were 1.88 ± 0.10 cm 2  s −1
and 3,600 ± 500 m s −1 , respectively. The target sample exhibited improved
D
(1.94 ± 0.11 cm 2  s −1 ) and SEV (4,100 ± 400 m s −1 ) values, indicating that the hole extraction was facilitated by inserting our bottom-up 2D/3D heterojunction at the perovskite/HTL interface, which is consistent with the computed differential lifetimes. Certainly, improved morphology is also one of the important reasons for boosted carrier diffusivity, which contributed to enhanced carrier mobility. The energy level diagram in Supplementary Fig.
17
manifests that the cascade energy band alignment was formed because the valance band maximum (VBM) of 2D perovskite was located between the VBM of HTL and the VBM of 3D perovskite, which should be primarily responsible for improved hole extraction and collection, as confirmed by TRPL, TRS and transient photocurrent results. In short, the formed bottom-up 2D/3D heterojunction can promote hole extraction and suppress interfacial non-radiative recombination, which could account for the increased photovoltaic performance. Photovoltaic performance and long-term stability Next, we fabricated inverted PSCs with a structure of ITO/NiO x /PTAA/Al 2 O 3 /Cs 0.05 FA 0.95 PbI 3 /PCBM/BCP/Ag. The optimal concentration of AICl was determined by comparing the device photovoltaic performance (Supplementary Fig.
18 ). The relevant devices made from the addition of 1.5 mg ml −1
AICl are hereafter denoted as ‘target’. The average PCE value was increased from 21.94 ± 0.70% for the control device to 24.58 ± 0.35% for the target device with AICl additive (Fig.
3a ), mainly due to the increases in open-circuit voltage ( V oc ) from 1.122 ± 0.011 to 1.156 ± 0.010 V, short-circuit current density ( J sc ) from 25.36 ± 0.40 to 26.23 ± 0.20 mA cm −2
and fill factor (FF) from 77.73 ± 1.88% to 81.06 ± 0.89% (Supplementary Fig.
19
and Supplementary Table
2 ). We attained a PCE of 25.12% for the best-performing target device ( J sc
of 26.22 mA cm −2 ,
V oc
of 1.165 V and FF of 82.2%), along with negligible hysteresis and a stabilized PCE of 25.05% (Fig.
3b
and Supplementary Fig.
20 ). One of the best-performing devices was validated by an independent solar cell accredited laboratory (National Photovoltaic Product Quality Inspection and Testing Center, China) for certification, where a PCE of 24.60% (with
J sc  = 25.69 mA cm −2 ,
V oc  = 1.173 V and FF = 81.63%) was confirmed (Supplementary Fig.
21 ), which is higher than the values reported for all inverted PSCs based on MA-free perovskite reported to date (Fig.
3c
and Supplementary Table
3 ). Corresponding external quantum efficiency spectra (Supplementary Fig.
22 ) yielded an integrated
J sc
of 24.88 mA cm −2
for the target device and 23.92 mA cm −2
for the control device, which was just slightly lower than the values obtained from
J–V
measurements. The addition of AICl thus showed a marked improvement in PCE, which is associated with an enhanced
V oc
and FF, as well as
J sc . The Mott–Schottky plots demonstrated a higher flat-band potential for the target device compared with the control device (Supplementary Fig.
23 ), which is directly related to an increase in
V oc . Moreover, we found that the target device has a smaller ideality factor ( n id ) than the control device (Supplementary Fig.
24 ), indicating the improved interfacial charge transfer/transport and suppressed non-radiative recombination channels, which accounts for the enhanced
V oc
and FF. The increase in
J sc
is ascribed to improved interfacial energy band alignment and thus charge extraction due to the formation of stepped band alignment induced by the bottom-up 2D/3D heterojunction at the perovskite/HTL interface 49 . The addition of AICl also contributed to the improved uniformity of the large-area perovskite films with less density of defects. As a result, in comparison to the control devices, the large-area target device with aperture area of 1.0 cm 2
showed better performance (Fig.
3d
and Supplementary Fig.
25 ). A champion PCE of 22.48% was obtained for the large-area target device, which is also the highest value among all large-area inverted PSCs reported so far (Supplementary Table
4 ). Furthermore, AICl additive is universal for various perovskite compositions, as demonstrated by the systematic absolute PCE enhancement of 1.2 to 2.6% for device performance (Supplementary Figs.
26
and
27
and Supplementary Table
2 ). Fig. 3: Device performance and stability. a , PCE histogram of 20 PSCs with (target) and without (control) bottom-up 2D/3D heterojunction at buried interface. The solid line is a Gauss peak fit of the distribution.

e , PCE of the unencapsulated control and target devices measured at maximum power point under continuous one-sun illumination at 55 ± 5 °C in N 2
atmosphere. The initial PCE of control, target-1 and target-2 devices is 21.73%, 24.42% and 24.11%, respectively.
f , Damp-heat stability of the encapsulated control and target devices following the ISOS standards (85 °C and 85% RH). The initial PCE of control and target devices is 22.15 ± 0.13% and 24.32 ± 0.20%. The error bar is the standard deviation of three devices. Data are presented as mean values ± s.e.m. Source data Full size image As a comparison, we also predeposited different amounts of AICl salts on the indium tin oxide (ITO)/HTL substrates before 3D perovskite formation (Supplementary Fig.
28 ), which is expected to form bottom-up 2D/3D heterojunctions according to previous reports 16 , 27 . As shown in Supplementary Fig.
29a , it is clear that a 2D perovskite layer was formed at the bottom of the 3D perovskite film. However, the fabricated inverted PSCs with the bottom-up 2D/3D perovskite films show poor photovoltaic performance compared to the control device (Supplementary Fig.
29b ). These results further prove the advantages of our strategy of incorporating the 2D perovskite spacer into precursor inks. Finally, we evaluated the stability of the high-efficiency inverted PSCs under accelerated ageing conditions according to the International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS) protocols 50 . The long-term operational stability of the unencapsulated control and target PSCs was evaluated by MPP tracking under constant simulated AM1.5 illumination (100 mW cm −2 ). Both the target devices maintained over 98% of their initial PCE of >24% after 1,500 hours of continuous tests at 55 ± 5 °C, whereas the control device degraded to 78% of its initial PCE of 21.73% (Fig.
3e ). Additionally, we conducted damp-heat measurements for the encapsulated devices at 85 °C in the 85% relative humidity-controlled chamber. As shown in Fig.
3f , the target device exhibited a
T 90
(the time over which the device efficiency reduces to 90%) of >1,000 hours under the heating stress and thus successfully passed the main point of ISOS qualification for thermally accelerated ageing conditions (ISOS-T-1). The enhanced thermal and operational stability can be attributed to a lower concentration of defects and the suppressed ion migration at the HTL/perovskite interface caused by the construction of the bottom-up 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction 6 , 7 . Taken together, these data indicate that inverted PSCs with tailored bottom-up 2D/3D heterojunction at the buried interface exhibited excellent efficiency and stability, and this work takes an important step towards the realization of commercial perovskite-based single- and multiple-junction solar cells. Methods Materials All chemicals and solvents were used as received without further purification.

PTAA (molecular weight distribution: 6,000–15,000) and bathocuproine (BCP) were purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology. 2-Aminoindane hydrochloride (AICl, 98%) was bought from Macklin. NiO x
nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized according to previous work 51 . Device fabrication ITO-coated glass substrates were etched by laser. The etched ITO glass was ultrasonically cleaned for 15 min using detergent, deionized water (twice) and ethanol (twice), sequentially. ITO-coated glass substrates were treated by ultraviolet ozone (UVO) for 30 min. Then, the 25 mg ml −1
NiO x
NP aqueous ink was prepared by dispersing as-prepared NiO x
NPs into deionized water and then spin-coating onto ITO glass at 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. The NiO x
films were annealed at 150 °C for 10 min under ambient conditions. Then, the obtained NiO x
films were immediately transferred into a nitrogen-filled glovebox. PTAA solution (1 mg ml −1 ) in CB was spin-coated onto NiO x
films at 6,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. After that, Al 2 O 3
dispersion solution (0.4 wt% in IPA) was spin-coated onto PTAA films at 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. Perovskite films with different compositions were deposited by the spin-coating method (details presented below). Subsequently, the 23 mg ml −1
of PC 61 BM solution in CB was spin-coated onto the perovskite films at 2,500 r.p.m. for 40 s. Then, 5 mg BCP was added into 1 mL IPA and shaken for 5 min to prepare a supersaturated solution, which was filtered using a PTFE filter before use. Afterwards, the obtained saturated solution was spin-coated on PC 61 BM film at 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. Finally, a 100 nm Ag electrode with an active area of 0.11 cm 2
and 1.10 cm 2
was deposited by thermal evaporation for small-area and large-area devices, respectively. For FA 0.95 Cs 0.05 PbI 3
perovskite films, 1.4 M perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 228.4 mg FAI, 18.2 mg CsI and 645.4 mg PbI 2
and AICl (0, 1, 1.5, 2 and 3 mg ml −1 ) in mixed solvents of DMF and DMSO (v/v, 4/1). The perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated on glass/ITO/NiO x /PTAA/Al 2 O 3
substrate at 2,000 r.p.m. for 10 s and then at 4,000 r.p.m. for 40 s. During the second spin-coating step, 150 µl CB was dropped onto the perovskite film at 5 s before the end of the programme. The resultant wet perovskite films were annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. For (FA 0.85 MA 0.15 ) 0.95 Cs 0.05 Pb(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3
triple-cation perovskite films, 1.5 M perovskite precursor solution was prepared by mixing CsI, FAI, MABr, PbI 2 , PbBr 2
and AICl (0, 1, 1.5, 2 and 3 mg ml −1 ) in 1 ml mixed solvents of DMF:DMSO (v/v, 5/1), where excess 10 mol% of PbI 2
was added to improve the device performance. A 60 μl perovskite solution was spin-coated onto glass/ITO/NiO x /PTAA/Al 2 O 3
substrate at 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. A 250 μl portion of CB was slowly dripped onto the centre of the film at 7 s before the end of spin-coating. The as-prepared perovskite films were subsequently annealed on a hotplate at 110 °C for 60 min. For MAPbI 3
perovskite films, the perovskite precursor solution was prepared by mixing 1.55 M MAI and 1.63 M PbI 2
in 1 ml mixed solvents of DMF:DMSO (5/1, v/v), and stirring for 2 h before use. A 40 μl portion of perovskite solution was spin-coated onto glass/ITO/NiO x /PTAA/Al 2 O 3
substrate at 2,000 r.p.m. for 10 s and at 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. A 200 μl portion of CB was rapidly dripped onto the centre of the film at 5 s before the end of spin-coating. The as-prepared perovskite films were subsequently annealed on a hotplate at 100 °C for 60 min. Characterization of the solar cells The current density–voltage ( J–V ) characteristics of the devices were measured in ambient air (relative humidity was 40–50%) using an AM 1.5G solar simulator equipped with 450 W xenon lamp (Newport-2612A) and a Keithley 2400 SourceMeter. Light intensity was adjusted to AM 1.5G one sun (100 mW cm −2 ) with an NIM calibrated standard Si solar cell.
J–V
curves were measured in forward scan (from −0.1 to 1.2 V) and reverse scan (from 1.2 to −0.1 V). The active area of cells was defined to be 0.09 cm 2
or 1 cm 2
by a black metal mask. For incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency measurement, a Newport Instruments system (Newport-74125) coupled with a lock-in amplifier and a 300 W xenon lamp was employed. Characterization of the device stability The operational stability measurement of the unencapsulated devices was conducted under a continuous one-sun illumination (a light-emitting diode (LED) lamp without UV filter) at 55 ± 5 °C at MPP by using a MPP trace system (YH-VMPP-16) in a N 2 -filled glovebox for 1,500 h. According to the ISOS-T-1 standard, the stability measurement of the encapsulated devices was conducted at 85 °C and 85% RH in the constant temperature and humidity test chamber (HS-408L) for 1,200 h. The devices were encapsulated by UV adhesive (LT-U001, Lumtec) and a glass on top. As for
J–V
characterization, the PSCs were cooled to room temperature and measured by a Newport solar simulator (100 mW cm −2 ; 94023 A Oriel Sol3A, Class AAA) at AM 1.5G (calibrated via a standard silicon cell (Hamamatsu S1133)) and a Keithley 2420 SourceMeter (scan rate was 0.1 V s −1 ) at different time intervals. The devices used for damp-heat stability test were encapsulated. The devices were encapsulated in an N 2
atmosphere via a top glass and edge encapsulation of UV adhesive (LT-U001, Lumtec). The light spectrum of the LED lamp (Kaiyingerdun, 50 W, 5,000 K) and xenon lamp (Newport 94023A Oriel Sol3A, Class AAA) were used for MPP tracking and damp-heat stability tests, respectively (Supplementary Fig.
30 ). The top glass on the device was fixed by a tweezer and aligned with the edge of the device. Then, about 200 μl of UV adhesive was applied at the edge gap between the glass and the device. Finally, the UV adhesive was solidified by a UV curing process (XY2008-GHX-1) for 2 min. Scanning electron microscopy Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (JEOL JSM-7800F) was employed to characterize the cross-sectional and surface morphology of perovskite films. X-ray diffraction and UV–visible measurements The X-ray diffraction patterns were acquired using a Panalytical Empyrean diffractometer equipped with CuKα radiation ( λ  = 1.5406 Å). The UV–visible absorption spectra of perovskite films were measured using a Shimadzu UV3600 spectrophotometer. The change of light absorption during spin-coating of perovskite film was studied using self-made in situ light absorption equipment. Mott–Schottky measurements Mott–Schottky measurements (1,000 Hz) were carried out on a Chenhua electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E) under dark conditions. Photoluminescence measurements The steady-state PL spectra and TRPL spectra were measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (FLS1000, Edinburgh Instruments) with the excitation with a 405 nm laser pulsed at a frequency of 1 MHz and 500 KHz, respectively. Cryo-focused ion beam specimen preparation and STEM–EDS measurements The scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) specimen preparations were performed on an FEI Helios 5 dual-beam microscope equipped with a cryogenic system 42 . The bulk sample was placed on the cryo-stage and gradually cooled to about −140 °C by supplying liquid N 2 . After curing the organometallic precursor to form a Pt-C protective layer, a prism-shaped specimen was cut and transferred to a TEM grid. The subsequent sectioning was by fine milling and specimen transfer processes. The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF–STEM), EDS mapping and integrated differential phase contrast (iDPC)-STEM measurements were performed on a double Cs-corrected electron microscope (FEI Spectra 300) operated at 300 kV. The convergence semi-angle in the iDPC-STEM was 10.0 mrad. The probe current was about 1 pA. The dwell time was 5 µs per pixel, and the collection angle was 4–15 mrad. EDS analysis was performed using the high-efficient ‘Super X’ four-detector EDS detector. TOF-SIMS measurements The TOF-SIMS measurements (TOF-SIMS 5, IONTOF) were performed with the pulsed primary ions from an oxygen-ion beam (1 keV) for sputtering and a Bi +
pulsed primary ion beam for analysis (25 keV). GIWAXS measurements The GIWAXS data were obtained from BL1W1A of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility. UV photoelectron spectroscopy measurements UV photoelectron spectra were measured (Thermo Fisher Escalab 250Xi spectrometer) using a monochromatized Al source. The UV photoelectron spectra were calibrated using the work function of Au. TRS measurements TRS measurements were performed by a pump-probe spectrometer (TA-100, Time-Tech Spectra). A Ti:sapphire amplifier (Astrella, Coherent) was used to generate 800 nm light at 1 kHz repetition rate. The fundamental pulse was split into two parts. One part was sent to an optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS, light conversion) for the generation of various pump wavelengths at 1.65 eV, 2.1 eV and 2.6 eV. The pump was chopped at a frequency of 500 Hz and attenuated by neutral density filter wheels. The other part of the fundamental pulse was focused into a sapphire crystal to generate a visible continuum (450–810 nm) that was used as the probe. The probe pulses were delayed in time with respect to the pump pulses using a motorized translation stage mounted with a retroreflecting mirror. The pump and probe were spatially overlapped on the surface of the sample. For transient reflectance measurement, the incident angle for the pump was around 0° and for the probe was around 45°. The initial carrier density was of the order of 10 16  cm −3 . For transient reflection kinetics, the measured surface carrier kinetics can be modelled with a diffusion and surface recombination/transfer model. The carriers are generated with the profile $$\,N(x,0)={N}_{0}{\mathrm{e}}^{-\alpha x}\,$$
(1)
where
N 0
is the initial surface carrier density. If the traces are normalized, then
N 0
is equal to 1. The values for the absorption coefficient at different pump-photon energies for samples are known. The carrier movement obeys the diffusion and surface recombination/transfer equation: $$\frac{\partial N(x,t)}{\partial t}=D\frac{{\partial }^{2}N(x,t)}{\partial {x}^{2}}-\frac{N\left(x,t\right)}{{\tau }_{\mathrm{B}}}$$

where
N ( x ,  t ) is the carrier density as a function of depth ( x ) and time ( t ),
D
is the ambipolar diffusion coefficient and
τ B
is the bulk carrier lifetime. Generally, in perovskite material,
τ B
is of the order of hundreds of ns, and in the 5,000 ps probe window it can be neglected. The boundary condition can be described as follows. For the front surface, surface recombination/transfer will dominate ( S F ). For the back surface, surface recombination/transfer happens with
S L . For pure perovskites, the back surface and front surface can be assumed to have the same surface recombination velocity. For samples with HTL, the front surface transfer velocity is different from the back, where the back ( S L ) takes the value of pure perovskites.
L
is the thickness of the film. Time-resolved microwave conductivity measurements For time-resolved microwave conductivity measurements, the perovskite film samples were deposited on glass and excited with a fast nanosecond laser pulse (LO-TIS TII Nd:YAG Laser System LS-2145-OPO), which generated a certain amount of carriers within the sample. Subsequently, we probed the samples with a microwave and the reflected microwave intensity was monitored as a function of time following photo-excitation with a microwave analyser (N9915A FieldFox, Keysight). To enhance the sensitivity, we introduced a high-Q microwave cavity, which has a resonance frequency of ~4.3 GHz. The source power of the microwave was set at 1 mW, and the excitation laser wavelength was 530 nm with a pulse length of ~5 ns, repetition rate of 10 Hz and excitation fluence of ~0.3–30 µJ cm −2 , corresponding to a carrier density of 7.5 × 10 15 –7.5 × 10 17  cm −3 . Computational methods We used the open source code cp2k 52
to perform the density functional theory-based geometry optimization, Multiwfn was used to assist with the input file generation 53
and the PBE-D3 functional was used with double-zeta basis sets (DZVP-MOLOPT) and Goedecker–Teter–Hutter pseudopotentials 54
with an energy cutoff of 400 Ry. Local minimum-energy geometry was obtained until the total force was less than 4.5 × 10 −4  Ry. As a large enough simulation box was used, a single gamma point was chosen for all the calculations. The formation of the 2D perovskite was divided into three stages, namely: (1) formation of (FA) n −1 Pb n I 3 n −1
perovskite flakes by dissolved PbI 2
and FAI at the surface; (2) formation of ligand-assisted 2D perovskite L 2 (FA) n −1 Pb n I 3 n −1
(it should be noted that the ligand we used here was C 9 H 11 N · HCl; however, it is widely accepted that the Cl atom will not be incorporated into the crystal lattice but helps the perovskite crystallization in the intermediate compound, thus the C 9 H 11 N · HI iodine salt was used for calculation instead); (3) bulk 2D perovskite formation by way of stacking in the
z
direction via the van der Waals interactions. The formation energy of the three stages is illustrated in Supplementary Fig.
8a
and is defined as: $${{E}}_{{\rm{form}}}[{\rm{stage}}\,1]={E}[{{\rm{FA}}}_{{n}-1}{{\rm{Pb}}}_{{n}}{{\rm{I}}}_{{3n}-1}]-({n}-1){E}[{\rm{FAI}}]-{nE}[{{\rm{PbI}}}_{2}]$$ $${{E}}_{{\rm{form}}}[{\rm{stage}}\,2]={E}[{{\rm{L}}}_{2}{{\rm{FA}}}_{{n}-1}{{\rm{Pb}}}_{{n}}{{\rm{I}}}_{{3n}+1}]-{E}[{{\rm{FA}}}_{{n}-1}{{\rm{Pb}}}_{{n}}{{\rm{I}}}_{{3n}-1}]-{2E}[{\rm{LI}}]$$ $${{E}}_{{\rm{form}}}[{\rm{stage}}\,3]={E}[{\rm{bulk}}:\,{{\rm{L}}}_{2}{{\rm{FA}}}_{{n}-1}{{\rm{Pb}}}_{{n}}{{\rm{I}}}_{{3n}+1}]-{E}[{\rm{slab}}:\,{{\rm{L}}}_{2}{{\rm{FA}}}_{{n}-1}{{\rm{Pb}}}_{{n}}{{\rm{I}}}_{{3n}+1}]$$ The formation energy of each stage was calculated to investigate the 2D perovskite formation, and given that stage 3 should be the same for different numbers of layer
n , we ignored it. Supplementary Fig.
8b
shows the formation energy for different numbers of layer
n , and it was found that the formation energy of
n  = 2, 3, 4 and 5 was negative and decreases monotonically, which indicates that the energy is favourable to form the FA n −1 Pb n I 3 n −1
perovskite flakes. In contrast, the formation energy of
n  = 1 is positive, which means that it is difficult to form due to the non-favourable positive energy value. Therefore, in our case, the low-dimensional perovskites are easier to form for
n  ≥ 2 compared to
n  = 1. Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the

Abstract Improving the intrinsic film quality of metal halide perovskites is very critical to increase the power conversion efficiency and long-term stability of perovskite solar cells. Here we report a multifunctional, non-volatile additive that can be used to modulate the kinetics of perovskite film growth through a hydrogen-bond-bridged intermediate phase. The additive enables the formation of large perovskite grains and coherent grain growth from bottom to the surface of the film. The enhanced film morphology results in significantly reduced non-radiative recombinations, thus boosting the power conversion efficiency of inverted (p–i–n) solar cells to 24.8% (24.5% certified) with a low energy loss of 0.36 eV. The unencapsulated devices exhibit improved thermal stability with a
T 98
lifetime beyond 1,000 h under continuous heating at 65 ± 5 °C in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. This effective approach can also be applied to wide-bandgap perovskites and large-area devices to show reduced voltage loss and high efficiency.

Main Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have garnered great attention due to their impressive optoelectronic properties 1 . Combining compositional and interfacial engineering strategies, the record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) has now reached 25.7% (ref.
2 ) ( https://www.nrel.gov/pv/cell-efficiency.html ). However, the reported high-efficiency devices mostly comprise the conventional (n–i–p) architecture 3 , 4 , 5 , whereas inverted (p–i–n) PVSCs still show inferior performance despite their low-temperature processability and better compatibility in fabricating tandem and flexible devices 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 . The major challenge stems from the severe energy loss in inverted PVSCs, especially the non-radiative recombination loss associated with defects embedded at the interfaces and grain boundaries 11 . A high-quality perovskite film with intrinsically low defect density is, thus, critical in determining the achievable efficiency and stability for PVSCs 12 . In a typical one-step solution process, perovskite precursors dissolved in polar aprotic solvents are spin coated onto the substrate. The introduction of an antisolvent then quickly extracts the residual solvents and templates the perovskite crystal growth through intermediate phases 13 . Various volatile solvents and organic salts have been employed as additives to tune the intermediate compositions for modulating the crystallization kinetics 14 , 15 , 16 . In one work,
N -methyl-2-pyrrolidone was added in the perovskite precursors to form a lead iodide (PbI 2 )– N -methyl-2-pyrrolidone adduct for promoting the black-phase formation at room temperature 15 . In another work, methylammonium chloride (MACl) was used to facilitate the formation of an intermediate phase for stabilizing the perovskite α-phase 16 . However, these additives may volatilize during annealing, creating voids at the perovskite–substrate interface, inducing unavoidable recombination loss and fast degradation of the perovskite 17 . Here we report the formation of a hydrogen-bond-bridged intermediate by adding a multifunctional molecule (4-guanidinobenzoic acid hydrochloride (GBAC)) into the perovskite precursor to modulate the crystallization kinetics and serve as an effective non-volatile passivation linker in the annealed film. Combining crystallography, in situ photoluminescence (PL) characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we reveal that the crystal growth kinetics is regulated by additional energies required for hydrogen-bond breakage and cation exchange between the intermediate phase and perovskite. Therefore, the obtained perovskite films exhibit significantly enhanced crystallinity with larger grains. Besides, the additives can form tight packs at the grain boundaries due to π–π interaction of the aryls to effectively passivate the defects in perovskites. The derived inverted PVSCs achieved a champion PCE of 24.8% with an open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 1.19 V, short-circuit current density ( J SC ) of 24.55 mA cm –2
and fill factor (FF) of 84.78%. A certified PCE of 24.5% was obtained from the Japan Electrical Safety & Environment Technology Laboratories, being among the highest reported for inverted PVSCs (Supplementary Table
1 ). We also applied this strategy to fabricate wide-bandgap and large-area PVSCs, paving the way for developing multijunction and scalable perovskite photovoltaics. Characterization of perovskite films We introduced GBAC as an additive into the perovskite precursor solution, which can interact with the uncoordinated lead and organic–inorganic vacancies via Lewis acid–base reactions with the carboxyl and guanidium groups 18 . To verify our hypothesis, we first conducted Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry to study the interactions between GBAC and organic species in perovskites. As shown in Fig.
1a
and Supplementary Fig.
1 , the N–H stretching peak shifted from 3,352 to 3,378 cm −1
for FA + /MA +
and the C=N stretching peak in FA +
also shifted from 1,713 to 1,709 cm −1
on adding GBAC, suggesting the formation of hydrogen bonds between GBAC and organic cations 19 . These indicate that the interplay between GBAC and FA + /MA +
in the perovskite can help strengthen the film stability, especially thermal stability that is mainly governed by the organic species. We then verified this through a thermogravimetric analysis (Supplementary Fig.
2 ), where the impeded decomposition of the target film suggests that more energy is required to disrupt the interaction between GBAC and perovskite 20 , ameliorating the film’s thermal stability.

f , Statistical distribution of surface potential extracted from the KPFM images. Full size image We performed high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) to study the surface chemistry of perovskites (Supplementary Fig.
3 ). We clearly observed the peak corresponding to GBAC π–π interaction (293.10 eV, C1 s
spectrum) and increased the C=O peak area (O1 s
spectrum) in the target film, further validating the existence of the GBAC linker in the perovskite (Supplementary Figs.
4
and
5 ). In the Pb4 f
spectrum (Fig.
1b ), the binding energy of 4 f 5/2
and 4 f 7/2
for divalent Pb 2+
shifted from 141.92 and 137.09 eV to 141.59 and 136.76 eV, respectively, due to the electrostatic interaction between the guanidium group and PbI 6 4− . We further recorded the steady-state PL and time-resolved PL profiles of perovskite films to reveal how GBAC affects the film quality and charge-transport dynamics (Supplementary Fig.
6 ). The target film exhibits six times stronger PL intensity and three times longer PL lifetime than those of the control film, agreeing well with the FTIR and XPS results that GBAC suppresses the defect-induced non-radiative recombination to reduce energy loss for improving the photovoltaic performance. To understand how GBAC addition affects the film morphology, we collected scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the perovskite films. The target film shows considerably larger grains (~1 μm) and fewer residual PbI 2
sheets than the control film (Fig.
1c,d ), with a coherent bottom-to-surface grain growth that can facilitate the transport of carriers to electrodes. Besides good film morphology, the crystallinity of the target film is significantly improved (Fig.
1e ). The decreased PbI 2
sheets in the SEM images was also confirmed by the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns, suggesting that GBAC can interact with the uncoordinated Pb 2+
and modulate film growth to obtain fully grown grains. Moreover, the addition of GBAC significantly helps modulate the crystal orientation within the film for facilitating charge transport (Supplementary Fig.
7 ). Atomic force microscopy characterization reveals a lower surface roughness after GBAC addition (Supplementary Fig.
8 ). We also applied Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) to evaluate the distribution of the surface potential of perovskite films, which shows an increment of 200–300 mV in the target film (Fig.
1f
and Supplementary Fig.
9 ), indicating a Fermi level ( E F ) closer to the conductive band edge 21 . The higher work function measured by KPFM matches well with the results obtained from ultraviolet photoelectron spectrometry (UPS), showing a 0.25 eV shift in
E F
by adding GBAC (Supplementary Fig.
10 ). The more n-characteristic film surface stems from the modified surface termination after adding GBAC (ref.
22 ), enabling more efficient charge transfer between the perovskite and electron-transporting materials (Supplementary Fig.
11 ). In situ characterization of film formation To gain more insights into the remarkably enhanced film quality, we adopted in situ PL spectrometry to understand the role of GBAC during film formation 23 , 24 , 25 . The evolution of the PL peak position in both control and target films shows similar trends in the long-term stage (0–750 s) (Supplementary Figs.
12 – 14 ). However, the initial peak position of the wet target film was slightly blueshifted compared with that of the control film due to the additional chloride from GBAC (Fig.
2a,b ). Also, the target film exhibits a much slower shift with negligible fluctuation in the initial stage (0–10 s) compared with those of the control sample, implying that the crystallization process was significantly retarded by adding GBAC (Fig.
2b ) 23 . Moreover, the PL peaks of the target film are more symmetric compared with the control film, indicating a more uniform distribution of crystallite sizes, which facilitates the significantly increased grain sizes, as shown in the SEM images (Fig.
1c,d ) 25 . Fig. 2: Comparison of film growth kinetics by in situ PL. a , b , Normalized in situ PL peak position evolution of the control ( a ) and target ( b ) perovskite films.

a . Full size image We then analysed the evolution of PL peak intensity, which shows typical PL quenching in both films but more severe in the control film (Fig.
2c,d ) 24 , 25 . Such PL quenching originates from the continuously increased Urbäch energy, indicating the gradual formation of defects in the microstructures of perovskites 24 . However, it is considerably inhibited in the target film, showing a much lower defect density and better ambient stability than the control film (Fig.
2d ) 26 . The initial stages (0–2 s for the control sample and 0–30 s for the target sample) were then enlarged to clearly show the PL intensity evolution (Fig.
2e,f ). The control film shows a typical four-stage ‘up–down–up–down’ process with two states (Fig.
2e ) 24 . In state ‘I’ (0–200 ms), the perovskite grains grow freely and are well crystallized/ordered, resulting in an increased PL intensity (‘up’). When the solvent is almost entirely evaporated, the perovskite crystallites are exposed to the surrounding atmosphere and the surfaces of other crystallites, forming grain boundaries and triggering rapid PL quenching (‘down’; 200–400 ms). In state ‘II’, the small crystallites further grow and merge into larger ones on annealing to reduce the overall grain boundaries, resulting in an increased PL intensity again (‘up’; 400–600 ms). Such a rapid film formation can also be attributed to the absorbed moisture accumulated within the grain boundaries, inducing grain-boundary creep and subsequent merging of adjacent grains to accelerate the film growth 27 . The partial recovery of PL intensity also comes from the passivation effect of excessive PbI 2
at the perovskite grain boundaries 28 . Eventually, the film is vulnerable under ambient conditions and prone to decomposition. This results in a stabilized but almost one order of magnitude lower PL intensity than that of PL max
(‘down’; after 600 ms). However, adding GBAC introduces an extra stage involving the intermediate-induced pre-growth process in the target sample (Fig.
2f ) 24 , 25 . The film formation is significantly slowed down, reaching its maximum PL intensity at ~20 s and maintained for longer time. These results imply that adding GBAC can modulate the crystallization kinetics by forming an additional intermediate to enhance the film quality, leading to larger grain sizes and high crystallinity. Film growth with hydrogen-bond-bridged intermediate To study the GBAC-induced intermediate phase, we grew the single crystal of GBAC–PbI 2 – N , N -dimethylformamide (DMF) (Supplementary Table
2 ) 29 . We observed strong cyclic hydrogen bonds between the carboxylic acid and guanidium groups as well as DMF and guanidium groups (Fig.
3a ). The DMF molecules locked by hydrogen bonds help isolate the PbI 2
sheets and GBAC layer, leading to a one-dimensional organic–inorganic hybrid chain structure. Due to the strong dipole of GBAC and the electron delocalization in the guanidium groups (Supplementary Fig.
15 ), these hydrogen bonds are very different from the typical linear hydrogen-bonded chains that serve as supramolecular synthons for layered perovskite structures 30 . This unique interaction mode helps build a bridge to connect the organic–inorganic components. Moreover, the interaction between GBAC and perovskite precursor components in solution was investigated by
1 H nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry (Supplementary Fig.
16 ), of which the results are in good agreement with those observed from XPS and FTIR measurements 7 . Through these studies, we have identified that GBAC can simultaneously interact with the solvent, organic and inorganic components in the precursor solution through both Coulomb interaction and hydrogen bonding, demonstrating its multifunctionality in solution.

e , Schematic of the GBAC-assisted film growth. The brown arrows represent the breakage of hydrogen bonds, and the green arrows represent the cation exchange. Full size image We then conducted a thermal analysis of single crystals to study the phase transition from the intermediate state to perovskite. The experimental XRD pattern of the obtained transparent GBAC–PbI 2 –DMF crystals matches well with the XRD pattern simulated from the single-crystal structure, confirming their composition (Supplementary Fig.
17 ). The simultaneous thermal analysis profile shows an intense endothermic peak at ~80 °C corresponding to hydrogen-bond breakage (Supplementary Fig.
18 ). At elevated temperatures, DMF starts to evaporate, destabilizing the intermediate that then transforms into a new one-dimensional structure composed of GBAC–PbI 2
(Fig.
3b
and Supplementary Fig.
19 ). This GBAC–PbI 2
phase can only be identified in a perovskite film with >4 mol% GBAC dosage (Supplementary Figs.
20
and
21 ), where a small dosage of GBAC, in turn, functions as a passivation linker anchoring at the grain boundaries to reduce the defect density and enhance the film stability with its rigid stacking 8 . To understand the impact of such hydrogen-bond-bridged intermediate on film growth, periodic DFT calculations were performed to understand if GBAC +
can spontaneously exchange with FA +
during the crystallization process. Due to the substantial hydrogen bonding, the formation energy of this intermediate (GBAC–PbI 2 –DMF) (–18.58 eV) is much lower than that of δ-FAPbI 3
(–10.60 eV). Such extra stabilization is not thermodynamically favourable for crystal growth, since extra energy is required to enable the cation exchange between GBAC +
and FA +
(ref.
31 ). During the subsequent thermal annealing, the hydrogen bonds in the GBAC–PbI 2 –DMF phase were broken to form GBAC–PbI 2
with an energy of −11.85 eV (Fig.
3c ). Although this significantly reduced energy barrier (1.25 eV) is easier to overcome, it will still hinder the free exchange between GBAC +
and FA + , thereby slowing down the crystallization process 32 . In addition to thermodynamic control, the nucleation rate mediated by kinetic control can also be altered by increasing the activation energy of cation exchange 33 . Compared with the Lewis acid–base adduct formed between PbI 2
and DMF (−0.79 eV) (Fig.
3d ), the stronger ionic bonding between GBAC and PbI 2
(−1.16 eV) will cost extra energy to overcome the saddling point (Supplementary Figs.
22
and
23 ) 34 , 35 . Moreover, based on the Arrhenius equation, the inherent nucleation and growth kinetics originating from the high volatility of DMF and strong FA–precursor binding to DMF (−1.00 eV) (ref.
36 ) will also be hindered by the more stable GBAC–PbI 2
phase. Therefore, the crystal growth of the perovskite can be both thermodynamically and kinetically modulated by this hydrogen-bond-bridged intermediate (Supplementary Fig.
24 ). Due to the strong interaction between GBAC and perovskite, the retarded film formation would also accumulate GBAC at the bottom interface (Supplementary Fig.
25 ). Eventually, rigidly stacked GBAC can form at the grain boundaries due to π–π interaction after DMF evaporation, acting as a multifunctional passivation linker to enhance the photovoltaic performance (Fig.
3e ) 8 . Photovoltaic performance The inverted PVSCs with a device configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/((2,7-dimethoxy-9H-carbazol-9-yl) methyl) phosphonic acid (DC-PA) (ref.
21 )/perovskite (with/without GBAC)/C60/bathocuproine/Ag were fabricated to evaluate their photovoltaic performance (Fig.
4a , Supplementary Figs.
26
and
27
and Supplementary Table
3 ). As shown in Fig.
4b , the highest PCE of the control device is 22.8%, with
V OC
of 1.12 V,
J SC
of 24.48 mA cm –2
and FF of 83.01%. However, the champion PCE of the GBAC-treated device can be further improved to 24.8% ( V OC
of 1.19 V,
J SC
of 24.55 mA cm –2
and FF of 84.78%), which is among the highest efficiencies reported so far for inverted PVSCs. The stabilized power output of the target champion device is 24.4%, matching well with the PCEs from the
J – V
measurement (Fig.
4c ). The device performance was also validated at an independent laboratory (Japan Electrical Safety & Environment Technology Laboratories) to show a certified PCE of 24.5% ( V OC  = 1.19 V,
J SC  = 24.45 mA cm –2
and FF = 84.20%) (Supplementary Fig.
28 ). The integrated photocurrent (24.38 mA cm –2 ) from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum also matches well with the values obtained from the
J – V
measurements (Fig.
4d ). The bandgap of the perovskite is 1.55 eV, as obtained by calculating the EQE derivative (Supplementary Fig.
29 ). Benefiting from the enhanced film quality and defect passivation aided by GBAC, the average
V OC
value was boosted from 1.12 to 1.18 V (Fig.
4e ). The overall energy loss of the champion target device can be reduced to 0.36 eV, which is very close to that of GaAs photovoltaics and represents one of the lowest energy losses in high-PCE cases (Fig.
4f ) 37 , 38 . DFT calculations investigated the typical
I Pb
antisite defect on a PbI 2 -terminated surface, revealing that GBAC passivation can help reduce these deep-level charge-carrier traps (Supplementary Fig.
30 ). The trap density was reduced from 2.58 × 10 16
to 1.53 × 10 16  cm −3
after adding GBAC, further demonstrating the effectiveness of this strategy (Supplementary Fig.
31 ). Fig. 4: Characterization of photovoltaic performance and stability of PVSCs. a , Device architecture of the inverted PVSC.

Full size image Since adding GBAC can modulate crystallization to improve the film quality, this strategy can also be explored for fabricating large-area PVSCs (Supplementary Fig.
32 ). As shown in Fig.
4g , a large-area device (1.008 cm 2 ) delivered a PCE of 22.7% ( V OC  = 1.18 V,
J SC  = 24.83 mA cm –2 , FF = 77.43%), which is also one of the highest efficiencies reported for similar-sized PVSCs (Supplementary Table
4 ). Besides, the
V OC
and
J SC
values of this device are comparable with those obtained in small-area devices, showing great promise for device upscaling (Supplementary Fig.
33
and Supplementary Table
5 ). To demonstrate the general applicability of this approach to different perovskite compositions, we also fabricated devices based on a larger-bandgap perovskite (1.78 eV). The average PCE showed an increase from 15.70% to 16.61%, with average
V OC
improvement from 1.19 to 1.25 V, which is highly favourable for fabricating tandem photovoltaics (Supplementary Fig.
34 ). Finally, we investigated the stability of devices under an accelerated aging condition based on the recognized protocols 39 . Unencapsulated devices were aged under continuous heating at 65 ± 5 °C (under N 2 ). The target device showed a very small PCE decay (<3%) after 1,200 h, whereas that of the control device decreased nearly 30% during the same period (Fig.
4h ). This shows that the interaction between GBAC and organic components (MA/FA) helps strengthen the film to avoid severe decomposition and sublimation under heating (Supplementary Fig.
35 ). The long-term operational stability of the unencapsulated devices was also measured by tracking the true maximum power point under continuous one-sun illumination (Supplementary Fig.
36 ) in a N 2 -filled glovebox. The target device maintained ~90% of its initial PCE after 500 h, whereas that of the control device decreased to ~30% of its original value (Supplementary Fig.
37 ). We also performed time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) measurements to probe the compositional changes and ion migration related to device degradation. The control devices show dramatic changes with ions migrated to the perovskite/ETL interface after aging (Supplementary Fig.
38 ). However, only negligible changes were observed in the target sample aged under the same condition. Such improved device stability can be attributed to the enhanced film morphology and inhibited ion migration by adding GBAC. If GBAC can be used in conjunction with more efficient encapsulation techniques and optimal perovskite compositions, further improved PVSC efficiency and stability can be expected to meet the requirements for practical applications 40 , 41 , 42 . Conclusion In summary, we report an innovative strategy for achieving high-quality and stable perovskite films by employing a multifunctional, non-volatile additive, GBAC, which forms a unique hydrogen-bond-bridged intermediate phase to modulate the perovskite crystallization process and simultaneously functions as an efficient passivation linker. We experimentally and theoretically unveil the mechanism of GBAC in assisting perovskite film formation, providing a design guideline for selecting suitable non-volatile additives to enhance the film quality. The greatly ameliorated optoelectronic properties are attributed to improved film morphology and crystallinity, effective defect passivation and more efficient charge transfer at the more n-characteristic film surface. Consequently, an impressive PCE of 24.8% (24.5% certified), low energy loss (0.36 eV) and remarkable device stability were achieved in inverted PVSCs. Our approach can also be extended to fabricate wide-bandgap perovskite devices and upscale devices, providing a simple and effective way towards fabricating scalable and highly efficient PVSCs. Methods Materials All the materials are used as received without further purification, including DMF (99.99%, J&K), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.70%, J&K), isopropanol (IPA, 99.50%, J&K) and chlorobenzene (CB, 99.90%, J&K). Caesium iodide, caesium bromide, methylammonium iodide, formamidinium iodide (FAI) and formamidinium bromide were bought from Dysol. PbI 2
(99.9985%) and lead bromide (>98.0000%) were bought from TCI. MACl, bathocuproine (99.9%) and C60 were bought from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology. GBAC (99%) was bought from Sigma-Aldrich. Piperazinium iodide 7
and DC-PA (ref.
21 ) were synthesized according to previous reports. Synthesis of GBAC–PbI 2 –DMF single crystals PbI 2
and GBAC (1/1 by molar, 1.0 M) were dissolved in DMF and stirred overnight at 50 °C. The turbid liquid was filtered and transferred into a 4 mL vial. The vial was then placed into a sealed bottle filled with 2 mL CB. The GBAC–PbI 2 –DMF single crystals were grown along with the slow diffusion of the vapour of the antisolvent CB into the solution. Device fabrication ITO glass (15 Ω sq –1 ; 1.5 × 1.5 cm 2
for a regular device and 2.5 × 2.5 cm 2
for a large-area device) was progressively washed by sonication with detergent (Decon 90), deionized water, acetone and IPA for 15 min. The washed ITO glass was dried in a 75 °C oven for over 12 h. Then, the cleaned ITO substrates were subjected to ultraviolet–ozone for 25 min and transformed in a N 2 -filled glovebox for film fabrication. DC-PA (2 mg mL –1
in IPA) was dynamically spin coated onto the cleaned ITO at 3,000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 15 min. The substrates were cooled down to room temperature and washed with pure IPA and then annealed at 100 °C for 5 min. Then, 1.7 M perovskite precursor solutions were constructed by mixing FAI, PbI 2 , methylammonium iodide and caesium iodide in DMF:DMSO mixed solvent (4:1 v:v) with the chemical formula Cs 0.06 MA 0.14 FA 0.80 PbI 3 . Then, 10 mol% MACl was added into the precursor solution. For the target perovskite, 0.8 mol% GBAC was added to the precursor solution, and it was ensured that it is well mixed with the precursor. Then, 50 μL of the prepared precursor solution was spin coated at 1,000 rpm for 10 s and 5,000 rpm for 30 s onto the DC-PA-based ITO substrate; 170 μL CB as the antisolvent was dripped on the film at 10 s before the end of the last procedure and then annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. After deposition of the perovskite active layer, 50 μL piperazinium iodide (0.4 mg mL –1
in IPA) solution was spin coated onto the film at 5,000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 100 °C for 5 min. For the wide-bandgap perovskite, 1.2 M precursor solution with the chemical formula Cs 0.2 FA 0.8 Pb(I 0.6 Br 0.4 ) 3
was prepared from FAI, caesium iodide, formamidinium bromide, caesium bromide, PbI 2
and lead bromide, and then dissolved in DMF:DMSO mixed solvents (4:1 v:v). Then, 5 mol% excess of PbI 2
and 5 mol% MACl were added into the precursor solution. The target perovskite with 0.5 mol% GBAC was spin coated onto the DC-PA/ITO substrates at 5,000 rpm with an accelerating speed of 1,500 rpm for 30 s. Then, 150 μL CB as the antisolvent was dripped on the film at 15 s before the ending and then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The films were then cooled down to room temperature and readied for thermal evaporation. Subsequently, 25 nm C60, 8 nm bathocuproine and 100 nm Ag electrode were sequentially evaporated under a high vacuum (<4 × 10 −6  torr). Characterizations The
1 H nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were collected on a Bruker AVANCE III HD 300 MHz spectrometer in a DMSO-d6 solution with tetramethylsilane as a reference. The morphology of the samples was recorded by an SEM instrument (Philips XL30 FEG). Steady-state PL and time-resolved PL spectrum were obtained with an FLS980 spectrofluorometer (Edinburgh) with a pulsed excitation laser of 485 nm. The XPS and UPS characterization measurements were conducted in a VG ESCALAB 220i XL surface analysis system equipped with a He-discharge lamp ( hv  = 21.22 eV) and a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray gun ( hv  = 1,486.60 eV), respectively. ToF-SIMS (ION TOF-SIMS5) data were analysed with the positive mode (Bi) under 30 keV (1.00 pA) with an area of 100 × 100 μm 2 . The sputter parameters for the device are O 2
under 1 keV (100 nA) with an area of 300 × 300 μm 2 , and the sputter parameters for the film sample is gas cluster ion beam ion gun under 10 keV (10 nA) with an area of 800 × 800 μm 2 . XRD characterization was conducted on a D2 Phaser instrument with Cu Kα (wavelength, 1.5418 Å) radiation. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering measurements were conducted using a Xeuss 2.0 SAXS/WAXS laboratory beamline with a Cu X-ray source (8.05 keV, 1.54 Å) and a Pilatus 3R 300 K detector. The incidence angle is 1.0°. In situ PL spectra were characterized with home-built equipment. An excitation laser (315 nm) was introduced to the sample through a fibre, and the PL spectra were detected by using a detector connected to an Ocean Optics USB2000. PL mapping was collected using a WITec alpha300 M+ confocal microscope. The excitation laser was a diode-pumped solid-state laser (532 nm, Cobolt Laser). The
J – V
characteristics were measured in a N 2 -filled glovebox by a Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm −2 ) irradiation using an Enlitech SS-F5 solar simulator. The light intensity was calibrated using a silicon solar cell (with a KG-2 filter) from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The device areas are 0.040 cm 2
for regular devices and 1.008 cm 2
for the large-size device, both of which are determined by metal aperture masks. A 150-nm-thick magnesium fluoride layer was deposited on the back of the glass before measurements. The EQE values were collected by an Enlitech EQE measurement system. A silicon solar cell calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory was used to obtain the AM 1.5 G solar simulator’s light intensity. The devices used for the stability test had the same structure as that for the
J – V
test. For thermal stability characterization, the devices were aged on a hotplate at 65 ± 5 °C in a N 2 -filled glovebox and cooled down to room temperature before the
J – V
test. For maximum power point tracking, the devices were tracked through the high-throughput solar-cell lifetime test system from CRYSCO with maximum power point tracking under light-emitting-diode-simulated AM 1.5 G spectrum. The light source is a superluminescent diode with a range from 400 to 1,000 nm. The superluminescent diode source is equipped with a silicon photoelectric probe to monitor the change in light intensity and automatically adjust the intensity with the control of the host. The intensity of the superluminescent diode source can be adjusted from 0.1 to 1.2 kW m –2 . The duration between the two tests is 300 s. Single-crystal analysis The single-crystal structure of GBAC–PbI 2 –DMF was resolved and refined using the Bruker SHELXTL-2016/6 software package. All the non-hydrogen atoms were anisotropically refined, and all the hydrogen atoms were refined as riding atoms. The crystal data and data collection and refinement parameters are listed in Supplementary Table
1 . Also, CCDC 2141303 contains the supplementary crystallographic data of GBAC–PbI 2 –DMF, which can be obtained free of charge from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre via
www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif . DFT calculations First-principles calculations based on DFT were performed with the Vienna ab initio simulation package 43 , using the generalized gradient approximation of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional 44
for the exchange–correlation functional. Valence–core electron interactions were treated with the projector-augmented wave method 45 . We employed Grimme’s DFT-D3 scheme to include the van der Waals interactions 45 , and dipole correction for slab calculations 46 . The cutoff energy of plane-wave expansions was set at 500 eV and the Hellmann–Feynman forces acting on atoms were converged below 0.01 eV Å −1
for all the calculations. For the calculation of binding energies (defined as
\(E_{{{{\mathrm{PbI}}}}_2 - {{{\mathrm{molecule}}}}} - E_{{{{\mathrm{PbI}}}}_2} - E_{{{{\mathrm{molecule}}}}}\) ), 1 × 1 × 1 Γ-centred
k -point grid was adopted, and the convergence criteria for the electronic wave function was 1.0 × 10 −6  eV energy difference. For geometry optimizations and energy calculations, 4 × 4 × 4 Γ-centred
k -point mesh for δ-FAPbI 3 , 2 × 4 × 2 Γ-centred
k -point mesh for GBAC–PbI 2 –DMF, 3 × 4 × 2 δ-centred
k -point mesh for GBAC–PbI 2
and 5 × 5 × 5 Γ-centred
k -point mesh for α-FAPbI 3
were used. The convergence criteria of the energy difference was set to 1.0 × 10 −5  eV. Note that the formation energy ( \(\Delta E_{{{{\mathrm{\delta }}}} \text{-} {{{\mathrm{FAPbI}}}}_3}\) ) was calculated using the equation
\({{\Delta }}E_{{{{\mathrm{\delta }}}} \text{-} {{{\mathrm{FAPbI}}}}_3} = 2E_{{{{\mathrm{\delta }}}} \text{-} {{{\mathrm{FAPbI}}}}_3} - 2E_{{{{\mathrm{PbI}}}}_2} - 4E_{{{{\mathrm{FAI}}}}}\)
for PbI 2  + FAI→δ-FAPbI 3 , where
\(E_{{{{\mathrm{\delta }}}} \text{-} {{{\mathrm{FAPbI}}}}_3}\)
is the energy of δ-FAPbI 3 ,
\(E_{{{{\mathrm{PbI}}}}_2}\)
is the energy of PbI 2
calculated from bulk PbI 2
and
E FAI
is the energy calculated from gas-phase FAI. The formation energy of bulk GBAC–PbI 2
was calculated by the equation
\({{\Delta }}E_{{{{\mathrm{GBAC}}}} - {{{\mathrm{PbI}}}}_2} = E_{{{{\mathrm{GBAC}}}} - {{{\mathrm{PbI}}}}_2} - 2E_{{{{\mathrm{PbI}}}}_2} - 4E_{{{{\mathrm{GBAC}}}}}\)
for PbI 2  + GBAC→GBAC–PbI 2 , where
E GBAC
is the energy calculated from gas-phase GBAC. The formation energy of intermediate-phase GBAC–PbI 2 –DMF was calculated with the equation
\({{\Delta }}E_{{{{\mathrm{GBAC}}}} - {{{\mathrm{PbI}}}}_2 - {{{\mathrm{DMF}}}}} = E_{{{{\mathrm{GBAC}}}} - {{{\mathrm{PbI}}}}_2 - {{{\mathrm{DMF}}}}} - 2E_{{{{\mathrm{PbI}}}}_2} - 4E_{{{{\mathrm{GBAC}}}}} - 8E_{{{{\mathrm{DMF}}}}}\)
for PbI 2  + GBAC + DMF→GBAC–PbI 2 –DMF, where
E DMF
is the energy of the DMF molecules. For slab calculations, the Brillouin zone was sampled with a 2 × 2 × 1 Γ-centred
k -point mesh, and a vacuum of at least 30 Å was used to avoid the interaction of neighbouring interfaces along the
z
direction. The electrostatic potentials ( φ ) of the interacting pairs were calculated using the Gaussian 09 package at the B3LYP/def2TZVP level with DFT-D3. The maximum
φ
( φ max ) and minimum
φ
( φ min ) values of the interacting pairs were obtained with the help of Multiwfn code 47 . The structure models were drawn with the VESTA software 48 . Some data processing was done by VASPKIT 49 . Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the

Abstract The black phase of formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI 3 ) perovskite shows huge promise as an efficient photovoltaic, but it is not favoured energetically at room temperature, meaning that the undesirable yellow phases are always present alongside it during crystallization 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . This problem has made it difficult to formulate the fast crystallization process of perovskite and develop guidelines governing the formation of black-phase FAPbI 3
(refs.
5 , 6 ). Here we use in situ monitoring of the perovskite crystallization process to report an oriented nucleation mechanism that can help to avoid the presence of undesirable phases and improve the performance of photovoltaic devices in different film-processing scenarios. The resulting device has a demonstrated power-conversion efficiency of 25.4% (certified 25.0%) and the module, which has an area of 27.83 cm 2 , has achieved an impressive certified aperture efficiency of 21.4%.

Main FAPbI 3
has an impressive bandgap and thermal resistance, and has therefore emerged as the most promising candidate perovskite for use as a photovoltaic device 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 8 . However, the photoactive black phase of FAPbI 3
is not energetically favoured at room temperature 4 , 9 , 10 . Polytype formation and the presence of other intermediate non-photoactive phases can readily occur, which undermines its photovoltaic performance. Several approaches have been developed to promote the formation of black-phase FAPbI 3
at room temperature, such as adduct formation with PbI 2
and solvent engineering using ionic liquids 11 , 12 . Unfortunately, the fast crystallization kinetics of FAPbI 3
perovskites precludes in-depth investigations of its film-formation processes 5 , 6 . The microscale mechanism of its phase evolution during crystallization has yet to be unambiguously defined 13 , 14 . This lack of information has hampered the development of more-rational and targeted design of film-processing methods for efficient FAPbI 3
perovskite absorbers, especially for different film-processing scenarios, such as one-step and two-step film-deposition protocols and small- and large-area devices 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 . A strategy to promote the formation of black-phase FAPbI 3
in one processing scenario usually fails when applied to other situations. In this study we observed an oriented nucleation mechanism that originated from the reduced surface energy of a specific crystallographic plane, and this enabled us to avoid the yellow phase of FAPbI 3
and governed the formation of black-phase FAPbI 3 . We verified the mechanism for different film-deposition methods and found it could be applied to improve the performance of both small-area devices and solar modules. In a two-step deposition protocol for perovskite films, in which the PbI 2
and organo-halide precursors were deposited sequentially, intermediate non-photoactive phases were always observed at room temperature. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the deposited perovskite film at room temperature showed diffraction peaks corresponding to the (100) planes of the black phase, accompanied by diffraction peaks of the the hexagonal perovskite polytype 2H and 6H intermediate phases (Fig.
1a ). When pentanamidine hydrochloride (PAD) was incorporated in the precursor of the organic cations, the intermediate phases were eliminated. Density-functional theory calculations and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were used to investigate how PAD interacts with the Pb–I framework. As modelled in Fig.
1b , the positively charged amidinium head of PAD was able to anchor into the octahedral cavity of the black-phase perovskite by means of electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions. Peak shifts of the C=N and N–H vibration could be seen in the FTIR spectra of PAD after mixing with PbI 2 , confirming the strong interaction between PAD and the Pb–I framework through the amidinium unit (Extended Data Fig.
1 ). This interaction exposed the hydrophobic alkyl chain of PAD such that it was stacked in an ordered manner on the black-phase perovskite (100) plane. As a result, compared with the other planes, the surface energy of the perovskite (100) plane was decreased the most (it fell by 64% from 3.16 to 1.14 eV) when the plane was terminated by PAD (see Supplementary Note
1
for details of the calculation and the variations in surface energy of different crystallographic planes). The configuration of this interaction was corroborated by the formation of a two-dimensional perovskite phase, characterized by XRD of the perovskite film fabricated with PAD (Supplementary Fig.
1 ). The reduced dimension of the perovskite phase evidenced the extremely low surface energy of the (100) plane. This thermodynamic driving force led to the preferential formation of the (100) orientation of black-phase perovskite, which determined the crystallization texture and promoted the formation of black-phase perovskite crystals. By contrast, the relatively even energy profile of the phase transformation process without PAD resulted in the coexistence of several phases and orientations (Fig.
1c ). Fig. 1: Direct formation of black-phase FAPbI 3

2 . In situ grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements revealed that the perovskite nucleated when the formamidinium iodide solution was dropped onto pre-deposited PbI 2 ; this could be seen by the emergence of the perovskite (100) diffraction peak (Fig.
2a ). During the spin-coating process, the peak intensity of the (100) plane gradually increased, which we describe as a nucleation stage in which the disappearance, formation and growth of the nuclei take place concurrently. The subsequent annealing step led to a rapid rise in the intensity of the (100) peak, indicating a fast crystal growth process. During the nucleation stage, the control perovskite film showed diffraction peaks corresponding to multiple intermediate phases, whereas the film using PAD featured a clean (100) diffraction pattern of black-phase perovskite. This finding indicates that incorporating PAD suppressed the formation of yellow phases from the start of the nucleation process. Notably, the control film had a faster increase in the (100) peak intensity during the nucleation stage than that with PAD, indicating that PAD led to delayed nucleation kinetics. This slower nucleation may be attributed to the strong interaction of PAD with the Pb–I framework, because the formamidinium had to compete with PAD to interact with the Pb–I, slowing down the reaction. The in situ azimuth angle mapping was extracted from the GIXRD patterns of the perovskite (100) plane during the nucleation stage (Fig.
2b ). The azimuth angle showed a broad distribution ranging approximately from 60° to 120°, indicating that the control sample had a fairly random crystallographic orientation. However, a sharp peak centred at the azimuth angle of 90° was observed when PAD was incorporated, and the half-peak width remained as small as around 8°. These findings verified that there is a nucleation stage with a preferred out-of-plane orientation along the (100) facet, which we described as an oriented nucleation mechanism.

c , The evolution of the photoluminescence spectra during the nucleation stage of perovskite films without PAD (top) and with PAD (bottom). Full size image We studied the proposed mechanism further by varying the length of the alkyl chain attached to the organic amidinium cation, thereby modulating the effect on the surface energy. Butylamidine hydrochloride (BAD) and propionamidine hydrochloride (PRD), which have shorter alkyl chains than PAD, were investigated. Calculations based on density-functional theory revealed an increase in the surface energy of the perovskite (100) plane as the alkyl chain became shorter (Extended Data Fig.
2 ). The (100) plane that terminated with PRD, BAD or PAD, which featured an increasingly elongated and exposed organic tail and thus increased hydrophobicity, had a calculated surface energy of 1.57, 1.20 and 1.14 eV nm −2 , respectively. In situ GIXRD measurements revealed that both BAD and PRD suppressed the formation of intermediate photo-inactive phases during the nucleation stage (Extended Data Fig.
3 ). However, the in situ azimuth angle mapped during the nucleation stage demonstrated different levels of oriented nucleation as the surface energy varied (Extended Data Fig.
4 ). Because adding PAD provided the lowest surface energy of the perovskite (100) plane, it induced the most-oriented nucleation of the three additives. Despite the ability of BAD and PRD to induce more-oriented nucleation than the control sample, they resulted in broader azimuth-angle distributions than did PAD. These observations demonstrated that the oriented nucleation and the promoted formation of black-phase perovskite were governed by the surface energy of perovskite (100) plane. In situ photoluminescence measurements provided further evidence of the sluggish nucleation kinetics. The evolution of the photoluminescence spectra of the perovskite films during the nucleation stage is shown in Fig.
2c . Without PAD, a photoluminescence peak at 770 nm rose rapidly, which we attribute to the photoactive perovskite phase. With PAD in the precursor solution, the photoluminescence peak appeared at 760 nm with delayed kinetics. The slight blue-shift in the photoluminescence peak could be attributed to the smaller size of the nuclei, which could either lead to compressive lattice strain or induce stronger quantum confinement (Extended Data Fig.
5 ). This in turn provided evidence of the slower nucleation kinetics in perovskite films with PAD. Sluggish nucleation kinetics were also observed for BAD and PRD (Extended Data Fig.
6 ), but to a lesser extent than for PAD, further confirming the important role of surface energy in regulating the crystallization. The strong interaction between the inorganic framework of the perovskite and the PAD cation lowered the surface energy of the (100) plane, leading to slower nucleation kinetics with preferred crystallographic orientation. This oriented nucleation mechanism governed the subsequent crystal growth step, which also followed the preferred orientation along the (100) facet 19
(Supplementary Fig.
2 ). The resulting perovskite film exhibited higher crystallinity and conductivity, as indicated by the increased intensity of the XRD patterns and by conductive atomic-force-microscopy measurements, respectively (Supplementary Figs.
3
and
4 ). The film also had larger grain sizes as a result of the slower nucleation (Supplementary Fig.
5 ). The enhanced photoluminescence intensity and prolonged photoluminescence lifetime of the PAD-based perovskite film indicated that there were fewer non-radiative recombination sites (Extended Data Fig.
7 ). We investigated the incorporation of PAD in a one-step deposition protocol and observed the elimination of the yellow phase. As revealed by the in situ XRD measurements, a mixture of intermediate phases appeared with the black-phase perovskite during crystallization in the absence of PAD (Fig.
3a ). By contrast, incorporating PAD eliminated all the intermediate phases, leading to a single diffraction feature apparent from the (100) plane of black-phase perovskite (Fig.
3b ). In situ photoluminescence measurements of the perovskite films with and without PAD were performed (Supplementary Note
3 ). The evolution profiles of the photoluminescence peak positions and photoluminescence intensity with time are shown in Fig.
3c , d , respectively. In the control sample, we observed a turning point (highlighted by the red dashed area in Fig.
3c , d ) in the evolution profile of the photoluminescence peak position, which coincides with fluctuations in photoluminescence intensity. In general, changes in the photoluminescence peak position may be related to lattice or structural changes. Therefore this turning point might indicate the emergence of intermediate phases during the crystallization, in addition to the black phase. The perovskite film with PAD instead exhibited a smooth photoluminescence evolution profile for both peak position and peak intensity, further verifying the direct conversion to the black phase. The perovskite film with PAD exhibited considerably enhanced photoluminescence intensity and photoluminescence lifetime (Fig.
3e , f ), indicative of pure black-phase perovskite with reduced non-radiative recombination sites in the film.

Full size image We subsequently evaluated the photovoltaic performance of the fabricated solar-cell devices. For the two-step deposition protocol (Extended Data Fig.
8 ), the device made with PAD had the best power conversion efficiency (PCE), achieving 24.0%, whereas the best control device had a PCE of only 22.9%, primarily because the PAD version had an increased fill factor and open circuit voltage (Fig.
4a ). This was attributed to the reduced non-radiative recombination in the device with PAD, as demonstrated by the slower transient photovoltage decay (Supplementary Fig.
6 ). The short-circuit currents of the device were marginally enhanced, reflecting the slightly faster transient photocurrent decay of the device with PAD 20 , 21
(Supplementary Fig.
7 ). A similar trend in device performance was observed for the one-step method (Fig.
4b
and Extended Data Fig.
9 ). The device with PAD demonstrated an improved PCE of up to 25.4% (certified at 25.0%). The histogram of PCEs for 36 devices is shown in Fig.
4c
(the detailed parameters are shown in Supplementary Table
1 ), which confirms that the performance improvements of devices made with PAD were highly reproducible (a 5.6% improvement in average PCE from 23.7 ± 0.4% to 25.0 ± 0.4% when PAD was incorporated). We further extended the application of PAD to the fabrication of solar modules to verify its compatibility with upscaled devices. A high aperture efficiency of 21.4% (certified) was achieved for the PAD-based perovskite module with an area of 27.83 cm 2
(Fig.
4d ). The module showed an average PCE of 20.4%, whereas the control module had an average PCE of only 18.9%, further demonstrating the universality of the approach (Extended Data Fig.
10 ). Our fabricated devices also demonstrated considerably improved operational stability. When tracked at the maximum power point (MPP) with constant illumination at 30 ± 3 °C, the PCE of the control device fell by 30%, whereas the device fabricated with PAD maintained 95% of its initial PCE after more than 1,000 h (Fig.
4e ). In an accelerated-ageing test at 65 ± 3 °C and 85 ± 5% relative humidity, the device with PAD kept more than 82% of its initial PCE after more than 500 h when held at the MPP under constant illumination, whereas the PCE of the control device decreased by around 37% (Supplementary Fig.
8 ). This increased stability could be attributed to the higher crystallinity, reduced defect density and reduced surface energy caused by PAD 8 , 22 , 23

Device fabrication Fabrication of perovskite solar cells by the two-step method In the two-step method, perovskite solar cells were fabricated with the following structure: indium tin oxide (ITO)/SnO 2 /FA 0.95 Cs 0.05 PbI 3 /Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag (or Au). The ITO glass was precleaned in an ultrasonic bath of acetone and isopropanol and was ultraviolet light–ozone treated for 20 min before use. A thin layer (around 30 nm) of SnO 2
was spin-coated onto the ITO glass and baked at 165 °C for 35 min. SnO 2
solution was diluted in water ( V SnO2 : V H2O
at a ratio of 1:4) before spin-coating. After cooling to room temperature, the glass, ITO and SnO 2
substrates were transferred to a nitrogen glove box. The PbI 2
solution was prepared by dissolving 1.4 M PbI 2
and 0.07 M CsI into 1 ml DMF or DMSO (v/v 94/6). The FAI solution for the control film was prepared by dissolving 80 mg FAI and 13 mg MACl in 1 ml isopropanol. For the preparation of precursors with PAD, BAD or PRD, 2.05 mg PAD, 1.84 mg BAD or 1.63 mg PRD was added to the FAI solution in isopropanol. The solution was stirred overnight before use. To fabricate the perovskite layer, the PbI 2
solution was spin-coated on the substrate at 1,500 rpm for 40 s, and the FAI–PAD, FAI–BAD or FAI–PRD solution was then spin-coated on the PbI 2
film at 1,800 rpm for 40 s, followed by pre-annealing in the glove box at 90 °C for 1 min and annealing outside the glove box at 150 °C for 10 min with 30–40% humidity. The first-step and second-step precursors are denoted as the PbI 2
solution and the FAI solution, respectively, for simplicity, with the exact compositions described above). The Spiro-OMeTAD solution (60 mg Spiro-OMeTAD in 700 µl chlorobenzene with 25.5 µl 4- tert -butylpyridine, 15.5 µl Li–TFSI (520 mg ml −1
in ACN) and 12.5 µl FK209 (375 mg ml −1
in ACN)) was spun onto the perovskite film as a hole conductor. The devices were completed by evaporating 100 nm of either gold or silver in a vacuum chamber (base pressure, 5 × 10 −4  Pa), and the aperture area of the device is 0.1 cm 2 , designated by the shadow mask. Fabrication of perovskite solar cells by the one-step method The device with an architecture of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass/compact TiO 2
layer (c-TiO 2 )/compact SnO 2
layer, (c-SnO 2 )/Cs 0.05 MA 0.05 FA 0.9 PbI 3
(PVK)/spiro-OMeTAD (HTM)/Au structure was fabricated. The patterned FTO substrate (Asahi FTO glass, 12–13 Ω cm  −2 ) was sequentially cleaned with detergent (5% Hellmanex in water), deionized water, acetone and isopropanol in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min. The FTO substrate was then further cleaned with ultraviolet light–ozone surface treatment for 15 min. The c-TiO 2
and SnO 2
layers were sequentially deposited on the clean FTO substrate by chemical bath deposition. The substrate was annealed on a hotplate at 190 °C for 60 min. The perovskite precursor solution (1.4 M) was prepared by adding 645.4 mg PbI 2 , 216.7 mg FAI, 11.1 mg methylammonium iodide and 11.8 mg CsCl into a mixture of 200 μl DMSO and 800 μl DMF. The solution was then stirred for 2 h at 60 °C before 2.09 mg PAD was dissolved into 1.0 ml of DMSO to make a stock solution (concentration around 0.52 M). After ultraviolet light–ozone treatment of the substrates for 15 min, the perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated onto the surface of the FTO/c-TiO 2 /c-SnO 2
substrate at 1,000 rpm for 10 s, accelerated to 5,000 rpm for 5 s and maintained at this speed for 20 s. This process was done in an N 2 -filled glove box. The substrate was then placed in custom-made rapid vacuum drying equipment. After pumping for 20 s, a brown, transparent perovskite film with a mirror-like surface was obtained. The fresh perovskite layer was annealed at 100 °C for 1 h and then at 150 °C for 10 min. Then 60 μl phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) solution (5 mg ml −1
in isopropanol) was spin-coated on the perovskite film at 5,000 rpm for 30 s. A hole transport layer was deposited on the perovskite film by depositing a doped spiro-OMeTAD solution at 3,000 rpm for 30 s. The doped spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 105 mg of spiro-OMeTAD and 41 μl 4- tert -butylpyridine in 1,343 μl chlorobenzene with an additional 25 μl Li–TFSI solution (517 mg ml −1
in ACN) and 19 μl cobalt-complex solution (376 mg ml −1
in ACN). Finally, a gold layer approximately 70 nm thick was evaporated on the spiro-OMeTAD layer as the back electrode, and the aperture area of the certified device is 0.06 cm 2 . Fabrication of perovskite modules Perovskite solar modules, with 8 subcells connected in series, were fabricated on FTO glass substrates with a size of 6.5 × 7.0 cm. The series interconnection of the module was realized by P1, P2 and P3 lines, which were patterned using a laser scribing system with a 1,064 nm laser and a power of 20 W (Trotec). The FTO substrate was pre-patterned for P1 (a width of 50 μm) by means of 60% laser power at a speed of 300 mm s −1
with a frequency of 65 kHz and a pulse width of 120 ns. The subsequent processes for the preparation of c-TiO 2
and c-SnO 2
substrates are the same as the procedures for the small-area device. The perovskite precursor deposition and fabrication procedures were similar to those of the small-size solar cells, except for the concentration of perovskite precursor. A perovskite precursor (1.2 M) was used to make the perovskite layer by spin-coating and the custom-made gas-induced pump method. The perovskite precursor was spin-coated on the c-TiO 2
and c-SnO 2
substrates, which are similar to those for the small-size devices. The perovskite films were annealed at 100 °C for 1 h and 150 °C for 10 min. After cooling to room temperature, the Spiro-OMeTAD layer was similar to those of the small-size devices. The P2 lines (a width of 150 μm) were patterned before the gold evaporation process step with an average laser power of 15% at a speed of 1,000 μm s −1
and a frequency of 65 kHz for a pulse duration of 120 ns. When a gold layer 70 nm thick was deposited, the P3 line (a width of 100 μm) was fabricated under the same scribing conditions as the P2 line. The distance between P1 and P3 was around 400 μm and the geometric fill factor was around 0.93. For solar modules prepared by the blade-coating method (Coatmaster 510), perovskite solar modules with 9 subcells connected in series were fabricated on FTO glass substrates with a size of 6.5 × 7.0 cm. The processes for the preparation of c-TiO 2
and c-SnO 2
substrates and the fabrication of spiro-OMeTAD, as well as the gold electrode, were the same as for the gas-pump method. The perovskite precursor solution (1.2 M) was prepared by dissolving 580.9 mg PbI 2 , 185.7 mg FAI, 9.5 mg methylammonium iodide and 10.8 mg CsCl into 1.0 ml 2-methoxyethanol. The precursor solution was blade-coated onto the c-TiO 2
and c-SnO 2
substrates with a gap of 260 µm at a movement speed of 21 mm s −1
in the N 2
glovebox. The N 2
knife was operated at 30 psi during blade-coating and the as-obtained perovskite films were annealed at 100 °C for 1 h and 150 °C for 10 min. The laser scribing procedures were the same as for the gas-pump method, but the geometric fill factor was 0.91. Stability test The photovoltaic devices to be tested for stability were fabricated as described above. They were encapsulated by a glass–glass encapsulation technology combined with an edge seal (curing sealant 3035B, ThreeBond) to seal the device under ultraviolet light (LED flood lamp, DELOLUX 20). The edge of the device was first cleared by laser. Indium was soldered on the FTO and gold electrodes on the edge of the 15 mm × 25 mm substrate. A glass coverslip with a size of 13 mm × 23 mm was placed on top of the gold layer of the device. Sealant was placed on the edges of the coverslip to seal the gap between the coverslip and device. Finally, ultraviolet light was used to induce cross-linking between the sealant and the coverslip at 25% of maximum power for 120 s in the glove box. For the stability test at ambient conditions (30 ± 3 °C), unencapsulated devices were evaluated. For the accelerated-degradation test, the encapsulated devices were kept in a thermo-hygrostat (GP/TH-150, SH Guangpin), which was set to 85 ± 5% relative humidity at 65 ± 3 °C. The performance of the devices was measured electronically using a 22-bit delta-sigma analogue-to-digital converter. A reference Si photodiode was placed in close to the devices to record the light intensity. Long-term stability tests were done at the MPP using a tracking algorithm for an illumination of 1 sun (standard illumination at 1 kW m −2 ) according to the ISOS-L-3 protocol. Device characterization Current density–voltage characteristics of photovoltaic cells were determined using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit under a simulated AM1.5G spectrum with an Oriel 9600 solar simulator. Typically, small devices were measured in a reverse scan (1.20 V to 0 V with steps of 0.01 V for one-step devices and 1.25 V to 0 V with steps of 0.02 V for two-step devices). The modules were measured in a reverse scan (from 9.45 V to 0 V) at a constant scan speed of 100 mV s −1
with a step of 50 mV. For the measurement of high-efficiency devices, an antireflection film was applied to the surface of devices. All devices were measured without pre-conditioning such as light-soaking or a bias voltage. The steady-state power-conversion efficiency was calculated by measuring the stabilized photocurrent density under a constant bias voltage. External quantum efficiencies were measured using an integrated system (Enlitech) and a lock-in amplifier with a current preamplifier under the short-circuit condition. Material characterization and spectroscopic investigation Ultraviolet-light and visual-light absorption spectra of the perovskite films were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-VIS-NIR (UV3600Plus + UV2700) spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere, in which monochromatic light was incident to the substrate side. To measure time-resolved photoluminescence, the sample was excited using a picosecond-pulse diode laser (Pico-quant LDH 450) with a roughly 70-ps pulse width and a repetition rate of 20 MHz or 10 MHz, focused on a sample with a 100× objective lens and a numerical aperture of 0.90. The photoluminescence signal was acquired through the TCSPC strobelock system. The total instrument response function for the photoluminescence decay was less than 200 ps and the temporal resolution was less than 30 ps. XRD experiments were performed using a sealed-tube Cu X-ray source, equipped with 1D LynxEye detector. The in situ experiment was performed with a high-brilliance rotational point-focused Cu X-ray source, equipped with duo detectors of a scintillation counter and LynxEye. The in situ chamber of TC DOME created a robust heating environment and measurement was initiated with a temperature increasing from room temperature to an air temperature of 450 K, followed by XRD data collection. The transient photovoltage and transient photocurrent were measured by a photo-electrochemical system. A conductive atomic-force microscope was used for environmental atomic force microscopy, and an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer was used (ThermoFisher ESCALAB Xi+). Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV) was used as the excitation source. Transmission FTIR spectroscopy was done using an FT/IR-6100 (Jasco). PAD was mixed with PbI 2
using a molar ratio of 1:1 for the FTIR measurements. Ultraviolet-light photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were carried out to determine the work function and the position of valence band maximum of materials. A helium discharge lamp, emitting ultraviolet-light energy at 21.2 eV, was used for excitation. All ultraviolet-light photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were made using standard procedures with a −10 V bias applied between the samples and detectors. Clean gold was used as a reference. Grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) was performed during spin coating and thermal annealing in a custom-made spin coater. The spin coater is attached to the endstation of beamline 12.3.2 at the Advanced Light Source (ALS), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. This custom-made setup allows thin film fabrication from solutions including remotely triggered antisolvent dripping during the measurement in the hutch. While the film is fabricated, diffraction and PL data can be collected simultaneously. The incoming X-ray beam was at a shallow angle of 1° with a beam energy of 10 keV. A DECTRIS Pilatus 1M X-ray detector at an angle of 35° to the sample plane and a sample-to-detector distance of ~189 mm was used. Measurements were carried out on an area of 0.06 mm 2
(12 mm × 0.005 mm) with an approximate flux of ~109 photons s –1 . The spin coater setup is designed in such a way that the experiment can be performed remotely, avoiding any transfer delays between film deposition and annealing. Samples were heated using a temperature ramp of about 4.5 °C s –1
to their annealing temperature. The diffraction data was collected with a frame rate of 1.8 s –1 . The 2D diffraction images were initially analysed using custom-made software and then further analysed by using Igor Pro 8.04 software using Irena and Nika packages 24 , 25 .

Abstract Spiro-OMeTAD, one of the most widely used hole-transport materials (HTMs) in optoelectronic devices, typically requires chemical doping with a lithium compound (LiTFSI) to attain sufficient conductivity and efficient hole extraction. However, the doping step requires an activation process that comprises exposure of the blend films to an ambient atmosphere. Additionally, the lithium dopant induces crystallization, and its hygroscopic nature negatively impacts device performance and lifetime. Here we report a facile approach based on the incorporation of a low-cost alkylthiol additive (1-dodecanethiol, DDT) in the spiro-OMeTAD HTM. We discover that DDT provides a more efficient and controllable doping process with significantly reduced doping duration, enabling the HTM to achieve comparable performance before air activation. The coordination between DDT and LiTFSI increases the concentration of dopants in the HTM bulk, reduces their accumulation at interfaces, and enhances the structural integrity of the HTM under wetting, heat and light stress. We fabricate perovskite solar cells using DDT-treated spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM. Our best devices exhibit a certified power conversion efficiency of 23.1%. Furthermore, the devices can retain 90% of peak performance under continuous illumination for 1,000 h. Our findings represent an important step forward in the production of doped spiro-OMeTAD, as well as its reliable application and future device commercialization.

Main The deliberate addition of impurities (doping) can modify the electronic properties of organic semiconductors. The discovery of this effect has contributed to the dramatic development of the electronic devices that pervade today’s society 1 . Doped organic semiconductors are used to facilitate the transport of holes—positively charged quasiparticles produced as part of a solar cell’s power-generating mechanism. The organic semiconductor 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis( N , N -di- p -methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) is one of the most widely used hole-transport materials (HTMs), and is typically accompanied by the lithium salt lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) as its p-dopant. Such blend films have laid the foundation for the development of many optoelectronic technologies, such as dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) 2 , perovskite solar cells (PSCs) 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7
and antimony chalcogenide (Sb 2 (S,Se) 3 ) solar cells 8 , 9 , 10 , and have continuously delivered record-breaking power-conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in PSCs 4 , 6
(Supplementary Table
1 ) and Sb 2 (S,Se) 3
solar cells 10
(Supplementary Table
2 ). The recipe for this blend film has rarely changed over the past decade. Despite the demonstrated exceptional achievements, the controllability of the doping process and stability (lifetime) of doped spiro-OMeTAD under external stimuli remain largely untapped. The doping process for spiro-OMeTAD HTM requires air/oxygen activation, so the doping results depend greatly on the ambient conditions 11 . More challengingly, the lithium compound reduces the lifetime of the HTMs 12
because (1) it has a hygroscopic nature, which leads to film instability in moisture 13 , 14 , (2) it induces crystallization of the films under heat 15
and (3) mobile lithium ions may diffuse into and impact other functional materials 16 . Alternative doping approaches 17 , 18
and dopant-free HTMs 19 , 20
have been developed to address these shortcomings, but none of the resulting solar cells have matched the performances of record-setting solar cells. Thiol and thiol-derived compounds have been driving the rapid progress in lithium-sulfide batteries 21 . The formation of stable coordination bonds between lithium and thiol/thiol-derived compounds can maintain the structural integrity of such batteries during their redox reactions 21 , 22 . Inspired by this character of thiols, in this Article we explore a low-cost additive—1-dodecanethiol (DDT)—in an attempt to overcome the limitations of the classic doped spiro-OMeTAD HTM. DDT was incorporated into PSCs to systematically investigate its impact on the classic spiro-OMeTAD HTM. First, unlike previous studies of DDT on modifying the topography of functional layers in organic solar cells 23 , 24 , our results show that some thiol groups in DDT can couple into disulfide groups under certain conditions. These disulfide groups can act in a similar role to O 2 , oxidizing the spiro-OMeTAD HTM. The DDT-treated spiro-OMeTAD HTMs and associated solar cells therefore achieve good performance before air activation. Second, DDT not only increases the films’ hydrophobicity, but also reduces their pinhole size, creating kinetic barriers in the doped spiro-OMeTAD HTM against the ingression of moisture. Third, DDT coordinates with lithium compounds, maintaining the HTM’s structural integrity, locking the lithium dopants into the HTM, and preventing the HTM film from crystallizing under a range of stimuli. Finally, DDT-treated films impede ion migration from other stacks. Device stabilities are therefore markedly improved under ambient air, wetting, thermal and continuous illumination stimuli. The price of DDT is less than US$0.033 per gram 25 , ensuring negligible add-on cost for future commercialization. Results and discussion The impact of DDT on p-doping We first analysed spiro-OMeTAD HTMs in complete devices. UV–vis absorption spectroscopy, kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) were performed. The characteristic peak at 520 nm for the DDT-treated sample (Fig.
1a ) confirms the generation of radical cations, that is, spiro-OMeTAD •+
(refs.
2 , 18 ), before air activation. Using KPFM (Fig.
1b
and Supplementary Fig.
1 ), we observe a pronounced shift of work function, with the DDT-treated sample showing a higher work-function value (4.55 eV) than the control (4.46 eV), which is very close to that (4.52 eV) of the control after air activation. Although both control and DDT samples give further-increased work-function values after air activation, more significant enhancement is observed in the DDT-treated sample, increasing to 4.74 eV. This indicates that the DDT-treated sample has a lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level than the control, in light of the Fermi level for the doped spiro-OMeTAD HTM lying very close to the edge of the HOMO level 26 , which also implies an enhanced p-type character 27 . In UPS measurements (Supplementary Fig.
2 ), the Fermi level is seen to shift closer to the HOMO level of the spiro-OMeTAD HTM, further confirming the p-type character induced by DDT.

e , f , AFM images of the spiro-OMeTAD HTMs for the control sample ( e ) and DDT-treated sample ( f ). Scale bars, 1 µm. Full size image In the case of the control, O 2
in air binds with pristine spiro-OMeTAD to form a donor–acceptor complex, spiro-OMeTAD • + O 2 • −
(refs.
11 , 28 ). LiTFSI mediates the reaction between the O 2
and spiro-OMeTAD, producing a TFSI-stabilized radical cation 28 . The HTM is then p-doped once a critical concentration of radical cations is trapped. In stark contrast to the control, which requires air activation, the DDT-treated films exhibit obvious p-doping character before the air process. Nevertheless, DDT often acts as the electron donor rather than the electron acceptor. We thus performed
1 H NMR analysis to unravel the underlying mechanism and the associated trigger conditions for the reaction. The NMR results (Supplementary Fig.
3a ) show that the DDT sample before Au-contact thermal evaporation shows very sharp and distinct spiro-OMeTAD peaks of δ 3.46 (s, –OMe), 6.9–6.7 (–fluorene, –Ph) and 7.2 ppm (–Ph). However, after thermal evaporation of the Au contact, all three characteristic peaks are broadened, confirming the formation of oxidized spiro-OMeTAD • +
(refs.
29 , 30 ). We observe an emerging chemical species with a triplet at δ 2.62 ppm for the DDT-treated spiro-OMeTAD sample after thermal evaporation of the Au contact (Supplementary Fig.
3b ). This new peak can be assigned to the protons of methylene (–CH 2 –S–S) in didodecyl disulfide (DDS) 31 . Thiols can couple into disulfide upon illumination, heat or alkaline stimuli, with the generation of the hydrogen as by-product 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 . In this case, moderate thermal irradiation during Au-contact evaporation and alkaline additives (4- tert -butylpyridine ( t BP) and acetonitrile) in the doped spiro-OMeTAD precursor facilitate DDT coupling into DDS. Unlike thiol, disulfide is an oxidant that can be reduced by accepting electrons, like O 2 . By proton integrations, the molar ratio of [DDS]/[residual DDT] was calculated to be ~2.5:1. UV–vis absorption data (Supplementary Fig.
4 ) agree with the NMR results. The impact of DDT on HTM structure Contact-angle measurements, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were carried out. The water droplet contact angle on the DDT-treated film (101.2°) is much larger than that on the control (32.3°) (Fig.
1c,d ), indicating markedly reduced hygroscopicity. A starkly reduced pinhole size as a result of the incorporation of DDT is also observed in the AFM results (Fig.
1e,f ), but DDT has a negligible impact on the film thickness (Supplementary Fig.
5 ). We tracked unencapsulated samples of indium tin oxide (ITO)/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD HTM in ambient air (relative humidity (RH) = 35–70%). No discolouration is observed with the DDT-treated sample, even after 2,880 h (Supplementary Fig.
6 ). Obviously, the increased hydrophobicity and the reduced pinhole size create kinetic barriers that slow down the intrusion of moisture. The impact of DDT on the lithium compound Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed to investigate the formation of coordination bonds between the DDT and LiTFSI. From the FTIR results (Fig.
2a ), S–N in pure LiTFSI shows a typical symmetric stretching vibration mode at 800 cm −1
and an asymmetric stretching vibration mode at 1,056 cm −1
(ref.
36 ), which shift to 832 cm −1
and 1,008 cm −1 , respectively, when mixed with DDT. The downward shift of the S–N asymmetric stretching vibration frequency of 48 cm −1
may result from electron delocalization when a Lewis base–acid adduct is formed, demonstrating a strong interaction between DDT and LiTFSI. Supplementary Fig.
7
shows the FTIR results for more samples. Fig. 2: The impact of DDT on the lithium compound. a , Full and expanded FTIR spectra of a DDT-LiTFSI mixture (red), LiTFSI (blue) and DDT (black). Inset: schematic of the coordination between LiTFSI and DDT. Va(S–N) is the asymmetric stretching vibration mode of the S–N bond in LiTFSI.

b – d , TOF-SIMS depth profiles for the control device ( b ) and the DDT-treated device before air activation ( c ), and overlay of the depth profiles of the control device (dashed lines) and the DDT-treated device (solid lines) ( d ). Full size image The strong interaction between DDT and LiTFSI was further confirmed by time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS). In Fig.
2b,c , DDT shows a homogeneous distribution throughout the doped spiro-OMeTAD HTM, accompanied by the desired significantly improved distribution of LiTFSI. Lithium cations show an enhanced intensity throughout the DDT-treated HTM (Fig.
2d ), approximately one order of magnitude higher than that of the control. This greatly improved Li + -TFSI −
distribution is believed to be beneficial to the performance of the spiro-OMeTAD HTMs and their devices, because dopant accumulation at interfaces and a dopant gradient in the bulk usually result in poor electrical properties 18 , 37 , 38 . The impact of DDT on charge transport and recombination Space-charge-limited current, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed to investigate charge transport and recombination in the spiro-OMeTAD HTMs before air activation. DDT enhances the hole mobility by approximately one order of magnitude from 2.7 × 10 −3  cm 2  V −1  s −1
to 1.1 × 10 −2  cm 2  V −1  s −1
(Supplementary Fig.
8a ). The PL intensity of perovskite in the DDT-treated sample quenches more than in the control, indicating more efficient hole injection from perovskite to the spiro-OMeTAD HTM (Supplementary Fig.
8b ). The fitted series resistance ( R S ) value for the DDT-treated sample (1.2 Ω cm 2 ) is lower than that of the control (3.9 Ω cm 2 ), whereas the fitted recombination resistance ( R REC ; 1,927 Ω cm 2 ) is higher than that of the control (589 Ω cm 2 ) (Supplementary Fig.
8c ). The lower
R S
and higher
R REC
indicate faster charge transport and reduced recombination within the DDT-treated samples. We exclude a possible role of DDT in passivating the perovskite surface underneath, because the PL intensity measured when DDT is directly deposited on the perovskite surface remains almost identical to that of the control (Supplementary Fig.
8d ), thus showing the unique role of DDT when in the HTM. The impact of DDT on device performance For Cs 0.05 (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15
PSCs prepared by solvent engineering and with a mole ratio of DDT/LiTFSI = 0.34 in the spiro-OMeTAD precursor, we observed markedly improved PCEs before air activation (Fig.
3a , Supplementary Fig.
9
and Supplementary Table
3 ). The DDT-treated cell shows a PCE of 20.0%, with an open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 1.15 V, a short-circuit photocurrent density ( J SC ) of 22.0 mA cm −2
and a fill factor (FF) of 79.4%. Further air activation gives a comparable and slightly higher performance, with a PCE of 21.2%,
V OC
of 1.16 V,
J SC
of 22.5 mA cm −2
and FF of 81.5%. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) results are shown in Supplementary Fig.
10 . In contrast, the control cell before air activation only exhibits a poor initial PCE of 8.7%. This jumps to 20.2% after air activation, with a
V OC
of 1.13 V,
J SC
of 22.7 mA cm −2
and FF of 78.5%. The average values for the photovoltaic parameters of all the Cs 0.05 (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15
PSCs are shown in the caption of Supplementary Fig.

and FF of 81.6% after using an anti-reflection film, with little hysteresis (Fig.
3b ; the certified PCE is 21.63%). Figure
3c
presents stabilized-power-output (SPO) results at the maximum power point (MPP). Our in-house-measured fresh devices show little hysteresis, although an increased hysteresis was observed for the certification. This might be due to degradation of the device during shipping and queuing for the certification. Similar hysteresis enlargement has been reported elsewhere 39 .

PSCs prepared by sequential deposition. In control devices, the best PCE is 22.7%, along with a
V OC
of 1.171 V,
J SC
of 25.8 mA cm −2
and FF of 75.2%. Superior performance is observed for the DDT-treated cells, as expected, yielding a champion PCE of 24.6% (certified PCE of 23.1%) with a
V OC
of 1.198 V,
J SC
of 25.9 mA cm −2
and FF of 79.2% (Fig.
3d ), although there is hysteresis (Supplementary Fig.
11 ). This hysteresis usually originates from unbalanced charge extraction and ion migration, which in the current case of sequential deposition is related to its slow nucleus formation and crystallization 40 . Supplementary Fig.

shows the EQE results for the cell. The average values for the photovoltaic parameters of small-area Cs 0.05 FA x MA 1 −  x PbI 3
PSCs (0.09 cm 2 ) are presented in Supplementary Table
4 . We also fabricated PSCs with larger areas, and our best-performing large-area cell (1.0 cm 2 ) demonstrates PCEs of up to 23.1% (Supplementary Fig.
13 ; certified PCE of 21.72%). Note that the certified cells were measured after a three-month waiting period (stored in a N 2 -purged desiccator) for certification. The average values for the photovoltaic parameters of the large-area PSCs (1.0 cm 2 ) are shown in Supplementary Table
5 . To investigate the uniqueness of DDT, we fabricated solar cells using the aforementioned DDS-treated spiro-OMeTAD HTMs by incorporating DDS into the spiro-OMeTAD precursor. Both the champion (18.3%) and average (14.8%) performances of the DDS-treated cells are inferior to those of their DDT-treated counterparts (Supplementary Fig.
14 ; more results are shown in Supplementary Fig.
15 ). Although the best DDS-treated cells demonstrate a reasonable performance degradation (13.2%) after 1,000 h in ambient air (<10% RH, 25–30 °C, open-circuit condition), the best DDT-treated cells show decent stability (6.4%) over 2,200 h, as shown in Supplementary Fig.
15
and Supplementary Table
6 . We observe undesired denser pinholes for the DDS-treated sample compared with the DDT counterpart, although DDS did reduce the pinhole sizes compared to the control (Supplementary Fig.
16a–c ). The length of the alkyl chain is also important to the film’s morphology. Octadecanethiol (ODT), which has a longer alkyl chain than DDT, leads to a larger pinhole size (Supplementary Fig.
16d
and Supplementary Table
7 ). Larger and denser pinholes may lead to inferior carrier extraction in the HTMs due to reduced coverage on absorbers, which may provide more pathways for the ingression of moisture and O 2 . On the other hand, the reducibility of residual DDT in DDT-treated samples is beneficial in preventing the soft crystal lattice of perovskite from deforming when exposing to O 2
(ref.
41 ). Supplementary Tables

cells before and after ageing in ambient air. The impact of DDT on stabilities We use Cs 0.05 (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15
devices for all stability measurements, and all samples are air-activated for 48 h to attain peak efficiency. Wetting stability We investigated the impact of DDT on wetting stability by conducting wetting stress experiments (RH = 50%, open circuit, air atmosphere and ambient lighting) on unencapsulated PSCs. Figure
4a
shows that the best control cell demonstrates a slow PCE degradation during the first 100 h, followed by a quick degradation, decreasing to 68% of peak PCE after another 430 h. By contrast, the best DDT-treated cell demonstrates greatly improved wetting stability, retaining a high PCE of up to 97% over the same measurement period. More cell wetting results are provided in Supplementary Table

4b
and Supplementary Fig.
17 ), the perovskite absorber in the control device is observed to undergo clear deterioration, yielding many impurity peaks after 530 h, whereas such changes are not observed in the DDT-treated devices. In the AFM results, the spiro-OMeTAD HTMs in control devices exhibit enlarged pinholes (Fig.
4c ) and cracks (Supplementary Fig.
18 ) after 530 h, but less morphological change is observed in the DDT-treated samples (Fig.
4d ). In the microscopic results, the spiro-OMeTAD HTMs in control devices are seen to have some crystallization (Fig.
4e ), but this is not observed in the DDT-treated samples (Fig.
4f ). From TOF-SIMS (Fig.
4g,h
and Supplementary Fig.
19 ), severe compositional interdiffusion between the HTM and perovskite is observed in the control device because of the poor resistance of the lithium compound and perovskite to water. In contrast, each functional layer maintains clear edges in the DDT-treated device. Thermal stability We investigated the impact of DDT on thermal stability by conducting thermal stress experiments (50–85 °C, open circuit, N 2
atmosphere and ambient light) on unencapsulated PSCs. Figure
5a
shows that there is an increase as large as 63% with respect to the peak PCE at 50 °C after 120 h for the best control device, agreeing with the reported degradation results in the literature 42 , 43 . In contrast, the best DDT-treated device has a high PCE retention of up to 95% over the same measurement period. We subsequently allowed the device temperature to rise to 85 °C and re-evaluated the device stability. We observed a faster degradation, with another 16% drop, for the control device after 24 h, whereas the DDT device shows a slower degradation with only another 5% drop. More test results on thermal stability are provided in Supplementary Table
11 . Fig. 5: The impact of DDT on thermal stability. a , Performance evolution of the most stable control and DDT-treated devices under thermal stress (50–85 °C, open circuit, N 2

The performances of the most stable control cell and DDT-treated cell are 20.2% and 20.3%, respectively, after air activation for 48 h. The thermal test then began immediately.

g , h , Corresponding TOF-SIMS depth profiles for the control cell ( g ) and DDT-treated cell ( h ). Full size image In XRD measurements (Fig.
5b ), no impurity peaks in either the control or the DDT-treated device are observed after 144 h, suggesting that the drop in performance is probably related to deterioration of the doped HTMs rather than the perovskite. This was confirmed by AFM, where we observe the formation of a crystalline fibril structure with valleys after 144 h in the control samples (Fig.
5c ). In comparison, DDT-treated films excel by largely retaining their initial morphological features, although with some enlarged pinholes (Fig.
5d ). In microscopy results (Fig.
5e,f ), the DDT film exhibits a suppressed crystalline coverage with smaller domain sizes. Crystallization of doped spiro-OMeTAD HTM films has a negative influence on device performance 44 , leading to decreased adhesive and cohesive fracture resistance 45
and the formation of an undesired layer that causes an energy barrier for charge extraction 46 . In the TOF-SIMS results (Fig.
5g,h
and Supplementary Fig.
20 ), the control device shows more Li +
and TFSI −
accumulation at the Au/HTM interface. Lithium cations have been reported to migrate into the perovskite stack via bulk or domain boundaries 13 , 18 . Contrastingly, the DDT-treated sample maintains overall good dopant homogeneity and higher concentration across the HTM. Capturing mobile lithium ions is critical for improving the thermal stability of HTMs 47 . We attribute the better results for capturing mobile lithium ions in DDT-treated samples to the strong interaction between DDT and the lithium compound. To confirm that the performance loss is arising mainly from the deteriorating HTM rather than the perovskite stack, we redeposited new doped spiro-OMeTAD HTMs on aged samples. The device performance could be recovered to ~19% (Supplementary Fig.
21 ). We also applied DDT-treated spiro-OMeTAD HTMs to FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3
PSCs. Thermally stable FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3
could avoid the degradation factor from the perovskite absorber 48 . Supplementary Fig.

further confirm the benefits of DDT for thermal stability. Illumination stability We investigated the impact of DDT on illumination stability by conducting continuous illumination stress experiments (AM 1.5, 30–35 °C, N 2
atmosphere, open-circuited, and SPO at MPP) on unencapsulated PSCs (Fig.
6a,b ). The best control device shows a decrease as large as 90% with respect to the peak performance after 2,000 h while open-circuited. In great contrast, the best DDT device has a high performance retention of up to 93% over the same measurement period. The DDT device also demonstrated a good stability result for SPO at MPP, retaining 90% of its peak performance after 1,000 h. More results on the light stability test are shown in Supplementary Table
13 . Continuous illumination deteriorates both the perovskite stack and the HTM in the control device, but the DDT-treated samples demonstrate improved stability. From XRD measurements (Fig.
6c ), the control devices are seen to exhibit a much stronger impurity peak (PbI 2 ) after 2,000 h than the DDT devices. The appearance of a PbI 2
peak could be ascribed to the loss of organic cations. Using AFM, small crystalline grains and valleys are observed for the control HTM after 2,000 h (Fig.
6d ), whereas most regions retain the initial amorphous characteristic in the DDT-treated sample, although with a few small crystalline grains on the surface (Fig.
6e ). Unlike the large crystalline domains caused by thermal stress, the crystalline grains caused by illumination stress are too tiny to be observed in the microscopy results. Nevertheless, apparent cracks can be observed for the control (Fig.
6f ), but not the DDT-treated sample (Fig.
6g ). Fig. 6: The impact of DDT on illumination stability. a , Performance evolution of the most stable control and DDT-treated devices under continuous illumination stress (1 sun, 30–35 °C, N 2

The performances of the most stable control cell and DDT-treated cell are 19.0% and 20.2%, respectively, after air activation for 48 h.

6h,i
and Supplementary Fig.
23 ), Li +
and TFSI −
ions are observed to accumulate severely at the interfaces in both control and DDT-treated devices. We notice the appearance of MA +
cations at the Au/spiro-OMeTAD interface after 2,000 h in the control devices, which can be ascribed to ion migration of MA +
from the perovskite to the Au contact via spiro-OMeTAD HTM; however, there is no MA +
cation signal in the DDT-treated sample. In contrast to DDT-treated HTM, the control spiro-OMeTAD HTM has more and larger pinholes (Fig.
1e,f ), which provide pathways for the migration/loss of volatile MA +
from the perovskite bulk under continuous illumination stress. Moreover, with increased time of illumination stress, severe crystallization and cracking issues start to appear in the control HTM (Fig.
6d,f ), providing more pathways for the migration/loss of volatile MA + . To confirm that the performance loss is not only from the deteriorated HTM but also from a degraded perovskite stack, we redeposited fresh spiro-OMeTAD HTMs on aged samples. The PCE of the control device recovered to only ~10% (Supplementary Fig.
24a ), suggesting that unrecoverable damage has occurred to the perovskite in the control sample. However, the efficiency of the DDT-treated device recovered to 19.2% (Supplementary Fig.
24b ). Broader context To evaluate the value of DDT in a broader context, we applied DDT to another popular lithium-doped poly-triarylamine (PTAA) precursor and observe improved performance for PTAA HTMs and their devices (Supplementary Figs.
25 – 28 ). We also applied DDT-treated spiro-OMeTAD HTMs to Sb 2 (S,Se) 3 ) solar cells. The devices employing DDT-treated spiro-OMeTAD HTMs demonstrated superior performance to those of control devices, as expected (Supplementary Table
14 ). Methods Materials PbI 2 , PbBr 2
and CsI were purchased from TCI. Formamidinium iodide (FAI), methylammonium bromide (MABr), methylammonium iodide (MAI) and methylammonium chloride (MACl) were purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp. SnCl 2 ·2H 2 O, thiourea, KCl,
N , N -dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), isopropanol (IPA),
t BP, chlorobenzene, acetonitrile, DDT, LiTFSI and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The spiro-OMeTAD was purchased from Lumtec Corp. PTAA was purchased from One Material Corp. Preparation of spiro-OMeTAD precursor solution The classic spiro-OMeTAD precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 72.5 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 28.5 µl
t BP and 17.5 µl lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide solution (520 mg ml −1
in acetonitrile) in 1 ml of chlorobenzene. DDT with different mole ratios to LiTFSI, including 0:1, 0.34:1, 0.7:1 and 1.4:1, was incorporated into the doped spiro-OMeTAD precursor, respectively. The optimal mole ratio of DDT/LiTFSI was 0.34:1. The spiro-OMeTAD precursor solutions were stirred in a glovebox overnight and filtered (0.22 μm, PTFE) before use. The spiro-OMeTAD films were fabricated on top of different substrates by spin coating at 4,500 r.p.m. for 30 s. Preparation of substrate ITO glass substrates were cleaned with a 2 vol% solution of Hellmanex cuvette-cleaning detergent, then washed with deionized water, and acetone, and dried with dry nitrogen. The substrates were treated with UV-ozone for 20 min before use. The SnO 2
electron-transport layer was fabricated as described in the literature 49 . The KCl passivation layer was fabricated as described in our previous work 50 , 51 . The RH in the lab was 50–65%. Preparation of perovskite precursor For the Cs 0.05 FA 0.81 MA 0.14 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
device, triple-cation perovskite precursor solution (1.25 M) was prepared by dissolving CsI, PbI 2
and PbBr 2 , FAI, and MABr in a DMF/DMSO mixture (vol/vol = 4/1). The perovskite precursor solutions were stirred in the glovebox and filtered (0.22 μm, PTFE) before spin-coating. For the Cs 0.05 FA x MA 1 −  x PbI 3
device, PbI 2
precursor solution (1.5 M) was prepared by dissolving PbI 2
in a DMF/DMSO mixture (vol/vol = 9/1) with the addition of CsCl (5 mol%). The PbI 2 –CsCl precursor solutions were stirred at 70 °C in the glovebox and filtered (0.22 μm, PTFE) before use. In parallel, we prepared organic cation precursor solution by dissolving 90 mg FAI, 6.4 mg MAI and 9 mg MACl in IPA. The organic cation precursor solutions were stirred in the glovebox and filtered (0.22 μm, PTFE) before spin-coating. Fabrication of PSCs The PSCs had an n–i–p structure: glass/ITO/SnO 2 /KCl/perovskite/PMMA/spiro-OMeTAD HTM/Au contact. For the Cs 0.05 FA 0.81 MA 0.14 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
device, we used ITO (transmittance, >84%; sheet resistivity, 6 Ω sq −1 ) as substrate. Perovskite films were deposited in the glovebox with anisole as the antisolvent. In detail, the perovskite precursor solution was dropped onto the SnO 2 /KCl substrates and spin-coated at 2,000 r.p.m. for 10 s and 4,000 r.p.m. for 20 s. We quickly dropped 250 μl of anhydrous anisole onto the substrates 10 s before the end of the program. The samples were immediately placed on a preheated hot plate and annealed at 100 °C for 45 min. For the Cs 0.05 FA x MA 1 −  x PbI 3
device, we used ITO (transmittance, >94%; sheet resistivity, 15 Ω sq −1 ) as substrate. The PbI 2 –CsCl precursor solution was spin-coated onto the SnO 2 /KCl substrates at 1,500 r.p.m. for 45 s, then annealed at 70 °C for 10 s. The organic cation precursor solution was then spin-coated onto the PbI 2 –CsCl at 2,000 r.p.m. for 30 s, followed by thermal annealing at 150 °C for 15 min in ambient air (RH, 20–30%). Sodium fluoride was incorporated into the devices for better results when undergoing continuous illumination measurements, as described in the literature 52 . A PMMA solution (1 mg ml −1
in chlorobenzene) was spin-coated onto the perovskite film as described in the literature 53 , 54 . The spiro-OMeTAD film was deposited on top of the perovskite film by spin coating at 4,500 r.p.m. for 30 s. The samples were then placed in a humidity-controlled box filled with air (RH, <10%, 25–30 °C, ambient light) for 48 h to ensure sufficient oxidation of the doped spiro-OMeTAD hole-transport layer before evaporation of the Au contact. A 100-nm layer of Au film was thermally evaporated as the contact electrode using a shadow mask. The mask temperature was above 50 °C at the end of the Au-contact evaporation because of thermal irradiation. Note that the moderate thermal irradiation during Au-contact evaporation is critical for inducing the coupling reaction between DDT molecules. Sn metal was soldered onto the ITO substrate before
J–V
measurements. To deposit fresh spiro-OMeTAD over aged devices after thermal and illumination stresses, we (1) peeled off the Au contact of completed cells using Kapton tape, (2) spun the samples at 2,000 r.p.m. while dropping 1 ml of chlorobenzene over the samples to wash away the aged spiro-OMeTAD films (three times), (3) dried the samples with N 2
gas and (4) dropped fresh spiro-OMeTAD precursor solution (72.5 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 28.5 µl
t BP and 17.5 µl LiTFSI solution (520 mg ml −1
in acetonitrile) in 1 ml of chlorobenzene) on top of the perovskite, followed by spin coating at 4,500 r.p.m. for 30 s. Characterizations Absorption spectra were obtained using an UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer (UV-3600 Plus). We peeled off the Au contact of completed cells using Kapton tape, dissolved the doped spiro-OMeTAD films using clean chlorobenzene, and then collected the corresponding solution for UV–vis absorption characterization. All samples were prepared and stored inside a N 2 -filled glovebox until characterization, without any intended aging in oxygen or in air. KPFM measurements were performed using a Si-coated Ti/Ir tip (work function of 4.27 eV as measured using a highly oriented graphite (HOPG) reference sample) with a 25-nm radius of curvature (ASYELEC.02, Oxford Instruments) as the probe, in non-contact mode with an a.c. voltage of −1 to +1 V. All KPFM measurements were performed immediately after the samples were fabricated, and all the measurements were performed in the dark in an enclosed N 2 -purging environment. For each sample, a 25-μm 2
sized map was obtained with a scan rate of 1 Hz and pixel density of 256 × 256. UPS measurements were carried out with an ESCALAB250Xi system (Thermo Scientific) in an ultrahigh-vacuum chamber with a base pressure of <2 × 10 −9  mbar. UPS was performed with the He I (21.22 eV) photon lines. Contact-angle measurements were conducted on a KRUSS Drop Shape Analyser-DSA25 with a drop of ultrapure water (1 µl). AFM was performed using a Bruker Multimode 8 microscope in tapping mode. 1 H NMR analysis was performed using a liquid-phase NMR system (Avance III 600-MHz NMR, Bruker). For NMR spectra, deuterated chlorobenzene- d 5
was used as the solvent, referenced to the residual proton from chlorobenzene- d 5
(calibrated at 6.96, 6.99 and 7.14 ppm). We use Kapton tape to peel off the Au contact of completed devices, dissolved the doped spiro-OMeTAD films using deuterated chlorobenzene, and then collected the corresponding solution for
1 H NMR tests. All samples were prepared and stored inside a N 2 -filled glovebox until characterization without any intended aging in oxygen or in air. Secondary electron images (SEMs) were recorded using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (NanoSEM 450). The cross-section SEM specimens were prepared by focused ion beam. Transmission FTIR spectroscopic analysis was performed using an FT/IR-6100 system (Jasco). TOF-SIMS (time-of-flight (TOF)-SIMS5ION-TOF) measurements were carried out to analyse the depth profile. A primary beam (Bi 3+ ) at 30 kV and sputter beam (Cs + ) at 1 kV were used for analysing positive and negative polarities. The PL spectra were measured using the back-scattering geometry with laser excitation of 405 nm and a thermoelectrically cooled Si-charge-coupled device detector. EIS was performed in the dark using an E4990A Impedance Analyzer from Keysight Technologies. The current density–voltage ( J–V ) measurements were performed in ambient air using a solar-cell
J–V
testing system from Abet Technologies (using a class AAA solar simulator) under an illumination power of 100 mW cm −2 . The devices were measured both in reverse scan (1.2 V to −0.1 V) and forward scan (−0.1 V to 1.2 V) with a scan rate of 0.1 V s −1 . When measuring cells fabricated via solvent engineering, a 0.16-cm 2
mask was used to define the accurate active-cell area. When measuring cells fabricated via sequential deposition, a 0.09-cm 2
mask was used to define the accurate active-cell area. The EQE measurements were performed using a QEX10 spectral response system from PV measurements. XRD patterns were measured using a PANalytical Xpert Materials Research diffractometer system with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ¼, 0.1541 nm).

Abstract Pseudo-halide (PH) anion engineering has emerged as a surface passivation strategy of interest for perovskite-based optoelectronics; but until now, PH anions have led to insufficient defect passivation and thus to undesired deep impurity states. The size of the chemical space of PH anions (>10 6
molecules) has so far limited attempts to explore the full family of candidate molecules. We created a machine learning workflow to speed up the discovery process using full-density functional theory calculations for training the model. The physics-informed machine learning model allowed us to pinpoint promising molecules with a head group that prevents lattice distortion and anti-site defect formation, and a tail group optimized for strong attachment to the surface. We identified 15 potential bifunctional PH anions with the ability to passivate both donors and acceptors, and through experimentation, discovered that sodium thioglycolate was the most effective passivant. This strategy resulted in a power-conversion efficiency of 24.56% with a high open-circuit voltage of 1.19 volts (24.04% National Renewable Energy Lab-certified quasi-steady-state) in inverted perovskite solar cells. Encapsulated devices maintained 96% of their initial power-conversion energy during 900 hours of one-sun operation at the maximum power point.

Main The optoelectronic properties of metal halide perovskite materials have enabled rapid progress in solar cell efficiency 1 . Further increases in power-conversion efficiency (PCE) require improved open-circuit voltage ( V OC ), as the short circuit current ( J SC ) is now close to the Shockley–Queisser limit 2 . The
V OC
of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is curtailed by non-radiative recombination arising due to surface and interfacial trap states. In addition, these defects accelerate PSC degradation, facilitating rapid halide-ion migration 3
and chemical reactions with water, oxygen and light 4 . Generally, perovskite compounds have a chemical formula ABX 3 , where ‘A’ is a monovalent cation, ‘B’ is a divalent cation and ‘X’ is a halide anion. Ammonium ligands (PEA + , BA + , F–PEA + , among others) 5 , 6
are now widely employed for passivation (Supplementary Table
1 ). However, this A-site passivation technique commonly demands delicate control over the dimensionality of the two-dimensional layer making up the two-dimensional:three-dimensional heterostructure. Furthermore, associated ligand intercalation has been documented to lead to degradation 7 , 8 . More recently, the use of pseudo-halide (PH) anions for X-site passivation has gained attention as it avoids the formation of lower-dimensional phases. X-site defects are more deleterious than A-site defects, motivating a focus onto their passivation 9 . However, only a few PH anions have been reported to work well in PSCs 10 , 11 , 12 , a trend that we posited could arise from inefficient passivation and the introduction of unwanted deep impurity states induced by PH anions. This led us to hypothesize that a full search of the associated chemical space could potentially uncover new and effective passivants, and thus harness the passivation potential of this diverse class of molecules in PSCs. We thus embarked on a systematic search for PH anions exhibiting strong binding to the perovskite surface, which we offer as a surrogate for the degree of passivation. To this, a further criterion was added: the anions should not introduce impurity states in the perovskites. Given the large chemical space, it would be impractical to rely on conventional trial-and-error. Instead we sought a route to study structure–property–performance relationships in a high throughput manner 13 , 14 , seeking to understand how the PH anion’s chemical structure influences its ability to passivate. Workflow for materials screening To accomplish this, we used density functional theory (DFT) on a subset of the chemical space and trained thusly a machine learning (ML) model (Fig.
1a ). First we screened the PH space for experimentally reasonable candidates. A multistep screening funnel considered the charge state (tier 1), molecular weight (tier 2), availability of three-dimensional structures (tier 3), molecular radii (tier 4), presence of Na or K salts (tier 5), and salt purchase availability (tier 6). The rationale for specific threshold values used in the materials screening procedure are discussed in Supplementary Note
1
and Supplementary Fig.
1 . Only 168 PH anions remained out of five million molecules derived from the PubChem database.

c , Formation energies (Δ E formation ) of the substitution versus adsorption mechanisms, as a function of the iodine chemical potential. The

of the adsorption mechanism was set as the reference (zero). 3D, three-dimensional. Full size image We investigated the interaction between PH anions and the perovskite surface (Fig.
1b ) using FA 0.75 MA 0.25 PbI 3
as a model system for investigation. The PH anions can interact with the perovskite surface via substitution, wherein the PH anion replaces an X (I − ) atom; or via adsorption through binding with under-coordinated B 2+
(Pb 2+ ) cations. From formation energies (Δ E formation ) (Fig.
1c ), we find that substitution is more thermodynamically favourable than adsorption in most I chemical potential (Δ μ I ) regions. This is attributed to the formation of more ionic bonds between Pb 2+
and the electron-rich group of PH anions, as well as more hydrogen bonds between NH 3 +
group of FA + /MA +
and PH anions. The charge density difference reveals charge transfer between PH anions at the surface and the perovskite slab, indicating that PH anions could attract electrons from neighbouring Pb and MA/FA atoms (Supplementary Fig.
2 ). In light of this understanding of the PH anion passivation mechanism, we performed DFT calculations to obtain estimates for the binding energies ( E b ) (Supplementary Fig.
3 ) of PH anions with the perovskite surface. As shown in Fig.
2a , several new PH anions have even higher
E b
than the 16 anions studied in earlier literature. The calculated
E b
trends in FA 0.75 MA 0.25 PbI 3
appear to extend well to other perovskite compositions, for example, FA 0.75 Cs 0.25 PbI 3
(normal bandgap), FA 0.75 MA 0.25 Pb 0.5 Sn 0.5 I 3
(narrow bandgap) and FA 0.75 Cs 0.25 Pb(I 0.625 Br 0.375 ) 3
(wide bandgap), as seen in Supplementary Fig.
4 . Since higher
E b
indicates stronger binding strength to iodine vacancies,
V I , we expect these candidates to offer enhanced passivation. Fig. 2: Determination of the ranking and chemical role of physical features that dominate binding energy performance of candidate PH anions. a , DFT-calculated

are the average and standard deviation of the ten-fold ROC AUC scores. Full size image Machine-learning-model training and analysis We then sought to develop a physics-informed machine learning (ML) model to investigate how the molecular structure of PH anions regulates their interaction strength with the perovskite surface. Screened PH anions have diverse electron-rich functional groups, including R–SO 3 − , R–SO 2 − , R–CO 2 − , R–COS − , R–S 2 O 2 − , R–CS 2 − , R–BF 3 − , PO 3 − , R–PO 2 − , R–PHO 3 − , R–S − , R–O − . Jeong et al. reported that the PH anion, formate (HCOO − ), had a binding energy of 3.1 eV, resulting in record-performing
n-i-p
(negative-intrinsic-positive) PSCs, while chloride (Cl − ) had a binding energy of 2.98 eV (ref.
10 ). In light of this, we used 3 eV as a basis to classify 267 PH anions, including our 168 screened p-h anions (Fig.
1a ), into high/low
E b : thus the PH anions are either labelled as higher
E b
(201 anions) or as lower
E b
(66 anions), and these are taken as the ML outputs. As shown in Fig.
2b , we initially considered 19 features of the PH anions as ML inputs (see
Methods
for ML details). After two rounds of ML training, we identify four primary features that influence the
E b
classification, including the number of oxygen atoms (num_O), topological polar surface area (TPSA), hydrogen bond acceptor count (HBA) and highest occupied molecular orbital levels (HOMO). Using these four features, we achieve a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under curve (AUC) score of 0.87 and an accuracy score of 0.84 in the random forest model (Fig.
2c , top panel, and Supplementary Fig.
5 ). In the logistic regression model, features with positive coefficients are beneficial for the positive label ('higher
E b ' class) (Fig.
2c
and Supplementary Figs.
6
and
7 ). We thus provide a set of guidelines for the binding energy determination: PH anions with more num_O, larger TPSA, more HBA and lower HOMO levels tend to exhibit stronger binding strength with the perovskite surface. Physically, a higher num_O provides more active sites to interact with Pb 2+
at the perovskite surface via coordination bonding. For example, we found that PH anions with SO 3 −
functional groups at the head-side tend to have higher binding energy than those with CO 2 −
functional groups. More HBA, defined as the sum of atoms in the molecule that contain lone electron pairs participating in the hydrogen bonding 15 , indicates increased likelihood to form hydrogen bonds between PH anions and the NH 3 +
group of FA + /MA. TPSA is also linked to the hydrogen bonding (both donor and acceptor groups) 15 . The HOMO levels are mostly situated on the electron-rich side, as shown by the red electrostatic potential (ESP) regions (Fig.
2b ). Lower HOMO levels usually indicate a higher electronegativity 16 , 17 , resulting in stronger electrostatic interaction between the PH anion and a positively charged defect (for example, V I ) on the perovskite surface. Thus, when we progress I − , Br − , Cl − , to F − , the increased electronegativity is accompanied by decreased
p -orbital energy levels, and stronger
E b
(Fig.
2a ). Bifunctional defect passivation mechanism We also sought to prevent deep impurity states caused by the PH treatment itself, as they increase non-radiative losses. This prompted us to look for safe functional groups: in the higher
E b
class ( E b  > 3 eV), we identify 24 potential PH anions (Figs.
2a
and
3d ) that did not produce localized states near the band edges, regardless of the calculation method level used (see detailed electronic structures in Supplementary Figs.

2a . S atoms, yellow; O atoms, red; Pb atoms, grey; I atoms, purple. Full size image The candidate molecules that emerged prompted us to look at the effect of functional groups on the formation of I Pb
anti-site defects (Fig.
3a ), known to lead to deep levels within the bandgap in (MA/FA)PbI 3
perovskites 18 , 19 . We found that SO 3 −
functional groups cause greater surface-structure distortion that inhibits the passivation of negatively charged I Pb
anti-site defects, while CO 2 −
prevents the formation of I Pb —but, as previously noted, has a lower surface binding strength. To overcome this undesirable trade-off, we explored bifunctional ligands: a head group (electron-rich side) with less surface-structure distortion and anti-site defect generation; and a tail (electron-poor side) engineered to increase binding affinity. In this work, we defined ‘bifunctional passivation’ as the ability to passivate both positively charged and negatively charged defects at perovskite surface. Specifically, the CO 2 −
functional group seemed a good choice for the head-side, providing less steric hindrance and reduced distortion; and either chalcogen- or halogen-containing functional groups for the tail to increase binding affinity. To evaluate candidate tail groups, we calculated the integrated crystal orbital Hamilton population (ICOHP) 20 , a measure of bonding strength. As shown in Fig.
3b , we found that those with the S atom at the tail-side forms a stronger coordination bond with Pb 2+
than do the other candidates (for example, O–Pb, Cl–Pb and F–Pb). A stronger bond suggests it would cost more energy to break the initial bonding to create I Pb
defects. Therefore, it appears that bifunctional PH anions can simultaneously fill donor-like defects V I , while also passivating acceptor-like defects (I Pb ). As shown in Fig.
3a , there are 15 PH anions having defect formation energies Δ E f  (I Pb ) > 0, which are considered as bifunctional ligands. We also sought to calculate the anion migration barrier (∆ E a ) at the perovskite surface, as halide migration is one cause of current–voltage hysteresis and decomposition of perovskite films 3 . As shown in Fig.
3c
and Supplementary Fig.
11 , ∆ E a
for I −
(vacancy mediated) is 0.23 eV (averaged), consistent with previous calculation results 21 . We find that Br − , Cl −
and F −
have an increased ∆ E a
of 0.27 eV, 0.32 eV and 0.37 eV, linked to enhanced electronegativity and binding strength with the perovskite surface (Fig.
2a ). The optimal bifunctional PH anions (ligand
14 ) further increase the ∆ E a
to 0.43 eV, the result of enhanced binding strength and the additional PH anion, FA + /MA +
molecular rotation barrier, the latter absent in halide (I − , Br − , Cl − ) migration. Photovoltaic performance of PSCs Experimentally, we took five bifunctional PH anions with higher
E b
for further investigation. We dissolved PH anion salts in a solution of isopropanol (IPA), which we spin coated on perovskite films at 0.5 mg ml −1
(Supplementary Fig.
12 ) and then annealed at 100 °C ( Methods ). We then fabricated inverted PSC devices without and with PH anion treatments (Fig.
4a ). We employed Cs 0.05 FA 0.9 MA 0.05 Pb(I 0.95 Br 0.05 ) 3
perovskite with a bandgap of 1.55 eV as the absorber. The PSCs had an inverted device architecture of ITO/NiO x /Me–4PACz/perovskite/C 60 /BCP/Ag, where ITO is indium tin oxide, Me–4PACz is [4-(3,6-dimethyl-9H-carbazol-9-yl)butyl]phosphonic acid, C 60
is fullerene and BCP is bathocuproine. In PSCs with an inverted ( p-i-n ) device structure, the interface between the perovskite layer and the electron transport layer (ETL) has been proven to be the most crucial to device performance due to substantial interfacial non-radiative recombination 22 , 23 . This motivated us to focus on the use of a PH anion passivation layer at the perovskite/ETL interface.

Full size image Figure
4b
shows the current density–voltage ( J–V ) curves for control versus five PH anion-treated devices under forward and reverse scanning. It reveals that sodium thioglycolate (ST) performed the best, though all five PH anions showed improved performance over controls. This we attributed to the optimal bifunctional passivation effect of thioglycolate. Both control and PH anion-treated devices exhibit low hysteresis. Figure
4c
shows device performance statistics using five different PH anion treatments (ST (ligand
14 ); sodium chlorate (SC) (ligand
2 ); potassium bicarbonate (PB) (ligand
7 ); sodium hydroxyacetate (SH) (ligand
13 ); and monosodium methylphosphonate (MMP) (ligand
12 )). We found that the
V OC
and PCE of these five PH anion-treated devices followed the order: ST best, SC worst, and SH, MMP and PB were in between. This sequence is consistent with the order of the calculated Δ E f  (I Pb ) of Fig.
3a : ST > SH > MMP > PB > SC. The role of sodium was discussed in Supplementary Note
3
and Supplementary Figs.
13
and
14 . In ST-treated devices,
V OC
and the fill factor (FF) were the basis of the improvement, with
J SC
remaining effectively unchanged.
V OC
improved from 1.14 V in control to 1.19 V in ST-treated devices and FF increased from 81.9% to 83.6% (see detailed photovoltaic (PV) parameters in Fig.
4b ). The ST-treated devices had a considerably higher stabilized power output of 24.2% compared with 22.5% for the controls (Supplementary Fig.
15 ). External quantum efficiency spectra (Supplementary Fig.
16 ) verified the
J SC
values obtained from the
J–V
measurements. We fabricated 15 ST-treated PSCs and the narrow PCE distribution indicates good reproducibility (statistics in Fig.
4c ). An ST-treated device was certified at an independent institute, National Renewable Energy Lab, and achieved a quasi-steady-state PCE of 24.04% ( V OC  = 1.16 V,
J SC  = 25.12 mA cm −2
and FF = 82.48%) (Supplementary Fig.
17 ). This efficiency ranks amongst the best reported in the literature for inverted PSCs (Supplementary Table
1 ). Next, we sought to characterize the morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite films to reveal the interaction between the perovskite and the PH anion treatments. Top down and cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that the film morphology remains unchanged after the PH anion treatments (Supplementary Figs.
13
and
20 ). The PH anion treatments did not affect overall crystallinity and perovskite phase, with no erroneous peaks, and lack of correlative peak shifting, broadening, or intensity differences, as evidenced by indexed thin-film and simulated X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Supplementary Figs.
18
and
19 ). Additionally, ST and MMP treatments are found to reduce excess PbI 2 , an added benefit for stability (Fig.
5a
and Supplementary Fig.
18 ). The impact of posttreatment recrystallization on the morphology of perovskite thin films was discussed in Supplementary Note
4
and Supplementary Figs.

and

peak (Fig.
5b ) and S 2 p
peak (Fig.
5c ) suggest that PH anions anchor at the perovskite film surface. Upon ST treatment, a binding energy shift of 0.24 eV and 0.34 eV was observed for the Pb 4 f 5/2
and Pb 4 f 7/2
orbitals, respectively, indicating a strong interaction between the PH anion and the perovskite surface (Fig.
5d ). We provide detailed C, S, Pb, O, Na, N, I and Cs XPS spectra for all five PH anions (ST, SH, MMP, PB and SC) in Supplementary Fig.
22 . In addition, we performed sputtering XPS ( Methods ) on control and ST-treated samples to evaluate the penetration depth of the PH treatment (Supplementary Fig.
23 ) and our results indicate that the thioglycolate anion remained within 5 nm of the perovskite surface, as evidenced by the S 2 p
peak (Supplementary Note
5 ). To investigate if the thioglycolate treatment leads to defect passivation, we compared the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) of control and ST-treated films. For the PL measurements, we used a glass/perovskite/PH treatment architecture. The PL emission intensity of the ST-treated film was more than three times higher than that of the control sample (Fig.
5e ), indicating that the PH anion treatment reduces non-radiative recombination in perovskite films. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), on average, increased from 20% to 44% upon ST treatment (Supplementary Fig.
24 ), while the remaining PH treatments all exhibited a higher average PLQY over the control (Supplementary Fig.
14 ). We anticipated that the average bulk quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) will rise from 1.23 to 1.26 eV after ST treatment ( Methods ). The
V OC
increase (from 1.14 V to 1.19 V) in ST-treated devices is consistent with their increased PLQY. Furthermore, applying the ST PH treatment to a different perovskite composition, namely a narrow-bandgap Cs 0.05 FA 0.7 MA 0.25 Pb 0.5 Sn 0.5 I 3 , was found to result in the highest PLQY over the control and other PH anions (Supplementary Fig.
25 ), hinting at wider applicability of bifunctional PH anions. We investigated the long-term operational stability of ST-treated PSC devices under 1-sun-equivalent light-emitting diode (LED) illumination after confirming sufficient longevity under AM1.5 G standards (Supplementary Note
6
and Supplementary Fig.
26 ). These encapsulated devices were biased with fixed resistance loads near the maximum power point (MPP). The ST-treated device retains 96% of its initial PCE after a period of 900 hours (Fig.
5f
and Supplementary Fig.
27 ). The loss in PCE is primarily due to a decrease in current density, whereas the voltage showed little degradation (Supplementary Figs.
28
and
29 ). The MPP tracking findings are consistent with a picture of mitigated ion migration at the perovskite surface (Fig.
3c ) and the reduction of PbI 2
in thin-film XRD (Fig.
5a ). The present study suggests that continued progress in combined computational, ML and experimental efforts has further potential for the discovery of molecular strategies to increase performance in optoelectronics, including photovoltaics, as well as in related light-emitting devices. Methods Computational details We used the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) 24
to perform DFT-based first-principles calculations. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional 25
and the screened Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof hybrid functional 26 , 27
were used for the exchange-correlation functional. DFT-D3 method was used for the van der Waals correction 28 . The spin orbital coupling (SOC) effect was included in electronic structure calculations. In Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof + spin orbital coupling calculations, the mixing parameter ( α ) of the Hartree–Fock term was set to 0.45, which had been proven to reproduce the experimental bandgap. We used the cutoff energy of 400 eV with the energy and force convergence tolerance setting to 10 −5
eV and 0.03 eV Å −1 , respectively. The Brillouin zone was sampled with Γ-centred
k -mesh densities of 2π × 0.04 Å −1 . For the chemical bond analysis, we used the LOBSTER program 29
to calculate the ICOHP 20 , a quantitative measure of bond strength. We employed Climbing Image Nudged Elastic Band method 30
to calculate the ion migration barrier (∆ E a ) at the perovskite surface. Machine learning We initially considered 19 features of PH anions as ML inputs: (1) electronic parameters calculated by Gaussian such as lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, HOMO, minimum electrostatic potential and maximum electrostatic potential; (2) structural parameters such as ionic radius ( R ), length ( L a ), breadths ( L b ), heights ( L c ), molecular polarity index (MPI) and number of elemental species (num_O, num_S, num_F, num_P, num_B, num_C); and (3) fundamental parameters obtained from the Pubchem database such as molecular weight, TPSA, HBA and complexity. We obtained the data of lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, HOMO, minimum electrostatic potential, maximum electrostatic potential,
R ,
L a ,
L b ,
L c
and MPI by postprocessing using the Multiwfn software 31 . As evidenced by the correlation matrix of continuous features (Supplementary Fig.
30 ), we abandon two highly correlated features (MPI and
L a ) in the first-round ML training. On the basis of input features, we trained and evaluated five different classification ML models, including the random forest model, the gradient boosting classifier model, the XGboost model, the logistic regression model and the support-vector classifier model. The motivations behind choosing classification over regression were discussed in Supplementary Note
7
and Supplementary Fig.
31 . We set aside 15% of the dataset as a test set, with the rest used as the training set. To avoid overfitting, we selected the ML model hyperparameter using StratifiedShuffleSplit with n_splits = 10 for cross-validation. We also considered regularization in the logistic regression model. We used the ROC AUC score and accuracy score as the evaluation metrics. As listed in Supplementary Table
2 , the difference in ROC AUC and accuracy scores between the training and test tests was small, indicating a low likelihood of overfitting. We used the codes from Guo et al. to plot the ROC curves 32 . Materials All materials were used as received without further purification. The organic halide salts (FAI, MABr) were purchased from GreatCell Solar Materials. PbI 2
(99.99%), PbBr 2
(99.999%) and [4-(3,6-dimethyl-9H-carbazol-9-yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Me–4PACz) were purchased from TCI Chemicals. CsI (99.999%), SC, PB, SH, ST, MMP and nickel nitrate hexahydrate were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. C 60 , Bathocuproine (BCP) were purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp. All the solvents used in the process were anhydrous and purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. Perovskite film and device fabrication NiO x
nanocrystal (10 mg ml −1 ) layers were first spin coated on ITO substrates at 3,000 r.p.m. for 25 s in air without any posttreatment, then the substrates were immediately transferred to the glovebox. The NiO x
nanoparticles were synthesized via the hydrolysis reaction of nickel nitrate referring to our previous work 33 . Me–4PACz (0.3 mg ml −1 ) in ethanol was spin coated on the NiO x
film at 3,000 r.p.m. for 25 s and then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. We opted to construct a NiO x –Me–4PACz hole transport layer due to the well-documented ability of Me–4PACz to improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs 34 , while NiO x
acts to improving the wettability of perovskite on the self-assembled monolayer. Perovskite precursor solution (1.5 M, Cs 0.05 FA 0.9 MA 0.05 Pb(I 0.95 Br 0.05 ) 3 ) was prepared by dissolving the PbI 2 , PbBr 2 , MABr, CsI, and FAI in a mixture of solvents DMF and DMSO at a volume ratio of 4:1. For the perovskite film fabrication, the substrate was spun at 2,000 r.p.m. for 35 s with an acceleration of 1,000 r.p.m. per second at first, and then at 7,000 r.p.m. for the 10 s with an acceleration of 7,000 r.p.m. per second. In the second step, 150 μl Anisole was dropped onto the substrate during the last 5 s of the spinning. The substrate was immediately placed on a hotplate and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. For the posttreatment, the ligands were dissolved in IPA solution with concentration of 0.5 mg ml −1 , the surface treatment was finished by depositing 130 µl organic salts solution onto the perovskite film surface at a spin rate of 4,000 r.p.m. for 25 seconds with a 1,000-r.p.m. per second acceleration. The film was then annealed at 100 °C for 5 min to remove any residual IPA. After cooling to room temperature, the substrates were transferred to the evaporation system, 20 nm C 60 , 8 nm BCP and 140 nm Ag were subsequently deposited by thermal evaporation. For PSCs used in MPP tracking, 8 nm of BCP was replaced with 20 nm of atomic-layer-deposited tin(IV) oxide (ALD-SnO 2 ) to limit environmentally induced degradation (Supplementary Note
8 ). Deposition of the ALD-SnO 2
was carried out using a PICOSUN R-200 Advanced ALD system. Water and tetrakis(dimethylamino)tin(IV) were used as the oxygen and tin precursors, respectively. The precursor and substrate temperature were set to 75 °C and 85 °C, respectively. Nitrogen gas (90 sccm) was used as carrier gas. The pulse and purge times for water were 1 s and 5 s, respectively, while for tetrakis(dimethylamino)tin(IV), they were 1.6 s and 5 s, respectively. The total number of cycles is 134, corresponding to 20 nm of SnO 2 . Device test The current density–voltage ( J – V ) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under illumination from a solar simulator (Newport, Class A) with a light intensity of 100 S5 mW cm −2
(checked with a calibrated reference solar cell from Newport).
J – V
curves were measured in a nitrogen atmosphere with a scanning rate of 100 mV s −1
(voltage step of 10 mV and delay time of 200 ms). The active area was determined by the aperture shade mask (0.049 cm 2
for small-area devices) placed in front of the solar cell. A spectral mismatch factor of 1 was used for all
J – V
measurements. We verified the effect of our champion passivator, ST, on the performance of PSCs at an independent third-party laboratory (Supplementary Note
9
and Supplementary Fig.
32 ). Stability tests of solar cells The stability tracking depicted in Fig.
5f
is carried out under simulated 1-sun conditions utilizing a homemade white-light LED tracker. The intensity of the white-light LED tracker is calibrated to match 1-sun conditions. In contrast, the stability tracking in Supplementary Fig.
26
is conducted under AM1.5 G illumination, a multicolour LED solar simulator, with an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm −2 . The spectra of the LED simulators used in Fig.
5f
and Supplementary Fig.
26
are presented in Supplementary Fig.
33
and Supplementary Fig.
34 , respectively. In both setups, the device chamber was sealed and purged with nitrogen during room temperature tests (ISOS-L-1I) and MPP was monitored using a perturb and observe algorithm that updated the MPP point every 10 s. The devices were encapsulated by placing a glass slide on top and securing it with UV-adhesive (Lumtec LT-U001). PLQY measurements and QFLS calculation The excitation source was an unfocused beam of a 405 nm continuous-wave diode laser. Photoluminescence was collected using an integrating sphere with a precalibrated fibre coupled to a spectrometer (Ocean Optics QE Pro) with an intensity of ~100 mW cm −2 . PLQY values were calculated by PLQY =  P S /( P Ex   ⨉   A ), where
A  = 1  −   P L  /  P Ex ,
P S
is the integrated photon count of sample emission upon laser excitation;
P Ex
is the integrated photon count of the excitation laser when the sample is removed from integrating sphere, and
P L
is the integrated photon count of excitation laser when sample is mounted in the integrating sphere and hit by the beam. A set of neutral density filters were used to vary the excitation density to correspond to 1-sun illumination. QFLS is calculated by the PLQY values at various excitation light intensities, in this instance, just 1-sun excitation intensity was used: QFLS =  k B T   ⨉  ln(PLQY  ⨉   S   ⨉   J G  /  J 0,rad ) where
k B is the Boltzmann constant,
T
is temperature,
S
is sun-equivalent excitation intensity,
J G
the generated current density at 1 sun (taken from device
J sc ) and
J 0,rad
the radiative recombination current in the dark (taken from the dark current value from Shockley–Queisser limit). The detailed parameters for calculating QFLS from PLQY are provided in Supplementary Note
10 . XPS measurements The high resolution XPS was performed by Nexsa G2 X-Ray Photoelectron Spectrometer System with a monochromated, micro-focused, and low-power Al K-Alpha X-ray source and an X-ray spot size of 200 um. The pass energy for the measurement is 50 eV. Vertical sputtering/profiling was performed using 1 keV Ar +
ions (monatomic mode) with a raster size of 2 mm, resulting in a sputtering rate of roughly 0.57 nm s − 1 . A single sputtering cycle lasted 10 seconds, at which point the sputtering crater was probed. This was repeated for a total of seven cycles.

Abstract The fabrication of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in ambient air can accelerate their industrialization. However, moisture induces severe decomposition of the perovskite layer, limiting the device efficiency. Here we show that sites near vacancy defects absorb water molecules and trigger the hydration of the perovskite, eventually leading to the degradation of the material. We demonstrate that guanabenz acetate salt eliminates both cation and anion vacancies, blocking the perovskite hydration and allowing the crystallization of a high-quality film in ambient air. With guanabenz acetate salt, we prepare PSCs in ambient air with a certified efficiency of 25.08%. The PSCs without encapsulation maintain around 96% of their initial efficiency after 2,000 hours of ageing in ambient air and after 500 hours of operating at the maximum power point under simulated air mass (AM) 1.5 G solar light in a N 2
atmosphere. The encapsulated devices retained 85% of their initial efficiency after 300 hours under damp heat conditions (85 °C and 85% relative humidity).

Main Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much research attention as a tremendous potential photovoltaic technology, with their power conversion efficiency (PCE) now exceeding 25.8% (refs.
1 , 2 ). Massive efforts—crystallization regulation, defect passivation and interface and structure design—have been devoted to improving the efficiency and stability of PSCs 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 . However, the fabrication of these >25% efficient and stable PSCs requires an inert atmosphere (for example, nitrogen glovebox) 12 , 13 , 14 , which restricts their large-scale production and practical applications. Therefore, the fabrication of high-performance PSCs in ambient air is expected to promote their practical applications and low-cost commercialization. Unfortunately, lead halide perovskite is extremely sensitive to moisture in ambient air, which can lead to initial hydration, followed by disruptive phase transitions, destruction of the crystal framework and decomposition 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 . Hence, the fabrication of highly efficient PSCs is strictly limited to a glovebox; thus, it is difficult to fabricate them in a scaled and industrialized fashion. The space expansion of a glovebox is intractable from technical and economic perspectives. In an effort to obtain high-efficiency PSCs independent of the inert atmosphere, researchers have adapted the fabrication of PSCs to various environmental conditions 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 . The additive strategy 25 , 26
is a valid approach to optimizing perovskite crystallization and preventing moisture vulnerability in ambient air, such as 19.4% efficient PSCs enabled via PbS quantum dots at 40–60% relative humidity (RH) 26 . Antisolvent engineering and environmental condition control in the deposition process can also reduce the moisture impacts and accelerate perovskite crystallization, promoting PSCs with efficiencies exceeding 22% at 50–70% RH 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 . Remarkably, the use of ionic liquids 4 , 31 , 32
is proposed to obtain stable perovskite in ambient air; the ionic liquids induce vertical lead iodide to achieve a fast transformation to stable α-FAPbI 3
and can produce PSCs with an efficiency of 24.1% at 80% RH 4 . However, an approach to truly throw off the impact of moisture on the fabrication of PSCs to obtain an efficiency of over 25% in ambient air is lacking. We aim to design a strategy that focuses on the first stage of perovskite hydration to protect the perovskite from water. Hydration is generated more easily near the vacancy sites located on the perovskite surface and grain boundary, which can drastically accelerate the moisture-induced decomposition of perovskite films 33 , 34 . Hence, eliminating the vacancies is a feasible approach to decreasing the perovskite sensitivity to water. The cation vacancies can be effectively filled by an organic group, which possesses suitable charges and a similar molecular size to formamidinium ions (FA + ) 35 , 36 . In addition, pseudohalide anions with strong electronegativities, such as HCOO −
and CH 3 COO − , cannot only suppress anion-vacancy defects but also augment the crystallinity of films 14 . On the basis of the above analysis, guanabenz acetate salt (GBA) should be a suitable material; its structure includes acetate (AC − ) and guanidine groups, which theoretically can suppress both cation and anion vacancies and synergistically optimize crystallization. GBA also includes a benzene ring that possesses a high electron cloud density to passivate perovskite neutral defects and a concrete molecular structure to maintain the guanidine group anchoring on the perovskite surface and grain boundary 37 . Here we report highly efficient PSCs fabricated fully in ambient air by blocking the hydration pathway of perovskite at the source using GBA. GBA significantly eliminates the vacancy and increases the binding energy of perovskite with H 2 O, removing the detrimental interference of moisture on perovskite crystallization. The resulting PSCs obtained an efficiency of 25.32% (certified 25.08%) with an aperture area of 0.08 cm 2
and maintained 97% of the initial PCE after 2,000 hours of ageing in ambient air without encapsulation. The unencapsulated PSCs retained 96% of the initial PCE after maximum power point (MPP) tracking under continuous illumination ( ~ 50 °C) in N 2
atmosphere for 500 hours. Moreover, the encapsulated PSCs exhibited excellent stability under damp heat tests (85 °C and 85% RH). These PSCs retained 85% of their original PCE values after 300 hours of testing at 85% RH. Characterization of perovskite films fabricated in air We deposited perovskite films in various humid atmospheres, and distinctive phenomena in structural and photoelectric properties with and without GBA (Supplementary Fig.  1
shows the chemical structure) were demonstrated. The quality of control perovskite films containing no GBA becomes very poor without inert atmosphere protection; this finding was confirmed by the morphology and crystallinity results (via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIXRD)). In the control film, the number of pinholes and PbI 2
on the surface increases with increasing humidity (Fig.  1a
and Supplementary Fig.  2 ), which is consistent with previous reports 22 . Figure  1b,c
shows the 2D GIXRD ring patterns and the corresponding 1D integral spectra of the control films, respectively. When the deposition of perovskite films is exposed to moisture, the signal of the wide-bandgap yellow phase (δ-FAPbI 3 ) begins to be captured, and the integrated intensity of the α-FAPbI 3
peak located near 14° decreases. Additionally, the increase in humidity causes a shift of the peak in the 1D integral spectra, which indicates that the perovskite structure distortion is impacted by moisture. These undesirable structural deviations are worsened with increasing humidity, suggesting the adverse impacts of moisture on the crystallinity of perovskite, which impedes the formation of ideal α-FAPbI 3
and induces composition segregation 14 , 18 . Fig. 1: Morphology and crystallinity characterization of perovskite films. a – f , Both control and target films are fabricated under different humidities (0–80% RH).

are the position of α-(100) phase. Full size image In contrast to the control films, the target films exhibit excellent quality even when their deposition process is exposed to moisture (incorporated 3% GBA). Their surface morphology shows no evident difference with increasing humidity (Fig.  1d ). The film deposited under ~80% RH (~20 °C) in ambient air still possesses a pinhole-free and dense characteristic. In Fig.  1e,f , the integrated intensity of the α-FAPbI 3
peak can maintain a remarkable consistency under different humidities, and distortion of the perovskite structure was prevented. The formation of δ-FAPbI 3
is completely inhibited by incorporating GBA, even in ambient humidity as high as 80% RH. In addition, the intensity of the PbI 2
peak in the target perovskite XRD image is decreased compared with that of the control film (Supplementary Fig.  3
and Supplementary Note  1 ). These ideal film properties confirm that GBA can protect crystallization from moisture in ambient air, resulting in compact and α-FAPbI 3 -preferred perovskite films. We also evaluated the photoelectric property differences of perovskite films deposited in ambient air in terms of spatial uniformity and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Notably, the following control and target samples were prepared in ambient air under ~55% RH (~20 °C) unless specified. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurements were carried out to examine the surface potential of the films (Fig.  2a,b
and Supplementary Fig.  4 ). The target film exhibits a higher potential than the control film, which could be attributed to the decreased surface electronic trap density 38 . The increase in surface potential is consistent with the ultraviolet photoelectron spectrometer results (Supplementary Figs.  5
and
6
and Supplementary Note  2 ). Additionally, the potential distribution of the target film is ~33 mV, which is smaller than that of the control film (~48 mV). From the photoluminescence (PL) images of both films, the target film clearly exhibits an enhanced PL intensity compared to that of the control film (Fig.  2c,d
and Supplementary Fig.  7 ). Specifically, the PL intensity distribution in the target film is more spatially uniform than that in the control film, which is consistent with the KPFM results. The uniform distribution of potential and PL intensity indicates that the incorporated GBA improves the quality of perovskite films.

f , TRPL spectra of control and target films.
g , In situ optical microscopy images of morphology evolution under continuous water spray of control and target perovskite films. Full size image The photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) was measured to quantitatively evaluate the luminous efficiencies of both films deposited in ambient air (Fig.  2e ). The PLQE of the control film is 3.64 ± 2.14%, while the target film exhibits a significantly increased PLQE of 17.90 ± 1.49%, demonstrating its superior radiative ability after incorporating GBA. The carrier lifetime from time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) of the target film is prolonged from 0.77 μs to 2.26 μs (Fig.  2f ), indicating fewer trap states. In short, these remarkable structural and photoelectric phenomena verify that the incorporated GBA can decrease the sensitivity of perovskite crystallization to moisture, ensuring the formation of a high-quality perovskite film deposited in ambient air. To visually observe the decreased moisture sensitivity of the target film, water-soaking tests were conducted. The decomposition process under continuous spray soaking of perovskite films was observed in situ under an optical microscope (Fig.  2g ). The control and target films show an apparent decomposition difference in the time response. The control film degrades immediately under spray soaking, while the target film can maintain stability for up to 24 s, suggesting the moisture insensitivity resulting from the use of GBA. Additionally, harsher water dropping and immersing tests were carried out (Supplementary Figs.  8
and
9 ). When contacting the water, the control film shows a colour change from black to yellow within 3 s, while the target film can maintain the black colour for over 15 s, which is consistent with the results from the spray soaking tests. Subsequently, we performed a contact angle test, and the results showed that the control and target films had similar water drop contact angles (Supplementary Fig.  10 ). According to the contact angle tests, the reason for decreased moisture sensitivity of the target film is not supposed to be forming a hydrophobic surface. Considering the improved photoelectric property of the target film, we speculate that the decreased moisture sensitivity may be closely relevant to the eliminated vacancy that is reported to mainly exist in the grain boundary and surface 39 , 40
(Supplementary Figs.  11
and
12
and Supplementary Note  3 ). Confirmation of hydration blocking The reason for the high-quality perovskite film achieved in ambient air was examined; GBA blocks the hydration pathway, that is, the initial interaction stage between moisture and perovskite. Initially, the mechanism of moisture-induced decomposition was analysed (Fig.  3a , left). An atom exposed by a vacancy in perovskite can bind with H 2 O molecules more easily in energetics 16 , 33 , 34 , 39 , 40 , which is the beginning of the hydration process. The subsequent process induces the escape of the FAI and collapse of the Pb 2 I 6 2−
framework 19 , 41 . To investigate the dominant impact of vacancies on hydration, density functional theory (DFT) studies were carried out to calculate the binding energy of H 2 O molecules with the perovskite (Fig.  3b
and Supplementary Table  1 ). I −
and FA +
vacancies are readily formed during film deposition 15 . When there is a FA +
vacancy in the structure (Supplementary Fig.  13 ), the binding energies of H 2 O molecules with FA + , Pb 2+
and I −
are −1.134 eV, −1.133 eV and −1.461 eV, respectively. When there is an I −
vacancy (Supplementary Fig.  14 ), the binding energies of H 2 O with FA + , Pb 2+
and I −
are −1.450 eV, −0.610 eV and −1.189 eV, respectively. Conversely, in an ideal perovskite structure (Supplementary Fig.  15 ), the binding energies of H 2 O molecules with FA + , Pb 2+
and I −
are 1.020 eV, 1.446 eV and 1.774 eV, respectively. These results indicate that H 2 O molecules can be favourably absorbed near vacancy sites and induce perovskite decomposition, which suggests that eliminating vacancies is a feasible approach to decreasing the sensitivity of perovskites to moisture.

approaches when the structure incorporated GBA. Full size image GBA can eliminate vacancies through interaction with perovskite (Fig.  3a , right). GBA is an aromatic amine salt, including AC − , which possesses strong coordination ability, and a terminated guanidine group in the benzene ring, which forms a greater number of effective hydrogen bonds than FA + 42 . From the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of GBA and the target film (Fig.  3c ), both the corresponding absorption peaks of C = O and C–O of GBA shift to a lower wavenumber after being incorporated into the perovskite film, implying that an interaction occurred between GBA and perovskite 43 . Specifically, the evident downshift of Pb 4 f
core levels in the target film also confirms the above interaction (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Fig.  3d , Supplementary Fig.  16
and Supplementary Note  4 ), indicating that GBA can fill the I −
vacancy through binding with the unsaturated Pb 2+ 44 . Additionally, the smaller binding energy of Pb 2+ -AC −
demonstrates that the unsaturated Pb 2+
will preferentially connect with AC −
through a stronger Pb–O bond rather than the H 2 O molecule upon comparison of the binding energies of Pb 2+ -AC − (−2.401 eV) and Pb 2+ -H 2 O (−0.610 eV) when I −
vacancies are present (Supplementary Fig.  17
and Supplementary Table  2 ). Additionally, it was speculated that the FA +
vacancy was filled by the terminated guanidine group of GBA based on the formed hydrogen bond and energetic stability calculation. The I 3 d
core levels of the target film exhibited a downshift (Supplementary Fig.  18 ), implying the I −
vacancy was filled by AC −
and the formation of a hydrogen bond between the terminated guanidine group of GBA and the I atom 41 . In addition, the terminated guanidine group of GBA interacted with the PbI 2
film substrate through a hydrogen bond, which was also confirmed by the shift of C = N in the PbI 2
film-incorporated GBA (Supplementary Fig.  19 ) 35 . From the view of energetics, after the terminated guanidine filled the FA +
vacancy, the DFT calculation showed that I −
vacancy formation was suppressed by 0.28 eV (Supplementary Fig.  20
and Supplementary Note  5 ), resulting in a stable perovskite lattice 33 . To verify that the incorporated GBA eliminates both I −
and FA +
vacancies in perovskite, we carried out deep energy level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) measurements (Fig.  3e ). The DLTS signals of the control film exhibited two peaks marked with T1 and T2, indicating two types of dominant traps. The Arrhenius plots were fitted (Fig.  3f ) to calculate the activation energy of the corresponding traps according to the following Arrhenius equation: $$\mathrm{ln}({{{t}}}_{{\rm{au}}}\times {{{V}}}_{{\rm{th}}}\times {{{N}}}_{{\rm{c}}})=\frac{{{{E}}}_{{\rm{T}}}-{{{E}}}_{{\rm{V}}}}{{{KT}}}-\,\mathrm{ln}({{{X}}}_{{\rm{P}}}{\sigma }_{{\rm{P}}})$$ where

vacancy and I −
vacancy in the control film, respectively 45 , 46 . Remarkably, the DLTS signals of the target film did not exhibit any trap peaks, indicating that the incorporated GBA effectively eliminated the vacancy. The decreased trap density resulting from the GBA was also confirmed by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements (Supplementary Figs.  21
and
22
and Supplementary Note  6 ). In addition, we calculated the carrier mobility and diffusion length of the control and target films. The results showed that the carrier mobility and diffusion length of the target films increased from 1.98 cm 2  V −1  s −1
and 1.96 μm to 2.68 cm 2  V −1  s −1
and 3.92 μm, respectively (Supplementary Table  3
and Supplementary Note  7 ). The effects of the decreased moisture sensitivity of perovskite due to the elimination of vacancies by GBA were investigated. On the basis of the I −
vacancy and FA +
vacancy filled by the AC −
and terminated guanidine groups of GBA, respectively, we calculated the binding energies of H 2 O molecules with FA + , Pb 2+
and I −
to be 0.790 eV, 0.373 eV and 0.475 eV, respectively (Fig.  3g , Supplementary Fig.  23
and Supplementary Table  1 ). After incorporating GBA, the binding energy of H 2 O molecules with the perovskite transformed from negative (Fig.  3b ) to positive (Fig.  3g ), implying harder to bind. The positive value would indicate that the interaction of H 2 O molecules with the perovskite was not spontaneous or immediate. Hence, the intercepted perovskite hydration by GBA could effectively protect the perovskite crystallization from moisture, ensuring the deposition of high-quality perovskite films for fabricating efficient PSCs in ambient air (Fig.  3a ). Performance of PSCs fabricated in ambient air We utilized high-quality perovskite films that incorporated GBA further to fabricate PSCs (FTO/c-TiO 2 /FA 0.98 MA 0.02 PbI 3 /o-F-PEAI/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au) in ambient air. After exploring the influence of the GBA concentration on the PCE of PSCs (Supplementary Fig.  24
and Supplementary Table  4 ), we determined that the optimal concentration was 0.045 M (the molar ratio of GBA/PbI 2
is 3%). Figure  4a
displays the current density–voltage ( J – V ) curves (reverse) of the champion control and target PSCs, in which the aperture area is 0.08 cm 2 . The target PSCs reach a PCE of 25.32% with low hysteresis, while the PCE of the control PSCs is 23.13% (Supplementary Fig.  25
and Supplementary Table  5 ). Specifically, the target PSCs exhibit an open voltage ( V OC ) of 1.174 V, which is much higher than that (1.141 V) of control PSCs. The stabilized PCE of the target PSCs is 25.03%, measured at the maximum power point (Supplementary Fig.  25 ). The corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the control and target PSCs are shown in Fig.  4b , in which the value of integrated short-circuit current density ( J SC ) is basically consistent with that obtained from the
J – V
curves. The target PSCs also possess satisfactory reproducibility with an average PCE of 24.71% (Fig.  4c
and Supplementary Fig.  26 ). One of the best performing target PSCs was certified by an independent solar cell-accredited laboratory (National Institute of Metrology, China) and achieved a PCE of 25.08% (Supplementary Fig.  27 ). We directly compared reported PSCs fabricated fully in ambient air with those in our work (Supplementary Fig.  28
and Supplementary Table  6 ) and showed that the PCE of 25.32% obtained in our work significantly promoted the advances of ambient air-fabricated PSCs. Fig. 4: Photovoltaic performance of control and target PSCs. a ,

The horizontal dashed line is the 85% of initial PCE. The initial photovoltaic parameters of the control and target PSCs in the stability test were listed in Supplementary Table  9 . Full size image The incorporated GBA ensures a uniform perovskite film deposited in ambient air, which is further used to fabricate PSCs with an aperture area of 1 cm 2
(Fig.  4d ). On the basis of the same composition and device structure, the control PSCs exhibit a PCE of 20.37%, with a
J SC
of 25.20 mA cm − 2 , a
V OC
of 1.148 V and a fill factor of 71.23%. In contrast, the PCE of the target PSCs improved to 22.62%, with a
J SC
of 25.43 mA cm − 2 , a
V OC
of 1.161 V and the fill factor increased to 76.60% (Supplementary Fig.  29
and Supplementary Table  7 ). The effectively improved performance in large-area PSCs indicates the further potential of our work in scalable industrialization. It has been reported that there are various types and amounts of defect in different perovskite components 47 , 48 . To verify the expandability of GBA in improving the performance of other perovskites, we also fabricated PSCs (FTO/c-TiO 2 /MA 0.75 FA 0.25 PbI 3 /o-F-PEAI/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au, the aperture area is 0.08 cm 2 ) by the one-step method in ambient air. The target PSCs exhibit a PCE of 23.71%, which is higher than that (22.22%) of the control PSCs (Supplementary Fig.  30 , Supplementary Note  8
and Supplementary Table  8 ). In detail, the
J SC
of the target PSCs is 24.83 mA cm − 2 , which shows a small variation with the integrated
J SC
of the corresponding EQE measurement. To investigate the effect of incorporated GBA on PSCs’ intrinsic stability, the PCE evolution of unencapsulated PSCs under various conditions was monitored. We examined the long-term operational stability through MPP tracking of the unencapsulated PSCs under continuous AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm − 2 ) solar light in a N 2
atmosphere at 50 ± 5 °C (Fig.  4e ). The target PSCs could maintain 96% of their initial PCE after 500 hours. Conversely, the control PSCs dropped to <65% of the initial PCE in no more than 400 hours. GBA enhanced the operational stability of the PSCs due to the eliminated vacancy that was beneficial for ion migration, based on the reported degradation mechanism of PSCs during operation 46 . We further monitored the PCE evolution of unencapsulated PSCs stored in ambient air. The PCE of the target PSCs showed no evident decline after 2,000 hours of ageing, while the PCE of the control PSCs maintained only 68% of the initial value (Fig.  4f ). The enhanced air stability of the target PSCs could be ascribed to the decreased sensitivity of the perovskite film to moisture. The extrinsic stability of PSCs was also assessed following the International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability standardized stability testing procedure 49 . Initially, we performed MPP tracking of the encapsulated PSCs under continuous AM1.5 G (100 mW cm − 2 ) solar light in ambient air at 85% RH. As shown in Fig.  4g , the target PSCs maintained 85% of their initial PCE after 300 hours of operation at 85% RH. In contrast, the control PSCs dropped to <60% of the initial PCE in no more than 90 h. Then, we conducted stricter stability measurements on the encapsulated PSCs, as shown in Fig.  4h . The target PSCs exhibited T85 > 260 hours under the damp heat test (85 °C and 85% RH), while the control PSCs showed rapid decay. We also performed the accelerated degradation measurements of unencapsulated PSCs stored at 65% RH; the target PSCs show better moisture stability than control PSCs (Supplementary Fig.  31 ). On the basis of these results, GBA ensured the excellent stability of PSCs fabricated in ambient air, which enabled high-performance PSC fabrication that no longer required an inert atmosphere; this process could quickly lead towards the commercialization of these PSCs. Discussion In summary, high-efficiency PSCs were completely fabricated in ambient air by blocking hydration. On the basis of the critical role of the vacancy on perovskite hydration, perovskite crystallization was protected from moisture by eliminating the vacancy sites through the incorporation of GBA, ensuring the formation of high-quality perovskite films in ambient air. Due to the finely controlled perovskite crystallinity and decreased vacancy trap states, the PSCs fabricated in ambient air obtained a PCE of 25.32% (certified 25.08%); this is the highest value among the PSCs fabricated in the open environment up to date and rivals the state-of-the-art PSCs fabricated in a glovebox. In addition, unencapsulated PSCs exhibit excellent long-term stability, which can maintain 96% of their initial efficiency after 500 hours of operating at the maximum power point under simulated AM 1.5 G solar light. This work provides a feasible approach to enable high-performance PSC fabrication that no longer required an inert atmosphere and can quickly lead toward the commercialization of these efficient PSCs. Methods Materials The materials consisted of the following: FTO glass substrate (12–14 ohm); TiCl 4
(Aladdin, 99.9%); lead iodide (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%); guanabenz acetate salt (Aladdin); DMF (Sigma-Aldrich); DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich); isopropanol (Acros, 99.8%); chlorobenzene (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5%); acetonitrile (Acros, 99.9%); FAI, MAI, MACl, o-F-PEAI, Spiro-OMeTAD, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonimide) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp). Device fabrication in ambient air Preparation of the FTO glass substrate: the FTO glass substrate was ultrasonically cleaned with deionized water, ethanol and deionized water for 15 min each. After drying the substrate with a high-purity N 2
stream, the substrate was treated with ultraviolet ozone for 15 min to obtain the hydrophilic surface. Preparation of the compact TiO 2
electron transport layer: to prepare the TiO 2
electron transport layers, TiCl 4
(3 ml) and deionized water (200 ml) were mixed and stirred to obtain a TiO 2
precursor. Then the FTO substrate was immersed into the precursor and stored in a water bath at 70 °C for 40 min to obtain the compact TiO 2
layer. Before spin coating the perovskite precursor, the FTO/TiO 2
substrate was treated with UV-ozone for 15 min to improve infiltration and passivate oxygen vacancy defect 50 . Preparation of perovskite via the two-step method with different humidities: a 1.5 M PbI 2
(DMF: DMSO, 9:1 volume/volume) precursor with different ratios of guanabenz acetate (GBA, the molar ratio of GBA/PbI 2
was 1%, 3%, 5%) was spin coated on the FTO/TiO 2
substrate at 1,500 r.p.m. for 30 s and then annealed at 70 °C for 60 s. After the PbI 2
film cooled to room temperature, ammonium salt (90 mg FAI, 9 mg MACl, 6.39 mg MAI in 1 ml IPA) was spin coated on the PbI 2
film at 2,000 r.p.m. for 30 s and then annealed at 150 °C for 15 min. The addition of MACl can inhibit the transformation from black ɑ-phase perovskite to yellow δ-phase non-perovskite, increasing the stability of the perovskite 51 . The characterization in the full text, and the champion PSCs, were fabricated via the two-step method. Preparation of perovskite by the one-step method: the 1.86 M FA 0.25 MA 0.75 PbI 3
(DMF: DMSO, 13:2 volume/volume) precursor with 3% GBA was spin coated on the FTO/TiO 2
substrate at 4,000 r.p.m. for 18 s, and 200 μl diethyl ether as an antisolvent was dripped on the centre of the film 12 s before the end of spin coating. Then the film was annealed at 110 °C for 10 min. The PSCs fabricated by the one-step method appear only in Supplementary Fig.  30 . Preparation of the o-F-PEAI layer: 10 mM o-F-PEAI dissolved in IPA was spin coated on the FTO/TiO 2 /perovskite surface at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s without further annealing. Preparation of the Spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer: the Spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by mixing 72.3 mg Spiro-OMeTAD in 1 ml chlorobenzene with 26.6 μl 4-tert-butylpyridine and 18 μl lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonimide) (520 mg ml −1
in acetonitrile); this was spin coated at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. Preparation of the Au electrode: Au electrode (60 nm) was deposited by thermal evaporation. SEM, XRD and GIXRD measurements: surface morphology was characterized by cold field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800). The crystallinity of perovskite films was measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker-D8-Discover) and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD, Micromax-007HF). The XRD using Cu Kα (λ = 0.15406 nm) radiation (40 kV, 40 mA), the scan step was 0.01 s and the speed was 2° min −1 . The GIXRD pattern was collected using Mo Kα (λ = 0.709 Å) with a sample-detector distance of 217 nm, and the grazing angle of incidence is 0.5°. The morphology evolution of the perovskite film under continuous water spray was observed under an optical microscope (OLYMPUS, DSX500). UV–vis measurement: the absorption intensity of perovskite films was measured by UV–vis spectrophotometer (UV-2600). FTIR and XPS measurements: the chemical interaction of GBA with perovskite was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Bruker) in the region of 400–4,000 cm −1 . The surface chemical environment of the perovskite film was investigated with an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi). DLTS measurement: deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS, FT230) was used to characterize a wide variety of traps in the perovskite film. The sample structure is FTO/Perovskite/MoO x /Au. The temperature range is from 180 to 340 K. The bias voltage, pulse voltage and pulse width are −0.2 V, −0.01 V and 100 ms, respectively. Atomic force microscopy and KPFM measurements: atomic force microscopy (FMNanoview 1000) and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) were performed to characterize the surface morphology and surface potential of the control and target films. PL, PLQE, and TRPL measurements: steady-state photoluminescence (PL, FLS98003040404), photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) were used to characterize the carrier behaviour in the perovskite film. The excitation wavelength is 470 nm. PL mapping was carried out with laser confocal fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (Nikon-ARsiMP-LSM-Kit-Legend Elite-USX) at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm. The signal collection area is 55 × 55 μm. TRPL spectra can be fitted according to the following biexponential equation
I ( t ): $$I(t)={A}_{1}\exp \left(\frac{-t}{{\tau }_{1}}\right)+{A}_{2}\,\exp \left(\frac{-t}{{\tau }_{2}}\right)$$ where parameters
A 1
and
A 2
are the amplitude fraction for each decay component,
τ 1
denotes the fast decay time constants corresponding to radiative recombination processes and
τ 2
denotes the slow decay time constants corresponding to non-radiative recombination processes. Density functional theory simulations All spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package 52 , 53 , with the generalized gradient approximation method for electronic exchange-correlation. Electron correlations were considered by the generalized gradient approximation method with the functional developed by Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof 52 , 54 . Core electrons were considered by the projector-augmented wave method 55 , 56 . The cut-off was set to 500 eV and the van der Waals interactions were taken into consideration. The geometries of the models were considered fully relaxed when all the forces became lower than 0.05 eV Å −1 . We constructed the 2 × 2 × 2 α-FAPbI 3
supercell from optimized M. T. Weller et. al. 57
primitive cells for expansion. Therefore, the k-point mesh sampling of 3 × 3 × 3 is used for structural optimization. The α-FAPbI 3
structure parameters were listed in Supplementary Table  10 . The binding energies ( E b ) are calculated with:
E b  =  E AB  −  E A  −  E B , where
E A ,
E B , is the energy of the free A and B and
E AB
is the total energy of the adsorption system. To study the effect of defects, the vacancy was created by randomly removing the species from the α-FAPbI 3
supercell to calculate the defect formation energies of charged neutral defects 58 . Device performance measurement The device efficiency was characterized by a Keithley 2400 source meter with a scan rate of 13 mV s −1
under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm −2 ) using a 150 W Class AAA solar simulator (XES-40S1, SAN-EI); the light intensity was calibrated by the National Institute of Metrology certified silicon solar cell. The external quantum efficiency and integrating current of perovskite solar cells were measured by QE-R systems (Enli Tech). Device stability measurement The devices used to test intrinsic stability were without encapsulation. For the long-term operational stability test, the devices were tracked at the maximum power point under light-emitting diode (LED) illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm − 2 ) at 50 ± 5 °C in a N 2
glovebox. The LED light intensity was calibrated by the National Institute of Metrology certified silicon solar cell. For long-term ageing stability, the devices were stored in ambient air at room temperature (25 ± 5 °C, 20% RH) and measured every two days. The devices used to test extrinsic stability were encapsulated in the air using a glass cover and a UV-curable glue for edge sealing. For long-term operational stability, the devices were tracked at the MPP under LED illumination (AM1.5 G, 100 mW cm − 2 ) at 85% RH in the environmental test box. The damp heat test was conducted by keeping the devices at 85 °C, 85% RH in the climate test chamber. The accelerated degradation measurements of unencapsulated PSCs were conducted by keeping the devices at 25 ± 5 °C, 65% RH in the climate test chamber.

Abstract Inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) promise enhanced operating stability compared to their normal-structure counterparts 1 , 2 , 3 . To improve efficiency further, it is crucial to combine effective light management with low interfacial losses 4 , 5 . Here we develop a conformal self-assembled monolayer (SAM) as the hole-selective contact on light-managing textured substrates. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that cluster formation during phosphonic acid adsorption leads to incomplete SAM coverage. We devise a co-adsorbent strategy that disassembles high-order clusters, thus homogenizing the distribution of phosphonic acid molecules, and thereby minimizing interfacial recombination and improving electronic structures. We report a laboratory-measured power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.3% and a certified quasi-steady-state PCE of 24.8% for inverted PSCs, with a photocurrent approaching 95% of the Shockley–Queisser maximum. An encapsulated device having a PCE of 24.6% at room temperature retains 95% of its peak performance when stressed at 65 °C and 50% relative humidity following more than 1,000 h of maximum power point tracking under 1 sun illumination. This represents one of the most stable PSCs subjected to accelerated ageing: achieved with a PCE surpassing 24%. The engineering of phosphonic acid adsorption on textured substrates offers a promising avenue for efficient and stable PSCs. It is also anticipated to benefit other optoelectronic devices that require light management.

Surface reaction for efficient and stable inverted perovskite solar cells

Main Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently attained a certified efficiency of 26.1% (ref.
6 ); however, the very highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) devices have yet to meet operating stability under accelerated ageing tests 5 . The limited device stability is attributed to the presence of mobile and hygroscopic p-type dopants in hole-transporting layers, which undermine moisture and thermal stability 7 . Inverted PSCs present a solution by utilizing undoped hole-selective contacts 8 . Recent studies have shown PCEs surpassing 25% for inverted PSCs 2 . However, when adhering to the stringent quasi-steady-state (QSS) protocol, their certified efficiency (approximately 24%) requires further improvement 3 , 9 . Efforts to improve inverted PSC efficiency have focused on interface passivation 2 , 9 , 10 . This approach suppresses non-radiative recombination and thus improves fill factors and photovoltages 11 . Nevertheless, higher photocurrents are needed for efficiency gains. In normal-structure PSCs, this has been realized using textured fluorine-doped tin oxides (FTO) as the transparent conductive oxides (TCO) 4 , 5 . The pyramidal grains on FTO minimize reflection losses and extend the length of the average optical path 4 . By contrast, inverted PSCs, often built on smooth indium tin oxides (ITOs) 9 , 10 , face substantial optical losses due to the lack of light management. The discrepancy is ascribed to differences in transporting materials and deposition techniques. In normal-structure PSCs, inorganic hole-blocking layers are conformally deposited on textured substrates using spray pyrolysis and chemical bath deposition 4 , 5 . However, inverted PSCs typically use ultrathin (less than 5 nm) organic hole-selective contacts on substrates 2 , 3 , which can be challenging to deposit uniformly using solution processing 12 . Inhomogeneity leads to energy losses and insufficient carrier extraction 13 . Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), particularly those composed of phosphonic acid molecules with hole-selective tail groups, have shown promise in addressing this issue 14 . Phosphonic acids establish coordinative/covalent bonds with TCOs, enabling sufficient SAM coverage on rough surfaces 15 . This could provide a low-loss interface, uniting light management with interface passivation. Indeed, photocurrent improvements have been observed when replacing SAM-modified ITO with FTO substrates in inverted PSCs 16 . Despite their promise, achieving a high-density, closely packed SAM remains challenging, which leads to erratic interfacial properties 17 . For example, Liu and co-workers revealed that phosphonic acids failed to fully cover textured wafers, which affected the performance of tandem solar cells 18 . Even on flat substrates, the formation of SAMs tends to be non-uniform, a problem usually attributed to the limited solubility of phosphonic acids 19
and their insufficient chemical bond formation with metal oxides 20 . Several strategies have been proposed to ensure conformal SAM coverage, such as utilizing more reactive oxide surfaces (for example, nickel oxides) to promote hetero condensation 18 , using thermal evaporation for SAM deposition 21
and designing highly soluble phosphonic acid molecules 19 . However, these methods can be laborious, requiring time-intensive molecule design, synthesis and vacuum-based layer deposition. Additionally, the use of highly reactive oxides could compromise device stability owing to redox reactions with ammonium halides 22 . Molecular dynamics simulations We sought to deepen understanding of how phosphonic acids interact with textured TCOs. We began by looking at the case of 2-(9 H -carbazol-9-yl)ethyl)phosphonic acid (2PACz), an organic molecule (Fig.
1a ) capable of forming SAMs on TCOs 14 , and investigated its interactions with FTO. 2PACz has found extensive applications as a hole-selective contact in PSCs in view of its excellent defect passivation and deep highest occupied molecular orbital level 21 . The surface properties of FTO were approximated using tin oxides (SnO 2 ), since commercial FTO has a fluorine-doping level under 0.5% (atomic percentage) 23 . Flat versus corrugated SnO 2
was analysed to understand the effects of surface morphology (Supplementary Fig.
1 ). Fig. 1: Molecular dynamics simulations of phosphonic acid adsorption with and without molecular additives. a , Chemical structures of the phosphonic acid 2PACz and the bifunctional compound 3-MPA.
b , Total number of 2PACz clusters formed over a set period, in the absence (without, control) and presence (with, mixed) of 3-MPA.

f , Successive steps along an AIMD trajectory showcasing the role of 3-MPA as a co-adsorbent. Large, encircled areas are magnifications of small ones. Full size image Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that 2PACz molecules can agglomerate, forming dimers, trimers and tetramers (Fig.
1b
and Supplementary Fig.
2 ). Within the initial 1 nanosecond of simulations, 90% of the final number of clusters has been reached (Fig.
1b ), and dimers were the most prevalent among those clusters (Fig.
1c ). Compared to flat surfaces, textured surfaces led to more clusters (for example, 7 versus 0 for 20 2PACz molecules on 6 nm wide SnO 2 ) (Supplementary Note  1
and Supplementary Figs.
3
and
4 ). The cluster formation is closely linked to the inhomogeneity of SAMs on FTO. For instance, when 162 2PACz molecules are positioned on top of textured SnO 2
surfaces, despite their initial random distribution (Supplementary Video  1 ), the final equilibrated structures exhibit clear phase segregation (Fig.
1d ), in which almost 85% of the SnO 2
surface remains uncovered by any 2PACz molecules (Supplementary Fig.
5 ). These observations were also verified in a larger system (22 nm width; 1,134 2PACz molecules) (Supplementary Fig.
6 ). Reasoning that a thiol group (–SH) could interact with phosphonic acids and a carboxyl group (–COOH) attached to FTO, we introduced 3-mercaptopropionic acid (3-MPA) (Fig.
1a ) in simulations to break apart 2PACz clusters, particularly on textured substrates. The approach is akin to the co-adsorbent strategy used in dye-sensitized solar cells to reduce dye aggregation on titanium oxides 24 . Similar strategies have been used to improve the quality of hole-selective SAMs 25 , 26 . With 3-MPA at a molar ratio of 1:9 with 2PACz, we saw a relative 15% decrease in the number of clusters on textured surfaces (Fig.
1b ), and a slower formation rate (20 ns −1
versus 28 ns −1 ) (Supplementary Fig.
7 ). In particular, the higher order clusters (trimers and tetramers) decreased by 53% (Fig.
1c ). As a result, the mixed system shows less phase segregation (Fig.
1e
and Supplementary Video  2 ), leading to extended surface coverage (67% versus 15%) by 2PACz molecules (Supplementary Fig.
5 ). Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations (Supplementary Note  2
and Supplementary Fig.
8 ) indicate that the presence of 3-MPA hinders the free movement of individual 2PACz molecules by forming a supramolecular structure (Fig.
1f ). This reduces agglomeration with already formed dimers, suppressing the formation of higher-order clusters (Supplementary Video  3 ). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed surface binding energies of −3.2 eV and −2.6 eV for 2PACz and 3-MPA, respectively, which are much stronger than the interaction energies of 2PACz clusters (−0.3 to −0.1 eV per molecule). This indicates robust anchoring of 2PACz and 3-MPA molecules on contact with substrate surfaces. Characterization of organic contacts We deposited both 2PACz and a mixture of 2PACz:3-MPA on FTO substrates using solution processing, followed by annealing the film at 100 °C and solvent washing ( Methods ). Micelles were detected in the processing solutions through dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Supplementary Fig.
9 ). However, owing to their limited proportion in the volume distribution compared to 2PACz monomers, film formation primarily resulted from molecular diffusion rather than direct micellar adsorption 27 . The film composition and its interaction with FTO substrates were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), respectively. For the film consisting solely of 2PACz molecules (the control), the presence of 2PACz was evidenced by the appearance of the phosphine (P) doublet peak (Fig.
2a ) and the characteristic C–N peak and C–C/C–H peak (Supplementary Fig.
10 ) in the XPS spectra 21 . In the case of mixed film, 3-MPA was indicated by the sulfur (S) 2 p
doublet peak at around 163.8 eV (that is, the thiol group) (Fig.
2a ) 28 . From ATR-FTIR, bidentate or tridentate binding was identified as the mode of 2PACz–FTO interactions, given the appearance of the symmetric PO 3 2−
stretching (at 996 cm −1
for the control sample) 29 , 30
and the disappearance of P–OH vibrations 14 . These also indicated that solvent washing removed unbound molecules 14 . With 3-MPA addition, a redshift of approximately 5 cm −1
was observed for the PO 3 2−
vibrational mode, indicating the enhanced surface binding of 2PACz—as confirmed by AIMD simulations (Supplementary Note  3
and Supplementary Figs.
11
and
12 ). ATR-FTIR of the FTO/3-MPA sample (Fig.
2b ) further showed carboxylate-related peaks and a reduction in the intensity of the C=O peak, which correspond to the bidentate chelation of 3-MPA with FTO surfaces 31 . Combining the results from XPS and ATR-FTIR, we reasoned that 3-MPA functioned as a co-adsorbent, modulating the interaction of 2PACz with FTO substrates.

Topography images revealed that, despite varying SAM modifications, the surface morphology of FTO substrates was retained owing to the ultrathin nature of SAMs (Supplementary Fig.
13 ). From the respective contact potential difference (CPD) maps (Fig.
2c ), we recorded surface potential variations on 2PACz-modified surfaces within a range of 120 mV. A Gaussian fit of the single peak in the CPD distribution yielded the full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of 37 mV (Supplementary Fig.
14 ). Introducing 3-MPA enhanced the homogeneity of electronic properties on SAM-modified surfaces, as reflected by a narrower CPD distribution with the FWHM of 22 mV. To directly visualize the distribution of SAMs on FTO substrates, we performed high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements. Figure
2d
shows cross-sectional HAADF-STEM images of both control and mixed samples. Because of the contrast in the atomic number 2 , SAM was discernible as a dark layer sandwiched between the brighter FTO and protective molybdenum oxide (MoO x ) layers. For the control SAM, we observed thickness variations across the same FTO facet, with certain regions showing thicknesses less than 1 nm. This suggests a low-density coverage and inhomogeneous distribution of 2PACz molecules 32 . The mixed sample exhibited significant improvements in terms of SAM uniformity and coverage; a consistent thickness was recorded for the mixed SAM on the same facet, albeit with variations between 1 and 2 nm across different facets. Correspondingly, mixed SAM-modified FTO substrates exhibited higher hydrophobicity than control SAM-modified counterparts (Supplementary Fig.
15 ). Cyclic voltammetry measurements further determined the areal density of 2PACz in the mixed SAM to be 3.9 × 10 13
molecules per cm 2 , a 70% increase from the 2.3 × 10 13
molecules per cm 2
in the control SAM (Supplementary Fig.
16 ) 16 , 27 . Characterization of perovskite films To investigate the impact of SAMs on the structural and optoelectronic properties of perovskites, we fabricated triple-cation Cs 0.05 MA 0.10 FA 0.85 PbI 3
perovskite thin films on different FTO/SAM substrates. From scanning electron microscopy (SEM), we observed no notable change in the perovskite surface morphology when 3-MPA was incorporated into the SAM (Fig.
3a,b ). Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements showed nearly identical crystal structures for perovskites deposited on both the control and mixed SAMs (Fig.
3c ). Here, the main constituent was photoactive α-phase perovskites, with traces of the 4H hexagonal phase detected at
q  = 0.82 Å −1
and 0.92 Å −1
as well as PbI 2
at
q  = 0.90 Å −1 , respectively (Supplementary Fig.
14 ) 33 . Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) further confirmed that both 3-MPA and 2PACz molecules, owing to their chemisorption on FTO surfaces, remained localized at the perovskite–FTO interfaces (Fig.
3d,e ). These findings suggest that 3-MPA is not likely to change the perovskite formation process or contribute to the grain boundary or top surface passivation.

IE, ionization energy; HTL, hole-transport layer; PVSK, perovskite. Full size image We conducted photoluminescence characterization by exciting perovskite thin films at a 1 sun equivalent photon flux. We saw an average photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 0.13% ± 0.02% for perovskites directly deposited onto FTO substrates, corresponding to a quasi-Fermi level splitting of 1.105 eV (Supplementary Table
1 ) 34 . 2PACz can passivate defects on metal oxide surfaces and effectively block electron injection 35 , resulting in an approximately 50-fold increase in the photoluminescence intensity (Fig.
3f ). We noted an average PLQY of 7% ± 2% for the perovskite/2PACz/FTO stacks (Fig.
3g ), corresponding to a quasi-Fermi level splitting of 1.207 eV. The incorporation of 3-MPA further improved the average PLQY to 10% ± 1%. This we ascribed to better SAM coverage rather than 3-MPA passivation, as the thiol group of 3-MPA was embedded within the SAM (Fig.
1f ). We used ultraviolet and inverse photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS and IPES) to determine the work function and transport energy levels of perovskites and SAMs. The secondary electron cutoff in the UPS spectra indicated an increase in the work function from 4.56 to 4.93 eV on depositing the control SAM on the FTO substrate (Supplementary Fig.
18 ). 3-MPA led to an additional work function shift of +100 meV. The ionization energy was 5.51 and 5.64 eV for the control and mixed SAMs, respectively. By contrast, perovskites exhibited similar conduction band minima and valance band maxima on different substrates (Fig.
3h ). The resultant energy-level diagrams of perovskites and SAMs are depicted in Fig.
3i,j . A vacuum level shift of 0.17 eV was recorded between the perovskite and the 2PACz bilayer, which further increased to 0.32 eV for the perovskite/mixed SAM bilayer 36 . A higher vacuum level shift indicates an enlarged built-in field 37 , which in PSCs can lead to enhanced carrier extraction 38 . Meanwhile, the ionization energy offset between the bilayer remained consistent for the control and mixed SAMs (referenced to the Fermi level ( E F )). Solar cell efficiency and stability We fabricated PSCs with the following inverted structure: FTO/SAM/perovskites/3,4,5-trifluoroanilinium (345FAn)/fullerene (C 60 )/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag (Fig.
4a
and Supplementary Fig.
19 ). 345FAn was selected for interface engineering because of its thermal stability 1 . 2PACz (control) and 2PACz:3-MPA (mixed) were used as the SAMs for hole-selective contact. The corresponding solar cell parameters are summarized in Fig.
4b . We found that compared to control devices, the mixed SAM led to improved performance (average PCE 25.0% compared with 24.1%). This came from improved open-circuit voltage ( V oc , from 1.141 V to 1.159 V) and fill factor (from 82.3% to 84.1%) (Supplementary Note  4 ). We noted that device reproducibility was comparable for both control and mixed SAMs, probably owing to SAM inhomogeneity occurring at the nanoscale 18 , 27 . The champion device with the mixed SAM exhibited a PCE of 25.3% from the reverse
J – V
scan, which agrees with the PCE obtained from the steady-state power output (Supplementary Fig.
20 ). The integrated short-circuit current density ( J sc ) of 25.8 mA cm −2
derived from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement matches well with that from the
J – V
sweep (Fig.
4c ). Fig. 4: Photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells. a , Schematic illustration of the device architecture with textured FTO substrate.

The device configuration is FTO/SAM/perovskite/345FAn/C 60 /ALD-SnO 2 /Ag, with a PCE of 24.6% at room temperature. ALD, atomic-layer deposition; FF, fill factor. Full size image One mixed SAM-based FTO device was characterized at Newport; and produced a QSS-certified PCE of 24.8%, with a
V oc
of 1.150 V, a
J sc
of 25.5 mA cm −2
and a fill factor of 84.5% (Fig.
4d
and Supplementary Fig.
21 ). Although there have been reports of inverted PSCs with efficiencies surpassing 25% (refs.
2 , 3 ), the certified PCEs measured under stabilized conditions (including maximum power point (MPP) and QSS tracking) have yet to reach the same level (Supplementary Table
2 ). The QSS efficiency reported herein represents a new record for inverted PSCs, improving on the previous record QSS efficiency of 24.09% in the literature (Fig.
4e ). For comparison, inverted PSCs were fabricated on smooth ITO substrates. We obtained an average PCE of 23.4% for control ITO devices, which was lower than that of control FTO devices, despite their higher average
V oc
and fill factor (Supplementary Fig.
22 ). This emphasizes the need to augment
J sc
for inverted PSCs. The limited
J sc
is ascribed to the smoothness of ITO substrates (Supplementary Fig.
23 ), leading to reduced light scattering and thus insufficient light absorption in the full device (Supplementary Fig.
24 ). Interestingly, the performance of mixed SAM-based ITO devices was only slightly improved, possibly owing to the weak interactions of 3-MPA with ITO surfaces (Supplementary Note  5
and Supplementary Fig.
25 ). We evaluated the operating stability of PSCs using International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS)-L-3 protocols, in which the encapsulated device was subjected to continuous 1 sun equivalent, white light-emitting diode illumination (Supplementary Fig.
26 ) at 50% relative humidity and heat sink temperature of 65 °C. To impede ion and moisture diffusion, we replaced BCP with atomic layer-deposited SnO 2
as a buffer layer 9 . The resultant device delivered a PCE of 24.6% at room temperature (Supplementary Fig.
27 ). During the ISOS-L-3 testing, the device initially demonstrated a PCE of 22.6%, which increased to 23.1% after 1.6 h of MPP tracking (Fig.
4f ). The lower PCE at 65 °C compared to room temperature is ascribed to the negative temperature coefficient of PSCs (–0.15% per °C) 39 . The PCE stabilized at 21.9% (95% of the peak PCE) until the end of the test (1,075 h), with the main degradation in the photocurrent (Supplementary Fig.
28 ). The initial performance and operating stability reported herein are compared with other PSCs subjected to ISOS-L-3 tests (Supplementary Table
3 ). Methods Molecular dynamics simulations Static DFT calculation and AIMD were performed with the CP2K 40
package utilizing a mixed Gaussian/plane wave (GPW) basis. The PBE exchange-correlation functional 41 , DFT-D3 dispersion corrections 42
and dipole corrections 43
necessary for periodic boundary conditions along the perpendicular direction to the surface were included. Valence electron wave functions were expanded in a double- ζ
Gaussian basis set with polarization functions (DZVP) 44 . The energy cutoff for the electron density expansion in the GPW method was 400 Ry. Born–Oppenheimer AIMD simulations were run with an integration time step of 0.5 fs and the system was kept at 300 K using the thermostat of Bussi et al. 45
in a canonical isothermal–isochoric (NVT) ensemble, in which the total number of atoms
N , the volume
V
and the temperature
T
of the system were held constant. All AIMD simulations were performed at Γ point. Being the most stable surface, the SnO 2 (110) was chosen as the substrate surface. The systems were equilibrated over 5 ps in the NVT ensemble and the remaining 40 ps were used for the production run. To investigate the interactions between the 2PACz and 3-MPA molecules, as well as molecules and the SnO 2
substrate, five scenarios were simulated: (1) a single molecule (2PCAz or 3-MPA) on SnO 2 (110); (2) one 2PACz and one 3-MPA concurrently on SnO 2 (110); (3) two 2PACz and one 3-MPA on SnO 2 (110); (4) four 2PACz and one 3-MPA on SnO 2 (110); and (5) six 2PACz and one 3-MPA on SnO 2 (110). In all the scenarios, an in-plane SnO 2 (110) simulation cell of 22.690 Å × 27.756 Å with 45 Å of vacuum between the slab repetitions was used. AIMD was also used to estimate the interaction energy of 2PACz and 3-MPA with the SnO 2 (110) surface. The final AIMD configurations were relaxed with DFT to extract the interaction energies of the molecules. Binding energies were calculated as Δ E b  =  E tot  −  E S  −  E mol , where
E tot
is the energy of the final relaxed configuration (molecule on SnO 2 (110));
E S
is the energy of the final configuration of the slab; and
E mol
is the energy of the final configuration of the isolated molecule. The interaction energies of 2PACz clusters were computed after DFT relaxations of isolated clusters. Dimers, trimers and tetramers were considered. Interaction energies per molecule were calculated as Δ E i  = ( E tot  −  nE mol )/ n , where
E tot
is the energy of the final relaxed cluster;
n
is the number of molecules forming the cluster; and
E mol
is the energy of a single relaxed molecule assumed isolated. Vibrational power spectra were computed as the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function of the atomic velocities. Classical molecular dynamics simulations with full atomic resolution were realized with the help of the LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulator 46 . The equations of motion were integrated using the velocity Verlet method 47 , with a 1 fs time step, in which bond stretching was not constrained for any bonds. To maintain isothermal conditions, the deterministic Nosé–Hoover thermostat 48 , 49 , with a time constant equal to 0.1 ps, was used. This ensured that thermostating was applied to both translational and rotational degrees of freedom, crucial for the asymmetric 2PACz and 3-MPA molecules. All classical molecular dynamics simulations were realized in the canonical NVT ensemble at
T  = 300 K comprising a V-shaped SnO 2 (110) model system with dimensions 60 Å × 105 Å × 40 Å. Periodic boundary conditions were used in
x
and
y
directions, whereas reflective boundary conditions were used in the
z
direction. The two considered systems, control and mixed, consisted of a total of 18,498 and 18,714 atoms, respectively, whereas the experimental molar ratio (2PACz:3-MPA = 9:1) was retained in the simulated mixed system. The systems were equilibrated for 1 ns followed by a 10 ns production simulation, during which sampling took place every 500 fs for the calculation of ensemble averages. A snapshot of the system was taken every 1,000 fs for visualization purposes. The calculation of the number distributions of formed 2PACz clusters was performed through an in-house code using a threshold distance of 8 Å among the centre of masses of adjacent 2PACz molecules, in accordance with the nearest neighbour shell of the corresponding radial distribution function as clustering criterion. To accurately capture the interactions of SnO 2 , the thoroughly validated classical force field developed by Bandura et al. 50
was used. The all-atom OPLS force field was utilized for 3-MPA, wherein the corresponding interaction parameters were obtained with the help of the LigParGen server 51 . For 2PACz, containing the phosphonic functional group, the specially designed force field developed by Meltzer et al. 52
based on the generalized Amber force field 53
was used. The van der Waals and electrostatic non-bonded interactions were calculated using a real-space cutoff radius of 10 Å and 8 Å, respectively, whereas the particle–particle–particle–mesh scheme 54
with an accuracy of 0.0001 (kcal mol −1 ) Å −1
was used for the consideration of long-range electrostatic interactions. Because the SnO 2
force field uses a Buckingham potential for the van der Waals interactions, its combination with the Lennard-Jones potential used for the compounds was realized by fitting the Buckingham parameters of SnO 2
to a suitable set of Lennard-Jones parameters 55
and geometric mixing rules were applied for all dissimilar non-bonded interactions. Materials All materials were used as received without further purification. Organic halide salts, including methylammonium iodide (MAI), formamidinium iodide (FAI) and methylammonium chloride (MACl), were purchased from Great Cell Solar. Caesium iodide (CsI), 3-mercaptopropionic acid (3-MPA), 3,4,5-trifluoroaniline (98%) and guanidinium thiocyanate (GuaSCN) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 3,4,5-Trifluoroaniline was converted to its ammonium form following the published procedure. 2PACz, lead iodide (PbI 2 , 99.99%) and BCP were purchased from TCI. Anhydrous solvents, including
N , N -dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%), 2-propanol (IPA, 99.5%), chloroform (CF, 99.8%) and anisole (99.7%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The C 60
was purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology. ITO and FTO (TEC 10) substrates were purchased from Thin Film Devices and Ossila, respectively. Perovskite film fabrication First, 1.5 M Cs 0.05 MA 0.1 FA 0.85 PbI 3
perovskite precursor was fully dissolved in mixed solvents of DMF and DMSO (4:1, v/v) with the molar ratio for FAI/MAI/CsI of 0.85:0.1:0.05. Then, 10 mg ml −1
MACl and 8 mg ml −1
GuaSCN were added to the solution to improve the film morphology. The precursor solution was filtered through a 0.22 μm polytetrafluoroethylene membrane before use. A portion of 60 μl of perovskite solution was deposited on the substrate and spun cast at 1,000 rpm for 10 s, followed by 6,000 rpm for 30 s. A 150 μl portion of anisole was dropped onto the substrate during the last 5 s of spinning, resulting in the formation of dark brown films that were then annealed on a hot plate at 100 °C for ITO and 120 °C for FTO, for 20 min. Device fabrication FTO glasses were sequentially sonicated in aqueous detergent, deionized water, acetone and IPA each for 10 min. After drying with nitrogen, the substrates were exposed to UV–ozone treatment for 15 min to remove organic contaminants and then transferred into a nitrogen-filled glovebox maintaining less than 0.1 ppm of O 2
and H 2 O. Then, 100 μl of 2PACz or a mixture of 2PACz:3-MPA (in a molar ratio of either 9:1 in characterization and device fabrication, or 8:2 in XPS measurements) in anhydrous ethanol (1 mM) solution was uniformly spread on the substrates and allowed to rest for 15 s, followed by spinning of the films at 3,000 rpm for 30 s. The films were then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min and washed by dropping 500 μl ethanol during the film spinning at 3,000 rpm. Perovskite solution was deposited on the SAM-modified substrate as detailed above. A 200 μl portion of 345FAn solution (1 mg ml −1 ) in CF with an additional 3% of IPA was then drop cast within 2–3 s on the perovskite film spinning at 4,000 rpm (that is, dynamic spinning) and annealed at 100 °C for 5 min. Both control and mixed SAM films were then transferred to the thermal evaporator (Angstrom Engineering). The C 60
(30 nm) and BCP (7 nm) were deposited sequentially with a rate of 0.3 Å s −1
and 0.5 Å s −1 , respectively, at a pressure of approximately 2 × 10 −6  mbar. Finally, Ag contact (140 nm) was deposited on top of BCP through a shadow mask with the desired aperture area. For the stability testing, ALD-SnO 2
was used as the barrier layer. The deposition of ALD-SnO 2
was carried out in the PICOSUN R-200 Advanced ALD system. H 2 O and TDMASn were used as oxygen and tin precursors. Precursor and substrate temperature were set to 75 °C and 85 °C, respectively. The carrier gas used was 90 sccm N 2 . Pulse and purge times for H 2 O were 1 s and 5 s, and 1.6 s and 5 s for TDMASn. The total deposition cycle was 120, corresponding to 20 nm of SnO 2 . Solar cell characterization The current–voltage ( I – V ) characteristics of solar cells were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under the illumination of a solar simulator (Newport, Class AAA) at a light intensity of 100 mW cm −2 , as checked using a calibrated reference solar cell (Newport). The stabilized PCE was measured by setting the bias voltage to the
V MPP
and then tracing the current density. The
V MPP
was determined from the reverse
I – V
curve. The active area was determined by the aperture shade mask (0.049 cm 2 ) placed in front of the solar cell to avoid overestimation of the photocurrent density. EQE spectra were recorded with a commercial system (Arkeo-Ariadne, Cicci Research) based on a 300 W xenon light source and a holographic grating monochromator (Cornerstone, Newport). Stability tests of solar cells Devices were placed in a homemade stability tracking station. The illumination source was a white-light LED with intensity calibrated to match the 1 sun condition. For the ISOS-L-3 ageing protocol (65 or 85 °C; 50% relative humidity; MPP) 56 , the device chamber was left open in a room with 50 ± 10% humidity and the solar cell was mounted on a metal plate kept at 65 °C by a heating element. A thermal couple attached to the metal plate was used to monitor and provide feedback control to the heating element to ensure temperature consistency. MPP was tracked using a home-built MATLAB-based MPP tracking system using a ‘perturb and observe’ method. The MPP was updated every 1,000 min. Encapsulation was done by capping the device with a glass slide, using UV adhesive (Lumtec LT-U001) as a sealant. XPS measurements XPS measurements were performed with a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha system with 180° double-focusing, hemispherical analyser. The system is equipped with a 128-channel detector and monochromatic small-spot XPS. An AlKα source (1,486.6 eV) was used for excitation and a pass energy of 50 eV was used for XPS acquisition. Samples were mounted on a metal specimen holder. All data were analysed with CasaXPS and Thermo Avantage software. KPFM measurements KPFM measurements were performed using an Asylum Research Cypher S atomic force microscope (Oxford Instruments) with an ASYELEC.01-R2 Ti-Ir coated cantilever (Asylum Research). Scans were performed over 2 µm at 512 pixels and 0.5 Hz using a two-pass method in which the first pass is a tapping mode topography scan and the second is in KPFM mode with a tip potential of 3 V and a surface clearance of 5 nm. Cantilever calibration was performed using the Thermal method from the Asylum Research GetReal database. HAADF-TEM measurements HAADF-TEM images were acquired at an aberration-corrected FEI Titan Cubed Themis G2 operated at 300 kV equipped with an XFEG gun and Bruker Super-X EDS detectors. The SAM samples had a structure of glass/FTO/SAM/MoO x
(50 nm), in which the MoO x
layer was deposited through thermal evaporation with a low rate of 0.1 Å s −1
at a pressure below 2 × 10 −4  Pa. The cross-sectional samples were prepared by using a focused ion-beam system (Helios G4 UX). Another protective layer of carbon was thermally evaporated before ion-beam cutting and etching. Cyclic voltammetry measurements Cyclic voltammetry measurements were conducted using a three-electrode configuration with a potentiostat (PGSTAT204, Autolab). The working electrodes were prepared using a spin-coating method on an FTO electrode. The exposed area of the working electrode to the electrolyte measured 8 mm × 21.4 mm. A platinum plate and an Ag/AgCl electrode (in a 3.0 M KCl solution) were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The measurements were performed in an Ar-saturated solution of 1,2-dichlorobenzene ( o -DCB) with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBA + PF 6 – ) serving as the supporting electrolyte. All potentials were referenced against the ferrocene redox couple, serving as an internal standard. The effective coverage of the self-assembled monolayers on the FTO surface was measured by the slope of a linear dependency of the oxidative peak intensity against the scan rate, as follows: $${i}_{{\rm{p,o}}}=\frac{{n}^{2}{F}^{2}}{{4RTN}_{{\rm{A}}}}{A\varGamma }^{* }v$$ where
i p,o
is the oxidative peak current,
v
is the voltage scan rate,
n
is the number of electrons transferred,
F
is the Faraday constant (96,485 C mol − 1 ),
R
is the universal gas constant (8.314 J K − 1  mol −1 ),
T
is the temperature,
N A
is the Avogadro constant,
A
is the electrode area and
Γ * is the areal density. UPS and IPES measurements UPS measurements were taken with an Excitech H Lyman-α photon source (10.2 eV) with a nitrogen-filled beam path coupled with a PHI 5600 UHV and analyser system. A sample bias of −5 V was applied and a pass energy of 5.85 eV was used for UPS acquisition. IPES measurements were performed in the Bremsstrahlung isochromatic mode with electron kinetic energies below 5 eV and an electron gun emission current of 2 μA was used to minimize sample damage. A Kimball Physics ELG-2 electron gun with a BaO cathode was used to generate the electron beam. Emitted photons were collected with a bandpass photon detector consisting of an optical bandpass filter (254 nm, Semrock) and a photomultiplier tube (R585, Hamamatsu Photonics). Samples were held at a −20 V bias during all IPES measurements and the UHV chamber was completely dark. Other characterizations Particle size distributions in solutions were determined by the DLS technique using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS. Contact angles were measured using VCA-Optima XE. The image was taken with a CCD camera within 1 s after water droplet. GIWAXS measurements were performed at the CMS beamline, NSLS II. The monochromatic X-ray with an energy of 13.5 keV was shone on the samples at different grazing incident angles of 1°, 0.5° and 0.08° with an exposure time of 10 s. A Pilatus 800K detector was placed 259 mm away from the sample to capture the two-dimensional diffraction pattern. Absolute intensity photoluminescence spectra were measured using an integrating sphere, and Andor Kymera 193i spectrograph, and a 660 nm continuous-wave laser set at 1 sun equivalent photon flux (1.1 µm beam FWHM, 632 µW); photoluminescence was collected at normal incidence using a 0.1 numerical aperture, 110-µm-diameter optical fibre. TOF-SIMS was conducted on the IONTOF M6 instrument with a Bi 3+
(30 keV) primary ion beam for analysis and a Cs cluster gun (2 keV) for sputtering. Data were acquired in positive mode with an analysis area of 49 × 49 μm 2
centred and a raster area of 200 × 200 μm 2 . IR spectra were obtained in the attenuated total reflectance mode using a Fourier-transform IR spectrometer (Thermo Scientific iS50). Samples were prepared on the FTO substrate and scanned in the spectral range of 4,000 to 550 cm –1
with a minimum number of 500 scans and a resolution of 4 cm − 1 . The triangular apodization function was used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. High-resolution SEM images were obtained using the Hitachi S5200 microscope with an accelerating voltage of 1.5 kV. A low accelerating voltage and a low beam current were deployed to reduce surface damage of perovskite films under electron beam bombardment. The diffuse and specular light reflected from the substrate surface was measured using a Cary 5000 UV-Vis-NIR double-beam spectrophotometer in diffuse reflectance mode. Pure BaSO 4
was used for the baseline collection. Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the  Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary

Abstract Perovskite solar cells with the formula FA 1− x Cs x PbI 3 , where FA is formamidinium, provide an attractive option for integrating high efficiency, durable stability and compatibility with scaled-up fabrication. Despite the incorporation of Cs cations, which could potentially enable a perfect perovskite lattice 1 , 2 , the compositional inhomogeneity caused by A-site cation segregation is likely to be detrimental to the photovoltaic performance of the solar cells 3 , 4 . Here we visualized the out-of-plane compositional inhomogeneity along the vertical direction across perovskite films and identified the underlying reasons for the inhomogeneity and its potential impact for devices. We devised a strategy using 1-(phenylsulfonyl)pyrrole to homogenize the distribution of cation composition in perovskite films. The resultant p–i–n devices yielded a certified steady-state photon-to-electron conversion efficiency of 25.2% and durable stability.

Main There have been significant improvements in the efficiency of lead-halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) 5 , largely due to the development of new passivation strategies 6 , 7
and the optimization of the perovskite composition 8 . Notably, the modulation of the A-site composition, specifically with FA-Cs alloyed perovskite, where FA is formamidinium, is emerging as a promising method for boosting efficiency 9 . However, there are growing concerns about the stability of Cs-containing perovskites due to the segregation of the cations, which could potentially accelerate the long-term degradation 3 , 4 , 10 , 11 . The distribution of these inhomogeneous phases within perovskites and their direct impact on efficiency are not yet fully understood. Herein, we visualize the spatially inhomogeneous phase distribution along the vertical direction across perovskite films and propose that device performance is limited by out-of-plane compositional inhomogeneity. Furthermore, we identified that unbalanced crystallization and phase transition between A-site components have a significant effect on the segregation of the FA and Cs phases. To address this issue, we devised a strategy using 1-(phenylsulfonyl)pyrrole (PSP) as an additive to retard the segregation of cations in FA-Cs perovskites. The PSP-treated devices have a p–i–n structure and yielded a champion photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.1% (certified reverse PCE of 25.8% and certified steady-state PCE of 25.2%). Out-of-plane cation inhomogeneity The distribution of A-site cations within perovskite films critically affects the performance of the device 12 . Although Cs has been widely used as a cation dopant in perovskite formulations, there are still concerns about the inhomogeneous distribution of cations. Figure
1a
is a schematic illustration of the out-of-plane cation inhomogeneity. It shows that Cs prefers to aggregate at the bottom of the perovskite film because crystallization has a significant impact on the compositional evolution within perovskite films. An organic molecule of PSP with a sulfone group 13 , 14
was designed as an additive to the precursor to address the cation inhomogeneity within perovskites, particularly for FA-Cs-containing perovskites (Fig.
1b , Supplementary Fig.
2

4 ). Figure
1c
illustrates that in the reference film, for the Cs there is an increasing intensity gradient from the perovskite surface towards the bottom. The FA cations have the opposite trend. This observation confirms the out-of-plane cation inhomogeneity within the perovskite film. Notably, the addition of PSP resulted in a homogeneous cation distribution. Furthermore, as inferred from the characteristic fraction of SO 2 − , PSP molecules accumulate at the bottom of the perovskite film. To further survey the elemental variation within the perovskite film, we conducted depth-dependent X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The extracted atomic percentage depth profiles have a similar out-of-plane compositional gradient (Fig.
1d ). The out-of-plane cation inhomogeneity could potentially influence the perovskite lattice, thereby altering the crystal structure. Hence, it is crucial to systematically investigate the structural variations induced by cation inhomogeneities. We visualized the out-of-plane A-site compositional inhomogeneity by studying the lattice heterogeneity of various perovskite phases. We collected cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. Three regions across the perovskite films (denoted as surface, bulk and bottom) were selected to survey the interplanar spacing of the lattice ( d ), which is a direct indication of phase heterogeneity. Vertical gradients for the cation distributions were directly observed by comparing the values of
d {200} . For the reference film, the three
d
values were measured to be
d surface  = 3.20 Å,
d bulk  = 3.15 Å and
d bottom  = 3.11 Å (Fig.
1e ). The decreasing trend of the
d
values correlates with the increasing internal lattice stress within the perovskite film. The decrease in
d bottom
suggests that there is a significant lattice mismatch at the bottom of the film 15 . This could be ascribed to the relatively smaller Cs atoms accumulating at the bottom, thereby generating a Cs-rich perovskite phase. Importantly, the detected lattice contraction implies that cation inhomogeneity is a contributory factor to the lattice strain 16 , 17 . In contrast, as shown in Fig.
1f , negligible variation of the
d
values was found in the PSP-treated film, which has
d surface  = 3.13 Å,
d bulk  = 3.13 Å and
d bottom  = 3.13 Å. This finding indicates that PSP treatment provides a better out-of-plane lattice alignment and releases the lattice stress by inhibiting phase segregation. We employed the grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) technique to detect the crystal structure from the exposed lower interface (Fig.
1g
and Extended Data Fig.
1 ). For the reference film, the peaks are at around 28.1°, which are indexed for the (200) plane of perovskite. The split is significantly wider. Shoulder peaks emerge at around 28.4° when the incident angle was lower than 2°. These emergent shoulder peaks gradually weaken with an increase of the incident angle and ultimately vanish. The spectrum changes to stronger integrated peaks when the incident angle is larger than 3°. In contrast, the shoulder peaks are negligible after introducing the PSP (Fig.
1h ). Moreover, a vertical misalignment of the peaks, which is an indication of the internal strain caused by lattice mismatch, is observed for the reference and PSP-1.2 films (Supplementary Figs.
5
and   6 ), which agrees well with the findings of the microscale TEM measurements. These results suggest that there is an out-of-plane inhomogeneous crystal structure within the reference perovskite film. The shoulder peaks may be associated with an undesired Cs-rich phase 2
in the buried region of the perovskite film. We presume, according to the coherence between 2 θ
and the lattice space, that the shoulder peaks can be attributed to a Cs-rich phase caused by Cs incorporation 15 , 18 , 19 . Considering the conventional X-ray diffraction (XRD) results (Supplementary Figs.
7
and   8 ), we may conclude that the spatially out-of-plane compositional inhomogeneity is generated by segregation of the FA and Cs phases in the perovskite films, even for Cs/(Cs + FA) ratios as low as 5%. The Cs-rich phase prefers to accumulate in the bottom region within perovskite films, thus leading to a gradient in the phase distribution from Cs-poor to Cs-rich from the surface to the bottom. Consequently, the results obtained allow us to conclude that in FA-Cs perovskite films, the different sizes of the cations of FA and Cs result in a spatially out-of-plane lattice mismatch. As shown in Fig.
1a , from top to bottom, there is a FA-rich phase, a phase in which the cations have nominal stoichiometry and a Cs-rich phase. Origin of the cation inhomogeneity We performed in situ synchrotron radiation grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) to investigate the two critical kinetics processes of crystallization and phase transition during perovskite formation. As demonstrated in Fig.
2a , signals for a
q
vector of around 0.8, 0.82 and 1.0 Å −1
can be assigned to the δ-phase perovskite of 2H (100), 6H (101), and α-phase perovskite, respectively 20 . We defined two periods when analysing the kinetic processes. Period I was from after chlorobenzene dripping until the emergence of α-phase perovskite. The duration of this period is indicative of the crystallization rate. Period II was the duration it took for the α phase to become stable, which reflects the δ- to α-phase transition rate. From the in situ GIWAXS results, we found that the introduction of PSP accelerates both the crystallization and phase transition. Combined with the results from ‘Out-of-plane cation inhomogeneity’, this shows that PSP has effectively inhibited the segregation of the FA and Cs phases. A possible kinetical culprit for the phase segregation is the slow speeds of crystallization and phase transition.

Full size image We further conducted density functional theory computations to thermodynamically investigate the barrier energy ( E B ) for perovskite crystallization and phase transition and subdivided the energy into the processes for the FA and Cs components. The difference between the barrier energies was defined as
\(\Delta {E}_{{\rm{B}}}={E}_{{\rm{B}}}^{{\rm{FA}}}-{E}_{{\rm{B}}}^{{\rm{Cs}}}\) . To evaluate more accurately the imbalance between the FA and Cs components, we calculated the mismatch factor
\(\mu =\frac{{E}_{{\rm{B}}}^{{\rm{FA}}}-{E}_{{\rm{B}}}^{{\rm{Cs}}}}{{E}_{{\rm{B}}}^{{\rm{FA}}}}\) . As shown in Fig.
2b,c , during period I, for the reference system, Δ E B,I ref  = 101.6 meV. After the PSP was introduced, Δ E B,I PSP  = 35.3 meV. The corresponding
μ
values were calculated to be
μ I,ref  = 20.48% and
μ I,PSP  = 5.34%. During period II, for the reference system, Δ E B,II ref  = 82 meV with
μ ref  = 12.49%, whereas Δ E B,II PSP  = −6 meV with
μ PSP  = −1.79% for the PSP system (Supplementary Table
2 ). The lower
μ I
and
μ II
for the PSP system indicate that the differences in the crystallization and phase transition rates of the FA and Cs components were reduced. Such differences in the rates for cations were probably responsible for the tardiness observed by in situ GIWAXS. A possible reason for the cation inhomogeneity could be the soft base property of the Cs cations compared to the FA cations, which may lead to a much more intensive interaction with PbI 3 − , leading to Cs preferentially aggregating at the bottom. Additionally, the difference in the solubilities of Cs and FA components might partially also contribute to the cation inhomogeneity 21 . We collected adsorption spectra of the Pb L III
edge using extended X-ray absorption fine spectroscopy (EXAFS) to evaluate the interactions between PSP and perovskite. We selected five grazing incident angles to capture information at various depths within the perovskite film (Supplementary Fig.
12 ). As shown in Fig.
2d,e , peaks at radial distances of approximately 2.2 and 2.9 Å can be attributed to Pb–O and Pb–I coordination, respectively 22 . In the reference film, we observed a gradual downwards shift of around 0.03 Å for the Pb–I coordination with an increase in detection depth (Fig.
2d ). This indicates that the lattice was compressed at the bottom of the perovskite 23 . In contrast, the peaks associated with Pb–I coordination remained relatively stable upon the incorporation of PSP, further reinforcing the existence of out-of-plane cation inhomogeneity. Notably, in the PSP film, peaks corresponding to Pb–O coordination migrated by a higher radial distance as the depth increased (Fig.
2e ). This suggests the creation of a longer Pb–O coordination at the bottom of the film. By calculating of the Pb–O coordination ratio as (Pb–O)/((Pb–O) + (Pb–I)) (Fig.
2f ), we concluded that Pb atoms at the bottom of the perovskite film tend to coordinate with additional oxygen atoms from PSP. Consequently, we hypothesize that PSP possibly interacts with the Pb atoms in perovskite through electrons donated by its two oxygen atoms. To precisely evaluate the interaction between PSP and PbI 2 , we synthesized (PbI 2 ) x (PSP) y
complex crystals (Extended Data Fig.
2
and Supplementary Fig.
13 ), and performed Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements. Peaks at around 1,328, 1,133 and 964 cm −1
correspond to asymmetric stretching vibration ( ν as ) and symmetric stretching vibration ( ν s ) of the sulfone (O=S=O) and vibration ( ν ) of the sulfoxide (S=O) group, respectively. Significant shifts in all three characteristic peaks indicate the coordination of PSP with PbI 2
through the sulfone (O=S=O) group (Fig.
2g ). The upward shifts of the
ν as
and
ν s
peaks imply that both oxygen atoms from PSP may serve as active sites. Additionally, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra corroborated the coordination of the O=S=O group with PbI 2 . This was discerned through shifts in the carbon atoms adjacent to the O=S=O group (nos. 1, 2, 6, 11 and 14) to a higher field (Extended Data Fig.
3 ). These findings align with the decreased PbI 2
signal observed by in situ GIWAXS tests and the peak shifts detected in XPS measurements (Supplementary Fig.
14 ). Optoelectronic properties Besides retarding the phase segregation, PSP has a practical passivation effect. The steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence were examined to optically evaluate changes in recombination caused by the out-of-plane lattice mismatch. In Fig.
3a , a significantly stronger photoluminescence peak was observed for the PSP film relative to that of the reference film. Moreover, the carrier lifetime of the PSP-treated film was extended to 1,876.6 ns compared with 491.7 ns for the reference (Fig.
3b
and Supplementary Table
3 ). We used thermal admittance spectroscopy to characterize the trap density of the perovskite films. Supplementary Fig.
17
depicts that the trap density of states decreased after PSP introduction at shallow and deep energetic levels. Shallow traps could be attributed to a homogeneous phase distribution, which may inhibit the formation of vacancies. Further, a released spatial lattice mismatch is beneficial for stabilizing octahedral frameworks, which in turn positively reduces the metal-related deep defects 24 , 25 . We further modelled the lattice and calculated the defect formation energy using FA 0.95 Cs 0.05 PbI 3
perovskite (Fig.
3c
and Supplementary Fig.
19 ). Figure
3d
shows that the defect formation energy of a series of defects was increased after PSP introduction, especially for the Pb and I vacancies, which should result in lower defect densities and longer carrier lifetimes in experiments.

e , f , Schematics for the band alignment within the reference perovskite film ( e ) and the PSP perovskite film ( f ). The values of the conduction-band minimum, valence-band maximum and Fermi level ( E F ) were extracted from the depth-profile ultraviolet-photoelectron spectrum. The schematics were finally obtained by combining data from three depth regions with a manually aligned
E F . HTL, hole-transport layer; ETL, electron-transport layer. Full size image Efficient carrier diffusion and extraction are affected by the vertical band alignment of different phases within a perovskite film, which correlates with the out-of-plane compositional inhomogeneity. Depth-profile ultraviolet-photoelectron spectroscopy was carried out to evaluate the internal band alignment (Extended Data Fig.
4 ). Figure
3e
shows that the out-of-plane compositional inhomogeneity may lead to quasi-type I band alignment at the contact region of the Cs-rich phase with a thickness of a few hundreds of nanometres. The conduction-band minimum and valence-band maximum are downwards and upwards twisted, respectively. This band alignment adversely affects carrier transport for solar cells through electrical doping 26
whether in a p–i–n or n–i–p configuration (Extended Data Fig.
5 ). In this case, the inherent disequilibrium of electron–hole extraction would be seriously aggravated 27 , 28 . Ultimately, it would worsen the device efficiency, especially the fill factor 29 , 30 , 31 . After PSP introduction, the band diagram had a favourable flattened alignment, mitigating energy losses of charge carriers within perovskite films (Fig.
3f ). The findings from transient adsorption measurements align with the conclusion obtained from energy band alignment (Extended Data Fig.
6 ). Moreover, we tested the built-in electrical field ( V bi ) in a p–i–n device. The improved
V bi
was beneficial for carrier diffusion as well (Supplementary Fig.
20 ). Device performance We fabricated devices with a p–i–n stack of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(triaryl)amine (PTAA)/FA 0.95 Cs 0.05 PbI 3 /C 60 /bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag. The bandgap of this perovskite recipe was determined to be 1.51 eV by the Tauc plot method (Supplementary Figs.
21 ) and by using the derivative of the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the solar cell (Extended Data Fig.
7 ). The champion device yielded a notable PCE of up to 26.09%/25.16% (reverse/forward scan direction) whereas the reference cell had PCEs of 24.62%/23.48% (Fig.
4a ). The corresponding steady-state power output efficiencies were 25.15% and 23.72%, respectively. An unencapsulated device achieved certified PCEs of 25.8% and 25.2% for the reverse scan and for the steady-state output, as certified by an independent organization (Supplementary Fig.
22 ). The fill factor of the champion device exceeded 85%, which is nearly 95% of the theoretical limit (89.5%). We attributed the remarkable fill factor improvement to the improved charge carrier extraction, which is supported by the efficiency improvement in the n–i–p configuration as well (Supplementary Fig.
23 ). The open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) improved from 1.145 to 1.164 V, which is consistent with the reduced trap density. The short-circuit current density ( J SC ) over 26 mA cm −2
was consistent with the integrated
J SC
extracted from the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) (Fig.
4b ). The reproducibility was evaluated using a batch of devices comprising 16 individuals for each set-up (Supplementary Fig.
25 ). We further tested the solar cells in a light-emitting diode (LED) mode. The LED EQE EL
improved from 7.1% to 9.7% (Fig.
4c ), so that the emission peaks were around 820 nm (Supplementary Fig.
26 ). We fabricated devices with an upscaled area of 1 cm 2 , and the efficiency improved from 21.78% to 23.64% (Fig.
4d ). This improvement was mainly associated with the enhanced fill factor. Further devices with typical efficient perovskite formulas were fabricated to assess the universality of the PSP strategy (Supplementary Figs.
27 – 29 ), although some perovskite formulas still require further evaluation. Fig. 4: Device performance and stability. a ,

e , Normalized evolution of the PCE for unencapsulated reference and PSP devices under continuous tracking at the maximum power point following the ISOS L-1I protocol. The initial PCEs of the reference and PSP devices were 25.40% and 23.54%, respectively. RT, room temperature.
f , Results of damp-heat reliability tests of the encapsulated devices tested at 85 °C and 85% relative humidity (RH) following the ISOS D-3 protocol. A device stack based on ITO/PTAA/perovskite/C 60 /Au was used in the damp-heat tests. The solid lines represent the average PCE for six individual devices. The initial average PCEs of the reference and PSP devices were 19.2% and 21.8%. The error bars denote the standard deviation. champ., champion; FF, fill factor. Full size image Device reliability was evaluated following the procedure specified in the ISOS protocols 32 . An unencapsulated PSP-treated device retained 92% of its initial PCE after 2,500 h of continuous tracking at the maximum power point in a nitrogen atmosphere. By contrast, the PCE of the reference device dropped to around 80% of its initial value under the same conditions (Fig.
4e ). Damp-heat experiments were conducted using encapsulated devices in an ageing box with 85 °C and 85% relative humidity. The PSP-treated device exhibited almost 90% efficiency after over 300 h on average, compared with around 80% for the initial PCE of the reference (Fig.
4f ). Regarding the temperature cycling reliability, the encapsulated PSP-treated device retained 93% of its initial PCE after 300 cycles, compared to 67% for the reference (Extended Data Fig.
8 ). Overall, these findings provide an in-depth understanding of phase segregation and suggest a promising strategy for accelerating commercialization of perovskite photovoltaics. Methods Materials Lead iodide (PbI 2 , 99.999%), lead bromide (PbBr 2 , 99.999%), caesium iodide (CsI, 99.999%), bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (Li-TFSI, 99.95%) and 4-tert-butylpyridine were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Formamidinium iodide, methylammonium (MA) bromide and methylammonium chloride (MACl) were synthesized in house by reacting equal molar amounts of formamidine (FA) acetate and methylamine alcohol solution with the corresponding halogen acid 33 . PSP was synthesized in a laboratory according to the method mentioned in the  Supplementary Information . PTAA, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) and BCP were purchased from Lumtec. Tin (IV) oxide (SnO 2 , 15% in H 2 O colloidal dispersion) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Fullerene (C 60 ) was purchased from Nano-C. All solvents used in the experiments, including
N , N -dimethylformamide (99.8%), dimethyl sulfoxide (anhydrous, 99.9%), chlorobenzene (anhydrous, 99.8%), acetonitrile (99.9%) and isopropyl alcohol (anhydrous, 99.8%), were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. All chemicals were used as received without any further purification. Perovskite precursor solution The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving FAPbI 3
(1.71 M) powder and CsPbI 3
powder (0.09 M) in a mixture of the solvents dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulfoxide (8:1 v/v). 0.5% MAPbBr 3
powder, 7.2% PbI 2
and 30% MACl with molar ratio were added to increase the crystallinity 34 . For a solution with PSP agents, PSP powder was directly added into the perovskite precursor solution with different concentrations. PSP at 1.2, 2.4 and 4.8 mg ml −1
was added to perovskite precursors for comparison (denoted as PSP-1.2, PSP-2.4 and PSP-4.8, respectively). The obtained precursor was vigorously shaken at room temperature for over 3 h. Finally, the perovskite precursor solutions were filtered through 0.22 μm polytetrafluoroethylene filters before use. Device fabrication The devices with the p–i–n configuration were fabricated as follows. Prepatterned ITO-coated glass substrates (7 Ω per square) were cleaned by sequential ultrasonication in detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol each for 15 min, respectively. The cleaned substrates were dried under a flow of clean N 2
and further dried in a 60 °C oven overnight. Before depositing the hole transport layer, the substrates were exposed to oxygen plasma cleaner for 5 min and then transferred into an N 2
glovebox immediately for rest deposition progress. PTAA solution (2.5 mg ml −1
dissolved in chlorobenzene) was spin-coated onto the substrate at 6,000 rpm for 30 s, then annealed at 100 °C for 15 min. The perovskite layer was deposited by one-step spin-coating of the filtered precursor solution at 1,000 rpm for 10 s and 4,000 rpm for 40 s. Then 200 μl of chlorobenzene was quickly dropped onto the centre of the spinning substrate at 15 s before the end. The film was immediately annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. After cooling down to room temperature, 100 μl of phenethylammonium iodide or
n -octylammonium iodide solution (5 mg ml −1 ) was dynamically coated onto the perovskite films at 3,000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 5 min. The device fabrication was accomplished after sequential thermal evaporation of C 60
(30 nm, 0.1 Å s −1 ), BCP (7 nm, 0.1 Å s −1 ) and Ag (100 nm, 0.2 Å s −1 ) in a high-vacuum chamber (7 × 10 −5  Pa). Note that all procedures for device fabrication were conducted in a nitrogen glovebox (O 2
and H 2 O less than 0.1 ppm). The devices with the n–i–p configuration were fabricated as follows. After the same pretreatment of the ITO substrates, SnO 2
in a colloidal dispersion (diluted by 1:4 v/v with deionized H 2 O) was spin-coated onto the substrates at 3,000 rpm for 30 s, and sequentially annealed at 180 °C for 50 min in air (35% relative humidity). The procedures for perovskite film deposition were the same as those for the p–i–n devices. A solution of hole transport material was prepared 30 min before use by mixing spiro-OMeTAD (91 mg) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (36 μl) in chlorobenzene (1 ml). Li-TFSI (23 μl, 520 mg ml −1
in acetonitrile) was doped to improve its conductivity. 50 μl of the solution of hole transport material was dynamically spin-coated onto the perovskite films at 3,000 rpm for 30 s in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. Finally, gold electrodes (100 nm, 0.2 Å s −1 ) were deposited through thermal evaporation. Photovoltaic performance characterization The
J–V
measurements were carried out with a xenon lamp-based solar simulator (Enlitech SS-F5-3A, Class AAA) and a source meter (Keithley 2400). The simulated AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm −2 ) was calibrated by a standard silicon cell (traced to NREL, SRC-2020). The solar cells were measured with a metal mask with an area of 7.485 mm 2
to accurately define the active area. The voltage was applied from −0.2 to 1.3 V with a scanning rate of 0.2 V s −1 , and the voltage step was 20 mV. All devices were measured immediately after fabrication in an N 2
glovebox. The IPCE was measured in a.c. mode on the xenon lamp-based system (Newport TLS260-300X). The scan range was from 300 to 1,000 nm. The solar cells were measured in LED mode in N 2
using a home-made motorized goniometer set-up consisting of a source meter unit (Keithley 2400), a calibrated Si photodiode (FDS-100-CAL, Thorlabs), a pico-ammeter (4140B, Agilent) and a calibrated fibre optic spectrophotometer (UVN-SR, StellarNet Inc.). The distance between the LED device and the photodetector was 59.5 mm. Stability characterization A home-made calibrated LED-based solar simulator with an intensity of 100 mW cm −2
was used as an illumination source in the stability tests. The tracking of the maximum power point was performed in N 2.
A blower was used to ensure the device was at a constant temperature. A home-made system was used to acquire the continuous power evolution. Devices for the damp-heat test were encapsulated with epoxy. The Ag electrodes were replaced by Au, and BCP was removed from the device. The damp-heat tests and thermal cycling tests were conducted in a customized ageing box. The accuracies of the temperature and humidity were under ±1 °C and ±5%, respectively. The damp-heat tests were periodically performed during the
J–V
scan after cooling down in N 2
for around 30 min. The thermal cycling tests were carried out by repeatedly performing the
J–V
characterization after the stages for stabilizing the temperature. Cross-sectional microstructure characterization Note that all measurements, unless otherwise specified, were conducted with a perovskite formulation of FA 0.95 Cs 0.05 PbI 3 . The samples were prepared with ITO/PTAA/perovskite/PTAA/Cu stacks, in which a higher concentration of PTAA solution (30 mg ml −1
in chlorobenzene) and thermally evaporated copper (200 nm, 0.2 Å s −1 ) were used. Thick layers of PTAA and copper on the perovskite films can protect the samples from milling damage 35 . The other procedures were the same as in device fabrication apart from the absence of surface passivation. Pt and carbon layers were deposited before thinning using focused ion beam (FIB) equipment (ThermoFisher Helios 5 CX). A thick plate was extracted from the bulk sample at 30 kV and 3,000–30,000 pA, which was welded onto a Cu grid (omniprobe grid) by a probing system. The thick plate was first thinned at 30 kV and 50–1,000 pA and then at a lower current of 10–30 pA. Finally, the specimen was completed by thinning at a lower voltage of 1 kV and 30–50 pA after beam showering at 3 kV and 10–30 pA. The samples were immediately transferred to a TEM system (ThermoFisher Talos F200S). High-angle annular dark-field images across the full cross section of the samples and high-resolution TEM images were collected at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Structure characterization XRD and GIXRD data were acquired from a diffractometer (SmartLab, Rigaku) using Cu Kα ( λ  = 1.5406 Å) radiation. The tests were performed by scanning 2 θ
of 5°–45° with a scan rate of 3° min −1
and 0.02° per step. The GIXRD tests detected signals from the bottom side of the perovskite films at grazing incident angles of 0.1°, 0.4°, 0.8°, 1°, 2°, 3°, 4° and 5°. The corresponding penetration depths for the perovskite material were calculated 36
as described in the  Supplementary Information . Depth profiling characterization The depth profiles of perovskite deposited onto ITO substrates were recorded using a ToF-SIMS system (TOF-SIMS 5, ION-TOF) with a Bi 3+
primary beam (25 keV, 1 pA) and an oxygen sputter beam (1 keV, 45 nA). Note that an oxygen sputter gun can help in expelling pollution from the perovskite surface 37 . Samples were prepared with the full solar cell configuration for the depth-dependent photoelectron spectroscopy with an integrated etching system (ThermoFisher, ESCALAB Xi + ). Synchrotron radiation characterization Pb L III -edge EXAFS data were collected on the BL13SSW beamline at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) using the top-up mode operation with a ring current of 200 mA at 3.5 GeV. From the high-intensity X-ray photons of the multipole wiggler source, monochromatic X-ray beams could be obtained using a liquid-nitrogen-cooled double-crystal monochromator with a Si(111) crystal pair. For each grazing incident angle, X-ray absorption spectra were recorded in fluorescence mode using an N 2 /Ar mixed-gas-filled ionization chamber and passivated implanted planar silicon (Canberra Co.) for the incident and fluorescent X-ray photons, respectively. Higher-order harmonic contamination was eliminated by detuning to reduce the incident X-ray intensity by about 30%. The energy calibration was performed with a Pb foil reference using the Athena package 38 . Fourier-transformed radial distribution functions of k3-weighted Pb L III -edge EXAFS spectra
k 3 χ ( k ) were obtained in the
k
range between 3.0 and 9.0 Å −1
through a standard XAFS data-analysis process. In situ GIWAXS tests were performed at the beamlines BL14B1 and BL17B1 of SSRF. A two-dimensional detector (Rayonix MX300) was used to capture 360-frame spectra with 2 s intervals during spin-coating. Chlorobenzene dripping was automatically controlled in this experiment. Other characterizations The ultraviolet to visible absorption spectra were acquired with a spectrophotometer (Lambda 365, PerkinElmer). The photoluminescence and time-resolved photoluminescence were measured with a spectrofluorometer (Horiba Fluorolog-3 system). The excitation wavelength for the photoluminescence was 480 nm. The time-resolved photoluminescence was measured using a 532 nm laser nano-LED as an excitation source. All samples were deposited onto quartz glass. The morphology images were collected by a scanning electron microscope (Gemini SEM 500, Zeiss). The Mott–Schottky plots were measured with an applied bias range from −0.1 to 1.2 V. The built-in potential was determined using the equation
\({\left(\frac{A}{C}\right)}^{2}=\frac{2}{q{\varepsilon }_{{\rm{r}}}{\varepsilon }_{0}{N}_{{\rm{D}}}}({V}_{{\rm{bi}}}-V)\)
where

q

V bi

N D
the carrier density. The depletion width was calculated using
\(W={\left(\frac{2{\varepsilon }_{{\rm{r}}}{\varepsilon }_{0}}{{N}_{{\rm{D}}}}{V}_{{\rm{bi}}}\right)}^{1/2}\) . The capacitance–frequency curves were measured over a frequency range from 10 1
to 10 6  Hz using an electrochemical workstation (Zahner IM6ex). An a.c. amplitude voltage of 5 mV was used, and the d.c. bias was kept at 0 V to avoid the influence of the ferroelectric effect. The final trap density of states was calculated using
\({\rm{tDOS}}({E}_{\omega })=-\frac{{\rm{d}}C}{{\rm{d}}\omega }\frac{{V}_{{\rm{bi}}}}{qW}\frac{\omega }{{k}_{{\rm{B}}}T}\)
where

T . Computational details All the spin theoretical simulations in our work were carried out with the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) v.5.4.4. The generalized gradient approximation with the Perdew–Burke–Emzerhof functional form was employed to evaluate the electron–electron exchange and correlation interactions. Projector augmented-wave methods were implanted to represent the core-electron (valence electron) interactions. The plane-wave basis function was set with a kinetic cutoff energy of 550 eV. The ground-state atomic geometries were optimized by relaxing the force below 0.02 eV/Å and the convergence criteria for energy was set with a value of 1.0 × 10 −5  eV per cell. The Brillouin zone was sampled using Monkhorst–Pack meshes of size 5 × 5 × 1 for the slab models. All slab models were modelled with a 20 Å vacuum layer. Gaussian smearing was employed for the stress/force relaxations. To better describe the interactions between molecules, van der Waal interactions were included with the zero damping DFT-D3 method of Grimme. The transition states during the reaction pathway were evaluated with the climbing-image nudged elastic band method. The convergence criteria for force were below 0.05 eV/Å. Only the gamma point was considered in this calculation.

Extended data figures and tables Extended Data Fig. 1 Illustration of peel-off method to expose the bottom of perovskite films. We prepared sample comprising ITO/PTAA/Perovskite/Cu stacks for GIXRD measurements. PTAA (30 mg ml −1
in CB) was deposited as sacrifice layer to further expose bottom interface, and Cu layer was evaporated to ensure the completeness of perovskite films. After fabrication, the samples were immersed in a tank filled with CB for 20 min in a nitrogen glovebox. Along with dissolving of PTAA layer, an entire perovskite film together with Cu would float in CB. A clean quartz substrate was used for flipping and carrying the obtained films. The samples should be immersed in CB again for another 5 min to clear potential PTAA residues. Finally, the samples were dried naturally in nitrogen and for further characterizations of bottom interface. It should be noted that, immersion in CB within 1 h would not affect perovskite structure. To ensure the reliability for these results, the controlled trial was conducted with perovskite films deposited on quartz glass. We tested conventional XRD measurements for the perovskite surface, which demonstrated identical results of 1 h immersed perovskite films.

Time-resolved absorption at the ground-state bleach (GSB) of 780 nm revealed a decrease in the fast decay lifetime (τ 1 ) and an increase in the slow decay lifetime (τ 2 ). The five-fold reduction in τ 1
suggests effective passivation, while the nearly three-fold increase in τ 2
implies a seamless carrier diffusion within the perovskite (Supplementary Table

Abstract Achieving both high efficiency and long-term stability is the key to the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) 1 , 2 . However, the diversity of perovskite (ABX 3 ) compositions and phases makes it challenging to fabricate high-quality films 3 , 4 , 5 . Perovskite formation relies on the reaction between AX and BX 2 , whereas most conventional methods for film-growth regulation are based solely on the interaction with the BX 2
component. Herein, we demonstrate an alternative approach to modulate reaction kinetics by anion–π interaction between AX and hexafluorobenzene (HFB). Notably, these two approaches are independent but work together to establish ‘dual-site regulation’, which achieves a delicate control over the reaction between AX and BX 2
without unwanted intermediates. The resultant formamidinium lead halides (FAPbI 3 ) films exhibit fewer defects, redshifted absorption and high phase purity without detectable nanoscale δ phase. Consequently, we achieved PSCs with power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 26.07% for a 0.08-cm 2
device (25.8% certified) and 24.63% for a 1-cm 2
device. The device also kept 94% of its initial PCE after maximum power point (MPP) tracking for 1,258 h under full-spectrum AM 1.5 G sunlight at 50 ± 5 °C. This method expands the range of chemical interactions that occur in perovskite precursors by exploring anion–π interactions and highlights the importance of the AX component as a new and effective working site to improved photovoltaic devices with high quality and phase purity.

Main Recently, metal halide perovskites (ABX 3 ) have emerged as promising materials for various applications, especially photovoltaics. The PCE of PSCs has rapidly increased to 26.1% (ref.  6 ). However, maintaining their performance during long-term operation is still challenging, especially in accelerated ageing 7 , owing to the complex chemical landscape with respect to composition and phase in perovskites 1 , 2 , 8 . The resultant films present multiscale imperfections, such as point defects, component heterogeneity, undesirable residues, multiscale secondary phases and so on 3 , 4 , 5 . These lead to less optimal optical bandgap, adverse optoelectronic response and even material degradation 9 , 10 , 11 . Moreover, even in high-quality FAPbI 3
films for state-of-art devices, detrimental nanoscale phase impurities are discovered 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 . Thus, it is urgently needed to further improve the quality of perovskite materials by minimizing multiscale impurities, especially nanoscale phase impurity, which receives limited attention. The formation of perovskite film by means of the solution process is quick with vigorous reaction and diffusion, which often involves intermediate phases 16 . Modulating precursor chemistry enables complete transformation to photoactive α phase or suppression of photoinactive δ intermediate phases. The formation of perovskite could be regarded as the reaction between AX and BX 2 . In this regard, electron donors such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) 16 , N-methylpyrrolidone 17 , Cl −
(ref.  18 ), formate (Fa − ) 19
and thiocyanate (SCN − ) 20
are intensively investigated, which coordinate with electron-accepting metal cation at the B site (Pb 2+
and Sn 2+ ) to retard nucleation and influence crystal growth substantially 19 , which we refer to as the BX 2
retardants. However, commonly used electron donors such as DMSO or methylammonium chloride (MACl) only allows partial elimination of nanoscale δ-phase impurities, whereas stronger electron donors can bring in secondary phases and residuals owing to relatively strong interaction but mild crystal-growth conditions 19 , 21 . We proposed that, as well as merely interacting with BX 2
by using electron-donating molecules, interacting with electron-donating AX synergically by using a new type of retardants (which we refer to as the AX retardants) with electron-accepting capability may give rise to the further elaborate regulation of perovskite fabrication (as shown in Fig.
1a ). However, so far, no attempts have succeeded in achieving state-of-art PSCs with the AX component as a working site for film-growth regulation. Fortunately, we find that anion–π interaction could be used as such AX retardants. Fig. 1: Schematic illustration and experimental investigation of anion–π interactions. a , Schematic illustration of using extra anion–π interactions as the AX retardant in perovskite processing.

Full size image The anion–π interaction between FAI and HFB Anion–π interactions generally occur between an electron-deficient (π-acidic) aromatic system and an anion, and the intensity mainly relies on electrostatic forces and anion-induced polarization 22 . Earlier studies showed that the anion–π interaction between fullerene derivatives in perovskite induces n-doping of fullerene derivatives and cause passivation of defects 23 , 24 . With six strong electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms on the arene, HFB has an overwhelming electron deficiency with large positive quadrupole moment up to +9.5 B, which leads to stronger anion–π interaction 25 . Accordingly, the anion–π bond strength was found to be 0.53 eV (51 kJ mol −1 ) between HFB and iodide 26 , which was on the same order of magnitude as DMSO–PbI 2
coordination 27 . In the coordination process, BX 2
functions as an acceptor and retardants serve as donors; conversely, in the anion–π interaction, AX acts as a donor and HFB serves as an acceptor. Therefore, both AX and BX 2
components could interact with their retardants, realizing dual-site regulation of perovskite growth. We use FAPbI 3
as the platform to study the anion–π interaction during film growth. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Fig.
1a ) showed that the iodine anion interacted favourably with HFB with overlapping electron clouds, wherein the distance between iodine and carbon (3.58 Å) is shorter than the sum of their van der Waals radii. Neither HFB nor FAI/isopropyl alcohol (IPA) solution showed fluorescence at 500–560 nm (Fig.
1b ). However, when HFB was introduced to the FAI/IPA solution, a new emission peak appeared at 545 nm, suggesting that a complex is probably formed. Spectrometric titration results show that the strongest emission appears when the molar ratio [HFB]/([HFB] + [FAI]) equals 0.2, implying the complex formation between 4FAI and 1HFB. We further performed ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption measurement (Fig.
1c ). FAI and HFB showed absorption edges at 260 nm and 280 nm, respectively, but the HFB and FAI mixture showed a much redshifted absorption edge to 325 nm, which indicated the charge transfer between iodide and HFB. Also, in Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR; Extended Data Fig.
1a ), the skeletal vibration of FA +
at 1,703 cm −1
and stretching vibration of –NH 2
in FA +
at 3,355 cm −1
both shifted to higher wavenumber with the addition of HFB (1,722 cm −1
and 3,400 cm −1 , respectively). This is probably because the N–H ⋯ I hydrogen bond between FA+ and I− was weakened by HFB. It was also confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H NMR) (Extended Data Fig.
1b ), in which the FAI showed a prominent shift to higher field (Δδ = −0.3 ppm) after HFB addition. The formation of FAI–HFB complex reduces the chemical potential of FAI, as tested by cyclic voltammetry measurement in Extended Data Fig.
1c . We then studied how HFB affects the reaction between FAI and PbI 2 . As shown in Fig.
1d , bare PbI 2
in dimethylformamide (DMF) showed an absorption peak at 285 nm related to PbI + (DMF) 28 . When adding FAI to PbI 2
solution, absorption peaks related to PbI 2 (DMF) and PbI 3 − (DMF) located at 325 nm and 370 nm appeared. However, on introducing HFB, the PbI 3 − (DMF) peak disappeared and the PbI 2 (DMF) peak decreased considerably. This indicated that the interaction between iodine and lead could be substantially inhibited with HFB. DFT calculations were taken among possible reactions in the FAI ⋯ HFB ⋯ PbI 2
three-component system, as shown below $${\rm{FAI}}+{\rm{HFB}}\to {{\rm{FA}}}^{+}+{\left[{\rm{I}}\cdots {\rm{HFB}}\right]}^{-}$$
(1)
$${\rm{FAI}}+{{\rm{PbI}}}_{2}\to {{\rm{FA}}}^{+}+{\left[{{\rm{PbI}}}_{3}\right]}^{-}$$

$${\left[{{\rm{PbI}}}_{3}\right]}^{-}+{\rm{HFB}}\to {\left[{{\rm{PbI}}}_{3}\cdots {\rm{HFB}}\right]}^{-}$$
(3)
in which reaction 1 refers to the interaction between FAI and HFB and reaction 2 refers to the interaction between FAI and PbI 2 . The Gibbs energy of reaction 1 (−89.7 kcal mol −1 ) is markedly lower than that of reaction 2 (−53.1 kcal mol −1 ), indicating that FAI has a stronger interaction with HFB rather than PbI 2 . Although HFB can also interact with the product of reaction 2 ([PbI 3 ] − ), the Gibbs energy of this reaction (reaction 3) is too small (−2.51 kcal mol −1 ) to cancel out the energy difference between reaction 1 and reaction 2. The DFT calculations were performed in gas phase (Fig.
1e ) and the implicit solvent model (Extended Data Fig.
2 ), yielding consistent results. Thus, HFB could react with FAI to form [FAI ⋯ HFB] and retard the reaction between FAI and PbI 2 . We quantitatively study this retarding effect. The PbI 2
films immersed in FAI/IPA showed fast initial weight gain and soon reached saturation, as tested by quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D; Fig.
1f , upper panel), which is possibly because of the formation of δ-FAPbI 3
that impeded further diffusion of FAI 29 . By contrast, PbI 2
in FAI–HFB/IPA solution showed much less weight gain at the beginning but no apparent saturation. Also, 3.6% of FAI was consumed in the FAI/IPA solution, whereas only 1.2% of FAI was consumed in the FAI–HFB/IPA solution for the first 30 s, which was measured using an inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer (Fig.
1f , lower panel). These results show that the reaction rate between FAI and PbI 2
could be effectively retarded by HFB. As well as FAI, the UV–vis results showed that anion–π-interaction-induced polarization appears in other I − -based compounds (MAI and CsI) regardless of the cation and in different anions, such as Br − , and even pseudohalogen anion SCN −
(Extended Data Fig.
3 ). Effect of HFB on perovskite film growth In situ UV–vis absorption measurement was implemented to investigate the FAPbI 3
formation process. We refer to the perovskite samples fabricated without and with HFB as the ‘control’ samples and the ‘HFB’ samples, respectively. Figure
2a,b
shows the differential of in situ absorption of PbI 2 ·DMSO films immersed in (FAI + MACl)/IPA solution and (FAI + MACl)/(IPA + HFB) solution for 1 h, respectively. The control sample exhibited an absorption threshold at 470 nm, with the maximum differential at 450 nm (Fig.
2a,c ) corresponding to δ-FAPbI 3 , which is absent in the HFB sample (Fig.
2b,c ). The absorption of the control sample was almost unchanged after the initial 10 min, although the transformation to perovskite phase in the HFB sample was slow but continuous (Supplementary Fig.
1 ), which suggests complete transformation from PbI 2 ·DMSO to perovskites. Fig. 2: Influence of anion–π interactions on film formation. a , b , Differential of UV–vis absorption spectra evolution with time for lead iodide films immersed in FAI dissolved in IPA ( a ) or IPA + HFB ( b ).

2d–g , the broad scattering peak at
q  ≈ 15 nm −1
probably originated from solvent (IPA or mixed IPA and HFB) and the sharp diffraction peaks at
q  = 10.2 nm −1
and 8.6 nm −1
represent the α-phase perovskite and 6H phase of δ-FAPbI 3 , respectively. The solvent peak took 30 s and 12 s for the HFB and control samples, respectively, to lose half of their initial intensity. Thermal gravimetric analysis also implies more solvent residue in HFB perovskite precursor films below 70 °C (Supplementary Fig.
2 ). As the volatilization rate of HFB was much faster than that of IPA at room temperature (Supplementary Videos  1
and
2 ), the solvent residue more likely originates from the strong interaction between HFB and FAI. In the control sample, δ-FAPbI 3
and α-phase perovskite was observed immediately after organic salts were deposited (Fig.
2h ). The α-phase peak was located at 10.2 nm −1 , higher than the peak at 9.8 nm −1
for α-FAPbI 3
(ref.  30 ), which was attributed to the incorporation of MACl into the α-FAPbI 3
lattice 18 . Surprisingly, in the HFB sample, the δ-FAPbI 3
and α phase was absent in the first 30 s and 18 s. Different from the absorption results, some δ-FAPbI 3
still appeared in the HFB sample after 30 s, which might be associated with the moisture-induced degradation, along with solvent evaporation 29 . These results indicate that the addition of HFB could retard the reaction between FAI and PbI 2
at room temperature, which consequently suppressed the formation of δ-FAPbI 3
or other crystalline intermediate phase. On heating, HFB escapes from the film, which allows more direct formation of crystalline α-FAPbI 3
from wet film with much reduced side reaction. This dual-site regulation is different from previous methods that suppress δ-FAPbI 3
by forming another stable intermediate phase or accelerate sufficient transformation from δ-FAPbI 3
to α-FAPbI 3
(refs.  16 , 18 , 20 ). Effect of HFB on final perovskite films X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on the final HFB films (Supplementary Fig.
3 ) shows negligible F1s signal, indicating that HFB has escaped from the perovskite films completely after annealing. Thus, the changes of the final films probably originated from the crystallization process. The HFB sample showed narrower diffraction peaks for α-FAPbI 3 , as measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Supplementary Fig.
4 ) and GIWAXS (Fig.
3a,b
and Supplementary Fig.
5 ). Besides, an increase in grain size from about 200 nm to more than 1 μm by the addition of HFB is clearly observed in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig.
3c,d ). Fig. 3: Influence of anion–π interactions on final FAPbI 3

g , TEM of HFB perovskite on a smaller scale. Scale bar, 2 nm. Full size image Although there are no obvious diffraction signals corresponding to crystalline δ-FAPbI 3
observed in the control and HFB films, it is documented that nanoscale δ-FAPbI 3
domains (for example, nuclei) cannot be accurately detected by XRD, owing to the lack of long-range order 13 , 15 . Accordingly, low-temperature absorption of the control sample showed oscillatory features located around 700 nm at 80 K (Fig.
3e ), implying the existence of nanoscale impurities 13 . On HFB addition, the oscillatory features disappeared. These structural differences were further confirmed using extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurement. As shown in Fig.
3f , a new peak was found at 3.92 Å in
R
space for the control sample, which is consistent with the distance between the adjacent lead atoms in the face-sharing PbI 6
octahedral structure 31 . Given that the same peak at 3.92 Å in
R
space was discovered in δ-FAPbI 3
single crystals, we consider that this peak originated from the δ-FAPbI 3
structure. Notably, such a peak was absent in the HFB sample. This confirms that nanoscale impurity exists in the FAPbI 3
perovskite fabricated from conventional precursors (FAPbI 3  + MACl) and could be inhibited by the addition of HFB. In transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements, δ-FAPbI 3
was not found in the entire region (Supplementary Fig.
6 ), which visually illustrates the phase purity of the HFB sample. A typical α-FAPbI 3
lattice was clearly seen in the enlarged image (Fig.
3g ). However, the control sample was found to contain some diffraction pattern related to the δ-FAPbI 3
region (Supplementary Fig.
7 ). Furthermore, the bandgaps of the HFB and control samples were estimated to be 1.52 and 1.54 eV, respectively, using a Tauc plot (Supplementary Fig.
8 ). The absorption threshold for the HFB sample reached more than 825 nm with increased absorbance. This probably originated from the reduced MA cation residue from MACl additives, as revealed by
1 H NMR and secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) mapping (Supplementary Figs.
9
and
10 ). The HFB sample also showed 2.5 times higher photoluminescence (PL) intensity and longer carrier lifetimes (2.1 μs) than control films (1.3 μs), which suggests lower defect density (Supplementary Figs.
11
and
12 ). A similar trend was also found for other widely adopted perovskite components with HFB, indicating that HFB can regulate the formation process of various perovskites, as shown in Supplementary Figs.
13 – 15 . Performance of perovskite devices with HFB We then fabricated PSCs (FTO/SnO 2 /FAPbI 3 /spiro-OMeTAD/Au). The best HFB device (0.0831 cm 2 ) achieved a PCE of 26.07% in forward scan and 26.01% in reverse scan, giving 26.04% on average (Fig.
4a
and Extended Data Table
1 ). A best stabilized power output of 25.9% was achieved. By contrast, the PCE of control PSCs achieved 24.81% in reverse scan. Statistical analyses on 100 individual devices with or without HFB were summarized. The PCE for HFB achieved 25.65% on average compared with 24.53% for the control (Fig.
4b
and Supplementary Fig.
17 ). A certified 25.8% PCE was achieved with no hysteresis at the National Institute of Metrology, China (NIM) (Supplementary Figs.
18
and
19 ). The improvement of efficiency mainly comes from current density and open-circuit voltage. We determined the radiative limit for the open-circuit voltage ( \({V}_{{\rm{OC}}}^{{\rm{rad}}}\) ) from the external quantum efficiency and electroluminescent spectrum (EQE-EQE EL ) (Fig.
4c ), with 1.236 V and 1.254 V for the HFB and control samples, respectively, thus non-radiative
V OC
loss was calculated to be 0.043 V and 0.076 V for each sequentially. The enhancement in
J SC
is confirmed using EQE measurement (Supplementary Fig.
20 ). We also investigate the three following molecules by forming anion–π interactions with halogen: 2,4,6-trifluoro-1,3,5-triazine, s-tetrazine and pentafluoropyridine, which take effects similarly as HFB, as shown in Extended Data Fig.

h , Thermal stability of control and HFB PSCs. Full size image We also fabricated PSCs with larger areas (1.003 cm 2 ) and the best-performing device exhibited a PCE of 25.12%, with a high
V OC
of 1.205 V in reverse scan and 24.13% in forward scan (24.63% on average), which is the highest PCE ever reported for a 1-cm 2
device so far. PL mapping of perovskite films was performed and the HFB film was found to be more uniform (Fig.
4e,f ), which might be of benefit to larger-area PSCs. The control FAPbI 3
films remained at only 45% of its initial absorbance on average for ten films, after ageing under humidity (relative humidity (RH) 50–60%) at room temperature (approximately 20 °C) for 72 h (Supplementary Fig.
21 ), although 82% of their initial absorption remained for HFB films on average. One of the best HFB films remained at 95% of its initial absorption after 120 h (Supplementary Fig.
22 ). We further investigated the operational stability of these PSCs by ageing them under nitrogen atmosphere, using MPP tracking with 1-sun illumination at 50 ± 5 °C with a spectral mismatch lower than 2% to AM 1.5 G (Supplementary Fig.
23 ). As shown in Fig.
4g , the PCE of the control PSCs decreased by 30% after 600 h, whereas the HFB devices remained at 94% of its initial efficiency after 1,258 h. We further studied their stability at 85 °C (Fig.
4h ). Control PSCs retained an average of 88.3% of their initial efficiency after 1,255 h for 12 devices. Devices with HFB retained 91.8% of their initial efficiency on average for 12 devices. The enhanced heat resistance might be understood as reduced MA cation residue in HFB perovskite. Overall, we have shown that the growth of halide perovskites can be substantially regulated by anion–π interaction with halide in the AX component, which is independently conducted but works well together with BX 2
regulation, leading to dual-site regulation. Particularly, it inhibits formation of δ-FAPbI 3
and reduces component residue in α-FAPbI 3
perovskite, which improves component and phase purity, especially without detectable nanoscale phase impurity. Furthermore, because anion–π interactions widely present between electron-deficient systems and anions, these findings and methodologies may be extended to other solution-processed compound materials with electron-donating anions. Methods Materials SnO 2
colloid precursor (tin(IV) oxide, 15% in H 2 O colloidal dispersion), hydroiodic acid (HI, 57 wt% in water) and HFB was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Tin(II) chloride dihydrate (99.995%), thioglycolic acid, PbI 2
(99.999%), CsI (99.9%), N,N-dimethylformamide (99.9%), DMSO (99.5%), isopropanol (99.5%), chlorobenzene (99.8%), 4-tert-butylpyridine (98%) and acetonitrile (99.8%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Spiro-OMeTAD (99.8%), tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)-cobalt(III)tris(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) salt (FK209), poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) was purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology in China. Hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37 wt% in water) and methylamine water solution was purchased from Beijing Tongguang Fine Chemical Company. Formamidine acetate was purchased from MACKLIN. FTO substrate was purchased from Yingkou OPV Tech New Energy Co., Ltd. Materials synthesis MACl and FAI were synthesized using the methods reported previously. The details are as follows: 16 ml methylamine water solution (0.1 mol) or 8.8 g formamidine acetate (0.1 mol) was added to a 100-ml three-neck flask immersed in a water/ice bath. A certain amount (0.1 mol) of HX acid was slowly dropped into the bottle with continuous stirring. The mixture was refluxed for 2 h under a N 2
atmosphere. Subsequently, the solution was concentrated to a dry solid by using rotary evaporation at 80 °C. This crude product was redissolved into 20 ml ethanol, then 100 μl diethyl ether was slowly dropped along the bottle wall and a white product deposited. This recrystallization was repeated three times and the obtained precipitate was dried in a vacuum oven for 10 h at 40 °C. The final products were sealed in a N 2 -filled glovebox for future use. Solar cell device fabrication The FTO or ITO substrate was cleaned with ultrapure water, acetone, ethanol and isopropanol successively. For highly efficient PSCs, SnO 2
was deposited in a chemical bath, similar to a previous report 32 , and annealed at 150 °C for 60 min in air. For the stability test, a SnO 2
nanocrystal solution was spin-coated on the ITO substrate at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s to form a 50-nm-thick film, which was then annealed at 150 °C for 60 min in air. The perovskite film was fabricated by a two-step solution process: the PbI 2
(1.5 M, dissolved in DMF/DMSO (9:1, v/v)) was spin-coated on SnO 2
at 1,500 r.p.m. for 30 s. Organic cation solution (FAI 0.55 M; MACl 0.12 M) was spin-coated at 2,100 r.p.m. for 30 s and then annealed at 170 °C for 10 min in a dehumidified box (RH < 30%). The organic cation was dissolved in isopropanol for reference perovskite or a mixture of isopropanol/HFB (945:55, 890:110, 835:165 and 780:220, v/v for 1HFB, 2HFB, 3HFB and 4HFB, as optimized in Supplementary Fig.
16 ) for HFB-treated perovskite. Phenylethanamine salt (20 mM) was spin-coated onto the perovskite films at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. Then the HTM solution, in which a spiro-OMeTAD/chlorobenzene (72.3 mg ml −1 ) solution was used with the addition of 35 μl Li-TFSI/acetonitrile (260 mg ml −1 ) and 30 μl 4-tert-butylpyridine, was deposited by spin-coating at 3,500 r.p.m. for 30 s. The device was finished by thermal evaporation of Au (80 nm) under vacuum. For the operational stability test inside the glovebox, a further 7 μl FK209 (0.55 M in acetonitrile) and 7 mg PTAA was added to 1 ml of the HTM solution to prevent possible dedope and deposited at 2,000 r.p.m. For the thermal stability test, 15 mg PTAA with the addition of 7.5 μl Li-TFSI/acetonitrile (180 mg ml −1 ) and 10 μl 4-tert-butylpyridine was deposited by spin-coating at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. Basic material characterization The morphology of perovskite films was measured using a cold field-emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-4800). The XRD patterns were collected using a PANalytical X’Pert Pro X-ray powder diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation ( λ  = 1.54050 Å). PL was measured by a FLS980 fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd.) with an excitation at 450–470 nm. Time-resolved PL was measured by the FLS980 fluorescence spectrometer with excitation wavelength at 470 nm. The UV–vis absorption spectra were obtained using an UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectrophotometer (Hitachi UH4150). In situ UV–vis absorption spectra were tested by reacting the as-prepared PbI 2
films and organic cation solutions in a Quartz Flow-Through Semi-Micro Cuvette with a 2-mm slit. XPS measurements were carried out on an XPS AXIS Ultra DLD (Kratos Analytical). The current density–voltage characteristics of the perovskite devices were obtained using a Keithley 2420 Source Measure Unit under AM 1.5 G illumination at 1,000 W m −2
with a Newport Thermal Oriel 91192 solar simulator. The shading mask and one of our best devices were sent to the NIM for certification. The active area was defined as 0.0831 cm 2 . EQEs were measured by an Enlitech EQE measurement system. PL mapping was measured by a laser scanning confocal microscope (Enlitech, SPCM-1000) equipped with a 470-nm pulse laser and galvo-based scanner in air, in which the signal of area 1,225 (35 × 35) μm 2
was collected. Thermal gravimetric analysis was obtained from a SDT Q600 thermogravimetric analyser (TA Instruments) with a ramping at 30 °C min −1
from 20 °C to 180 °C. For sample preparation, 100 μl of different organic cation solutions was spin-coated onto the as-prepared PbI 2
films for 10 s at 20 °C. Then the whole films were scraped from the substrate and transferred to the measurement furnaces immediately. FTIR was measured by a Spectrum Spotlight 200 FTIR microscope. Time-of-flight SIMS measurement was performed using a PHI nanoTOF II instrument (ULVAC-PHI, Inc.). A 30-keV Bi +
pulsed primary ion beam was used for the analysis. TEM and the electron diffraction test were taken in an aberration-corrected JEOL JEM-ARM300F microscope at 300 KV. The precursor used for preparing the TEM sample was one-fifth of the concentration used for devices, which is suitable for TEM measurement. The structure optimization and electrostatic potential of HFB–FAI was estimated by the DFT calculation using the Gaussian 16 software package 33 . To carefully consider the weak intermolecular interaction of the complex, the DFT calculations were carried out with the DFT functional ωB9X-D (ref.  34 ) and basis set Def2TZVP. The electrostatic surface potential of the complex was generated with GaussView software. Films for the phase stability test were aged in a box with a humidifier. The operational stability was tested under an AM 1.5 G solar system (WAVELABS SINUS-70), in which the devices were loaded into an electrochemical workstation (CHI1000C, CH Instruments) and the loading voltage was fixed at MPP manually. During the operational stability test, the device temperature is measured to be 50 ± 5 °C. QCM-D monitoring QCM-D measurements were performed in the QSense Analyzer (Biolin Scientific). PbI 2
was deposited on quartz sensors coated with silicon dioxide using the same method as the devices. FAI/IPA or FAI/HFB + IPA solutions were pumped into a chamber continuously and reacted with PbI 2 . Changes in the frequency of the third, fifth, seventh and ninth overtones ( n  = 3, 5, 7, 9) are used to fit mass change in the Kelvin–Voigt model. ICP-AES test The inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) test was taken in the Prodigy7 ICP-OES (Teledyne Leeman Labs). In our experiment, PbI 2
films were coated on a glass slide by doctor blade coating, which was placed vertically and reacted with 70 ml FAI/IPA or FAI/HFB + IPA solutions (2 mg ml −1
for FAI) in a glass container. The container vial was sealed to prevent evaporation of the solvent so that the mass of FAI could not be overestimated owing to solvent evaporation. After a certain reaction time as reported in the manuscript (15 s, 30 s, 60 s, 120 s, 1,200 s, 3,600 s), the glass slide with PbI 2
film was removed immediately from the reaction container and the FAI solution was stirred evenly. Then the solution was extracted and diluted (1:39 v/v) in water before sending to test. An extra 50 mg ml −1
of sodium hypophosphite was added to prevent oxidation and evaporation of iodine.

of FAI (0.2 mg ml −1 ) in IPA at 293 K is +0.245 V, which dropped to +0.197 V of FAI with the addition of HFB

\(({{\rm{\gamma }}}_{{I}^{-}})\)
and with
\(({{\rm{\gamma }}}_{{I}^{-}-{\rm{HFB}}})\)
HFB could be compared using the Nernst equation
\({{\rm{E}}}_{{I}^{-}}-{{\rm{E}}}_{{I}^{-}-{\rm{HFB}}}=RT{\rm{ln}}({{\rm{\gamma }}}_{{I}^{-}}/{{\rm{\gamma }}}_{{I}^{-}-{\rm{HFB}}})/F\) . The
\({{\rm{\gamma }}}_{{I}^{-}}/{{\rm{\gamma }}}_{{I}^{-}-{\rm{HFB}}}\)
ratio is determined to be 2.2, indicating the substantially reduced activity of iodide ions. The decrease in the ion activity ultimately leads to a decrease in the chemical potential of FAI, which retards the reaction between FAI and PbI 2 . Extended Data Fig. 2 DFT calculations for the FAI ⋯ HFB ⋯ PbI 2
three-component system. DFT-calculated Gibbs energy of three reactions in gas phase ( a ) and the implicit solvent model (solvent = DMF) ( b ). According to the implicit solvent model, we observed that the Gibbs energy of reaction 1 (−3.19 kcal mol −1 ) is still lower than that of reaction 2 (6.00 kcal mol −1 ) in solvent. Notably, reaction 3 (Δ G  = −3.97 kcal mol −1 ) became more favourable in solvent, which is consistent with the UV–vis absorption spectra of the three-component system (Fig.
1d ). This was probably because of the coordination of solvent molecules in the implicit solvent model. But the energy of reaction 3 in solvent is still not enough to cancel out the energy difference between reaction 1 and reaction 2. Therefore, DFT calculations in gas phase as well as in the implicit solvent model (solvent = DMF) yield consistent results, that HFB reacts with FAI to form [FAI ⋯ HFB] and retards the reaction between FAI and PbI 2 . Extended Data Fig. 3 Anion–π interaction between the AX component of perovskite and HFB. UV–vis absorption spectra for HFB, various salts with different cations and anions FAI ( a ), MAI ( b ), CsI ( c ), MACl ( d ), MABr ( e ), MASCN ( f ) and their mixture. Similar redshift about the absorption edge from 280 nm to more than 320 nm was found after FAI, MAI or CsI solution mixing with HFB, indicating that this polarization appeared regardless of the cation species 35 . Besides, the absorption edge of HFB at 280 nm shifted to 285 nm and 300 nm after mixing with Br −
and SCN − , respectively. These evidences implied that such polarization also existed between HFB and bromide or even SCN − . It should be noted that there is no redshift observed when HFB is mixed with chloride, indicative of no polarization, which is probably because of the small radius of chlorine. However, because anion–π interactions also consisted of the contribution from electrostatic force, the strong electrostatic force between Cl −
and HFB also leads to anion–π interactions, as reported previously 36 . These results indicate that the anion–π interaction is widely present between HFB and various types of AX in perovskite.

Abstract
Carrier extraction in mixed tin–lead perovskite solar cells is improved by modifying the top and bottom perovskite surfaces with ethylenediammonium diiodide and glycine hydrochloride, respectively. Trap densities in perovskite layers are reduced as a result of surface passivation effects and an increase in film crystallinity. In addition, the oriented aggregation of the ethylenediammonium and glycinium cations at the charge collection interfaces results in the formation of surface dipoles, which facilitate charge extraction. As a result, the treated mixed tin–lead perovskite solar cells showed improved performance, with a fill factor of 0.82 and a power conversion efficiency of up to 23.6%. The unencapsulated device also shows improved stability under AM1.5 G, retaining over 80% of the initial efficiency after 200 h continuous operation in an inert atmosphere. Our strategy is also successfully applied to centimeter-scale devices, with efficiencies of up to 21.0%.

Abstract Inverted perovskite solar cells still suffer from significant non-radiative recombination losses at the perovskite surface and across the perovskite/C 60
interface, limiting the future development of perovskite-based single- and multi-junction photovoltaics. Therefore, more effective inter- or transport layers are urgently required. To tackle these recombination losses, we introduce ortho-carborane as an interlayer material that has a spherical molecular structure and a three-dimensional aromaticity. Based on a variety of experimental techniques, we show that ortho-carborane decorated with phenylamino groups effectively passivates the perovskite surface and essentially eliminates the non-radiative recombination loss across the perovskite/C 60
interface with high thermal stability. We further demonstrate the potential of carborane as an electron transport material, facilitating electron extraction while blocking holes from the interface. The resulting inverted perovskite solar cells deliver a power conversion efficiency of over 23% with a low non-radiative voltage loss of 110 mV, and retain >97% of the initial efficiency after 400 h of maximum power point tracking. Overall, the designed carborane based interlayer simultaneously enables passivation, electron-transport and hole-blocking and paves the way toward more efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.

Introduction Perovskite-based tandem solar cells are almost exclusively based on inverted ( pin -type) perovskite cells due to their thin charge transport layers (nm to tens of nm) and absence of high-temperature treatments during fabrication (below 100 °C) 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 . Thus, improving the performance of these
pin -type devices is an important task as this is where perovskites will likely enter the market for renewable energy generation. For record-level
pin -type cells it has been shown that the voltage loss is governed by the top electron transport layer (e.g., C 60
or PCBM), and this is quite irrespective of the involved perovskite composition (Fig.  1a ). However, the non-radiative recombination at the perovskite/C 60
interface and the involved defect states remain fundamentally poorly understood 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 . Recent results in this regard have shown that recombination occurs predominantly across the interface 12 , likely due to a small energy level offset between the conduction band minimum of the perovskite and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of C 60 13 , or charge transfer states at the interface 12 , 14 . Thus, it is critical to improve the energy alignment, passivate defects on the perovskite surface or repel minority carriers from the interface. However, to our knowledge, up to now, no study has been able to entirely suppress the interfacial recombination in the presence of the C 60
layer. Fig. 1: Universal photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) losses induced by C 60 , device structure and energy level diagram. a

Full size image Notwithstanding this point, there have been many attempts to reduce recombination at the perovskite surface and across the perovskite/transport layer interfaces. Noteworthy for
nip- structured perovskite solar cells (PSCs), Sutuanto et al. 15
showed that the implementation of a two-dimensional (2D) layer (~50 nm thick) on the perovskite surface essentially eliminates the interfacial recombination by preventing minority carriers from reaching the interface between Spiro-OMeTAD and the perovskite. This is due to the nearly lossless interface between the 3D and 2D perovskites and the appreciable thickness of the 2D perovskite layer, which physically separates electrons and holes, thus reducing interface recombination. Indeed, the use of 2D/3D perovskites at the top interface in
nip
cells is very prevalent and enabled high open-circuit voltages ( V OC s) 16 , 17 , 18 . It, therefore, follows that a similar hole-blocking layer for
pin
cells should lead to reduced voltage losses, however, given the opposite charge polarity, the implementation of these 2D/3D layers in
pin -type cells has been challenging. Nevertheless, the formation of 2D wide gap perovskites was recently demonstrated in several publications via phenethylammonium (PEA)-based molecules which improved the
V OC
of
pin -type perovskite cells 19 , 20 , 21 . A similar surface modification strategy is based on sulfate (SO 4 2− ) and phosphate (PO 4 3− ) dissolved in isopropanol or toluene 22 , 23 . Employed as a surface treatment, these molecules form a thin lead oxysalt layer (PbSO 4
and Pb 3 (PO 4 ) 2 ) on the perovskite surface, which can stabilize under-coordinated bonds on the perovskite surface and improve the stability (T 80
lifetimes of over 1000 h at 65 °C were reported) 22 . Despite this success, the long-term stability of 2D layers remains a concern, for example, due to the possible interdiffusion and mixing of the 2D/3D perovskite layers as discussed in a previous work 24 . Alternatively, some insulating layers were used to reduce the interfacial recombination without the concern of interdiffusion. For example, commercially available insulating polymers (such as PMMA and PS) have been utilized as interlayers between the perovskite and C 60
for
pin -type and for
nip -type PSCs 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 . Moreover, the inorganic insulator LiF has been found effective at reducing the non-radiative recombination loss at the interface for various perovskite systems via the formation of a surface dipole that facilitates the extraction of electrons 9 , 29 . However, it should be noted that LiF/C 60
still reduces the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the neat layer by a factor of ~10 in the case of triple-cation perovskites, and again there are concerns regarding the long-term stability 29 , 30 . Generally, the application of insulating layers leads to the formation of a tunneling contact. However, the application of intrinsically insulating layers limits the ability to block minority charges without compromising the charge transport and thus fill factor (FF) performance. In addition, insulating layers may also cause a loss of the
V OC
as their low conductivity can lead to a gradient in the quasi-Fermi level of majority charges, resulting in a mismatch between internal and external
V OC
(“quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS)- V OC ” mismatch) 30 , 31 , 32 . This is, for example, observed when increasing the thickness of a PMMA interlayer (Supplementary Figs.  1
and
2 ). Thus, an effective and highly selective electron transport layer requires good hole-blocking properties and good electron transport capacities to simultaneously increase the FF and
V OC . In this regard, carboranes are an interesting class of spherical molecules with three-dimensional aromaticity, which are potential electron-transporting materials but have not yet been explored in the field of PSCs. These molecules are composed of carbon, boron, and hydrogen and often form polyhedrons. Polyhedral and spherical molecules with delocalized π-orbitals are ideal for thin film organic transport layers due to their omnidirectional charge transport. They are also tunable as one can functionalize these molecules with various functional groups to tune the electronic structure and other properties of interest 33 , 34 . Furthermore, they have previously been used in light-emitting diodes 35 , 36
and as building block of hole-transporting materials in PSCs to improve the charge transfer rate 37 . Herein, we introduced
ortho -carborane (CB, C 2 B 10 H 12 ) as an interfacial layer in low-gap triple-cation
pin -based PSCs to assist electron extraction and reduce across interface non-radiative recombination. We demonstrate the electron transport potential of functionalized caboranes. We additionally investigated CB functionalized by phenylamino groups (CB-NH 2 ), which are Lewis bases that are reported to passivate perovskite surface defects. Besides, carborane exhibits a large ionization potential thus, it is effective at blocking holes when employed as a selective transport layer. It is also hydrophobic, which effectively improves the water resistance of the perovskite device. Using CB-NH 2
as an interlayer we achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 23% with low non-radiative voltage losses of 110 mV, in
pin
single junctions, and the PCE retains over 97% of its initial value after 400 h operation under maximum power point (MPP) conditions at 1-sun illumination and room temperature. A variety of experimental investigations indicate that CB-NH 2
can overcome the long-standing C 60 -induced interfacial recombination in inverted PSCs. Results Molecular synthesis and energy levels of carborane O -carborane is commercially available, however, due to its low molecular weight in combination with weak intermolecular forces it has a low sublimation temperature under reduced pressure. This limits its use as an ETL because the thin films can evaporate under high vacuum during the completion of the device (e.g., evaporation of metal electrodes). We therefore chose to synthesize a derivative of
o- carborane to increase its molecular weight and further modify its electronic/passivation properties. We target a phenylamine functionalized
o -carborane (structure Fig.  1b , CB-NH 2
henceforth) to raise the LUMO by increased conjugation, and reduce electronic traps from previously mentioned DOS broadening via the Lewis base lone pairs on the primary amines 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 . The direct addition of functional groups on the carbon sites of
o -carborane is very challenging. We, therefore, started the molecular synthesis (Supplementary Fig.  3 ) from dodecahydro-arachno-bis(acatonitrile)decaborane which is available commercially. An electrophilic addition reaction with diphenylacetylene was employed to yield phenyl functionalized CB (in short CB-ph). The amino functionalization of the phenylene group was achieved by an initial nitrification and subsequent reduction reaction to yield CB-NH 2 . The detailed synthesis, a description of the CB-NH 2
molecule and additional molecular structure characterizations (such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectra) can be found in the Supplementary Note  1 , and Supplementary Figs.  4 – 7 . To estimate the energy levels of highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO/LUMO), we employed cyclic voltammetry (CV) to measure the reduction potential (LUMO energy levels, Supplementary Fig.  8 ). Then optical energy gaps ( E G ) were calculated by the intersection of normalized absorption and emission spectra (Supplementary Fig.  9 ), and with Tauc plots of the absorption spectra (Supplementary Fig.  10 ) 42 , 43 . Finally, the HOMO energy levels were obtained by subtracting the LUMO energy level from the
E G
(Supplementary Table  1 ). As shown in Fig.  1c , the CB-NH 2
has different energetics from CB. As predicted, the functionalized phenylamine groups in conjugation with the carborane core significantly raise the HOMO/ LUMO levels. Further in Fig.  1c , we compare the measured energetics with those of FAPbI 3
and C 60
where we observe the much deeper HOMO of the carboranes than C 60 . This should improve its hole-blocking ability as predicted. The energy levels of the perovskite and the electron and hole transport layers (details below) were obtained from photoemission yield spectroscopy and referred from literature 30 . Electron transport properties of CB-NH 2
To evaluate the electron-transporting potential of carborane, we measured electron mobility of CB-NH 2
via the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method and compared it with C 60 . We used the following configuration for the electron-only device ITO/ZnO/CB-NH 2
(100 nm) or C 60
(200 nm)/BCP/Ag, which precluded the ability to also assess the electron mobility of CB due to the previously mentioned volatility. As shown in Fig.  1d , the CB-NH 2
device exhibits textbook-like SCLC behavior with a clear slope variation from 0–3 V. Using the Mott-Gurney equation of
J  = 9 ε r ε 0 μ ( V app – V bi ) 2 /8 L 3 , where
V app
the applied field and
V bi
the built-in voltage,
ε 0
is the vacuum permittivity (8.85 × 10 − 12  F m −1 ),
ε r
(3.5) is the dielectric constant, and
L
is the device thickness, the voltage-dependent mobility can be extracted in the SCLC region. As plotted in the inset picture in Fig.  1d , both the CB-NH 2
and C 60
device reveals the SCLC region (>1 V). This allows us to extract a mobility of 7.3 × 10 −4  cm 2 V −1  s −1
for CB-NH 2 , which is one order of magnitude lower than that of C 60
(6.7 × 10 −3  cm 2 V −1 s −1 ). When compared to other non-fullerene organic transport materials from the literature, the mobility of CB-NH 2
is middling 44 , 45 . Nevertheless, when compared to commonly applied interlayer materials such as the widely used Lewis bases (PEAI) and the polymers PS, PMMA, which are basically insulating materials, the electron-transporting capability of CB-NH 2
is comparatively high. Solar cell fabrication and photovoltaic performance We then applied CB and CB-NH 2
as hole-blocking layers in
pin -structured triple-cation PSCs using Cs 0.05 (MA 0.05 FA 0.95 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.95 Br 0.05 ) 3
with an optical bandgap of 1.56 eV as shown from the derivative of the external quantum efficiency (EQE) in the Supplementary Fig.  11 . The full device structure was ITO/MeO-2PACz/perovskite/carborane interlayer/C 60 /BCP/Ag. The CB-based interlayers were implemented by spin coating a diluted solution (1 mg/mL in chlorobenzene) on top of the perovskite. Further methods are presented in the Methods. Figure  2a–c
show the PV parameter distribution of the control, CB and CB-NH 2 - treated solar cells (over 14 cells for each type). The best control cell delivered a PCE of 21.5%, with a
V OC
of 1.128 V, a
J SC
of 23.52 mA cm −2 , and an FF of 81.15%. This provides us with a good starting point for further interfacial improvements and pursuing record-level efficiency. When introducing the CB as an interlayer, we find that the
V OC
remains unchanged, while there is a statistical improvement in fill factor (FF) and short-circuit current ( J SC ). The best CB-based devices exhibit a slightly lower
V OC
of 1.120 V, with a
J SC
of 23.77 mA cm −2 , and an FF of 81.68%, which represents only a small improvement compared to the control device. Any improvement is surprising given the volatile nature of the CB molecule, therefore we speculate there remains a small amount on the surface.

has a far more profound effect on the device parameters. The
JV
curves of the best-performing cells with and without CB-NH 2
are shown Fig.  2d . The champion CB-NH 2
treated cell exhibit a PCE of 23.05%, with a high voltage of 1.170 V for the given bandgap of the absorber (1.56 eV) and a small hysteresis at a scan speed of 20 mV/s as shown in Supplementary Fig.  12 . Based on the EQE spectrum (Supplementary Fig.  13 ), we calculated the radiative recombination current in the dark ( J 0,rad ), which corresponds to a radiative
V OC
limit of 1.28 eV. Therefore, the non-radiative voltage losses are approximately 110 mV. This is among the smallest
V OC
deficits for
pin -structured cells, with only few reports that achieved even smaller voltage losses 23 , 46 , 47 . We also measured the steady-state power output (SPO) of the devices at their MPP voltage for 600 s. As shown in Fig.  2e , the stabilized current density of CB-NH 2
treated and control devices are 23.73, 23.26 mA/cm 2
at a bias of 0.97 and 0.91 V, respectively, confirming a stabilized PCE of 23.04% and 21.10%, which are consistent with
JV
results. We note that there was a PCE drop in the initial 10 s for both devices, which is likely due to current losses related to ion movement in the perovskite absober 48 , 49 . We also note that the integrated current density from the EQE spectrum matches well with the
JV
results (Fig.  2f ). Passivation and device operational stabilities Highly motivated by the excellent performance improvements rendered by the CB-NH 2
interlayer, we proceeded to quantify the device- and passivation stability. We first confirmed that the CB-NH 2
molecules do not change the absorption spectrum of the perovskite layer therefore unlikely to alter the perovskite bulk properties (Supplementary Fig.  14 ). We then performed water contact angle measurements to evaluate the influence of CB-NH 2
on the surface properties of perovskite. A larger water contact angle of 75° was determined for the CB-NH 2
coated perovskite film, in comparison to the 41° of the bare perovskite (Fig.  3a ). The hydrophobicity of the carborane is beneficial for protecting perovskite from the ingress of moisture. Thermal stability is another concern for various interfacial passivation materials. We note that carboranes are regarded as thermally stable molecules that have been used as a building block for high-temperature-resistant materials 50 . A previous study has proven that the passivation effect of PEAI, one of the most popular passivation materials, deteriorates at elevated temperatures, causing decreased
V OC
in devices as a result of the formation of the 2D phase 51 . Similarly, LiF has also been suggested to negatively influence device stability 29 . We, therefore, compared CB-NH 2
with these two widely used materials at elevated temperatures (50 °C to 100 °C), and measured the PLQY variation to assess the “passivation stability”. As shown in Fig.  3b , the CB-NH 2
coated perovskite sample shows the highest initial PLQY value, indicating an effective passivation of defects. At higher temperatures, the PLQY values of all samples decreases, e.g., the PEAI sample retains only 27% of its initial value, and this value for LiF sample is 41.2%. For comparison, the CB-NH 2
coated film demonstrates a smaller decline, retaining 74% of its initial PLQY. Moreover, we noticed that after cooling down to room temperature, the PLQY of PEAI and LiF samples remained at a similar value as at 100 °C, indicating an irreversible process, while the CB-NH 2
sample almost returned to its initial value. We noted that no new diffraction peak was detected in the CB-NH 2
sample after annealing, indicating neither the molecule nor any degradation product entered the perovskite and no 2D phase was formed (Supplementary Fig.  15 ). To quantify the stability, we performed MPP tracking on the devices in a glovebox using a white-light-emitting diode (LED) without UV at 26 °C. The devices comprising CB-NH 2
maintained over 97% of the initial PCE (Fig.  3c ) under MPP and 1-sun equivalent illumination for 400 h, indicating superb operational stability. In contrast, the control sample retains 89% of its initial efficiency over the same time. The improved operational stability is attributed to effective passivation, which reduces the surface reactivity and retards the degradation rate. We further confirm the improved operational stability during maximum power point tracking under 1-sun equivalent illumination with a white LED in air (30% RH) and at a temperature of 40 °C. As shown in Supplementary Fig.  16 , the CB-NH 2
devices also demonstrate better stability under these conditions, thus the improvement might be related to the increased hydrophobicity and resistance to moisture. Fig. 3: Stability evaluation. a

treated samples, the contact angle with water is larger.

interfacial recombination To understand the simultaneous improvement of the FF and the
V OC
in case of CB-NH 2 , we first employed PLQY measurements to analyze the non-radiative recombination in perovskite films, multilayer partial cell stacks, and complete PSCs. Given that it is a non-contact technique, PLQY characterization allows one to decouple the contribution of every layer/interface to the non-radiative recombination loss. We measured different partial cell stacks and compared the results with complete devices to enable insights into the working mechanism of CB-NH 2 . We use a laser of 520 nm wavelength with a spot size of near 0.5 cm 2
to illuminate the samples with a 1-sun equivalent intensity by adjusting the produced current close to the
J SC
under a standard solar simulator. As shown in Fig.  4a
and Supplementary Fig.  17 , the PLQY of the bare perovskite on glass is improved from 2.3% to 5.2% due to the CB-NH 2
treatment, indicative of surface trap passivation. To correlate the PLQY results with the kinetic properties of photogenerated charges, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) characterization was performed. As shown in Supplementary Fig.  18 , a neat perovskite film without charge transport layers exhibit approximately a mono-exponential decay. In this case, then a Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination-dominated lifetime ( τ SRH ) can be deduced to be 1800 and 1000 ns for CB-NH 2
treated and control films, respectively. The extended
τ SRH
of CB-NH 2
coated perovskite films is favorable for carrier collection. When capped with C 60 , the PLQY of the control sample was reduced from 2.3% to 0.67% by a factor of ~4. In contrast, the C 60
induced PL quenching was substantially reduced for the CB-NH 2
treated perovskite/C 60
stacks (from 5.2% to 2.1%). The PLQY of perovskite/CB-NH 2 /C 60
stack is nearly identical to the bare perovskite sample (2.3%), indicating that we overcame the critical C 60 -induced non-radiative recombination upon introducing the CB-NH 2
interlayer for this system. To our knowledge, this is the first time that this was achieved for
pin -type perovskite cells based on a C 60
ETL. As a result, we obtained a very high PLQY of 1.45% in full device, which is rarely achieved in
pin -type cells, demonstrating the unique passivation effect of carborane interlayer. Fig. 4: Photoluminescence quantum yield measurements (PLQY) and internal quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) diagram. a

Voltage loss mechanism for the control and CB-NH 2 -based samples. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Full size image To quantify the open-circuit voltage potential for every individual stack, we calculated the internal electron-hole quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) from PLQY results by using the equation QFLS =  k B T *ln(PLQY ×  J G / J 0,rad ), where
J G
is the generated current density at 1-sun and
J 0,rad
is the radiative recombination current in the dark as shown in Supplementary Fig.  13 . As shown in Fig.  4a , the neat perovskite exhibits an implied
V OC
of 1.183 V. This value increases to 1.204 V after the introduction of CB-NH 2 , which is attributed to the passivation effect on the perovskite surface. The perovskite/C 60
half stack exhibits a lower QFLS of 1.150 V, while the CB-NH 2
treated perovskite/C 60
sample shows QFLS of 1.180 V, which is nearly equal to the neat perovskite, indicating that the C 60 -induced interfacial recombination is effectively overcome. The PLQY and QFLS values mentioned above are collected in Table  1 . Moreover, the difference between the QFLS and
V OC
of the cells is negligible in both samples (w/ and wo/CB-NH 2 ). This demonstrates spatially flat Fermi levels throughout the device and well-aligned energy levels for majority carriers. Note any misalignment (downhill energy offset for electrons and uphill offset for holes) in combination with a finite interface recombination velocity would readily cause a gradient in the electron/hole quasi-Fermi levels and a QFLS- V OC
mismatch. Figure  4b
depicts the voltage loss mechanism in the control and CB-NH 2 -based devices. Under the limitation of thermodynamic radiative which is 1.28 eV for the given bandgap, the perovskite loss and interface loss dominate the voltage loss in both samples whereas the transport loss is negligible (see the identical QFLS and
V OC
of the full device). After the introduction of CB-NH 2 , the simultaneously suppressed perovskite loss and interface loss result in the improved
V OC . Table 1 PLQY and QFLS results of perovskite film, perovskite/C 60
half stack, and full cell with/without CB-NH 2 Full size table In order to gain more insight into the influence of charge recombination dynamics in complete devices, we also performed transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements under a white LED with an equivalent intensity of 1-sun. As shown in Supplementary Fig.  19 , the CB-NH 2
treated device exhibits a long lifetime (4.43 μs) which is nearly twice as much as the blank device (2.26 μs). The improved carrier lifetime is consistent with the PLQY results. We note that this value is larger than the bulk SRH lifetime obtained from TRPL, which is likely related to capacitive effects impacting TPV 52 , 53 . In addition, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed to characterize the charge carrier recombination near open-circuit conditions (≈1 V), the series resistance ( R s ), and recombination resistance ( R rec ) of the CB-NH 2
and the reference device. All of these parameters can be obtained from the Nyquist plots intuitively. The equivalent circuits are presented in Supplementary Fig.  20 . The semicircle of the CB-NH 2 -based devices is larger than that of the blank device, indicating a significant reduction in charge carrier recombination rate, attributed to the lower
R s
and higher
R rec . We also estimated the apparent trap density ( n trap ) of the perovskite films by measuring the dark
JV
profiles of the electron-only devices. As shown and discussed in Supplementary Fig.  21 , the current in the ohmic region is smaller for the CB-NH 2 -based device, which could be correlated with a lower overall trap density and the improved
V OC 54 . However, the measurable trap density from this experiment is limited by the electrode charge per unit cell volume, which is typically very similar to the apparent trap density in thin film (~500 nm) devices as recently shown in refs.
55 ,
56 . We then aimed towards an understanding of the impact of our carborane passivation on the ideality factor ( n ID ), fill factor losses, and efficiency potential and therefore investigated the intensity (or voltage) dependence of the non-radiative recombination losses. To this end, we employed three techniques: intensity-dependent quasi-Fermi level splitting, intensity-dependent
V OC , and injection-dependent electroluminescence (EL). We first measured the intensity-dependent PLQY (iPLQY) of the different stack of samples. Upon converting the PLQY at different laser intensities to the QLFS, we obtain the QFLS as a function of light intensity (Fig.  5a ). Furthermore, we construct a pseudo-dark
JV
curve by plotting the recombination current minus the voltage-independent generation current under AM1.5 G (  J SC ) on the y-axis and the QFLS as
x
axis. As a result, we create a pseudo-light
JV
curves which allow us to quantify the implied
JV
performance of the film including the FF potential in the absence of
R s . As shown in Fig.  5a , CB-NH 2 -based samples demonstrates a holistically higher QFLS value in the complete device, half stack, and bare perovskite. The pseudo- JV
curves are shown in Fig.  5b
with photovoltaic parameters collected in Table  2 . With regard to the ideality factors, in Fig.  5a
for the control cell we obtain an
n ID
of 1.55 while it is 1.43 for the CB-NH 2
treated cell. We note that the difference between the pFF on the cells from the pseudo
JV s reflects the different FF of the devices. Thus, the improved FF of the CB-NH 2 -based device is largely due to a lower ideality factor rather than improved charge transport. We also measured the iPLQY and corresponding QFLS on perovskite and perovskite/C 60
stack with and without C 60
(Fig.  5c, d ). The pseudo
JV s are plotted in Supplementary Fig.  22
and the parameters are shown in Table  2 . The implied FF lost from the neat perovskite to perovskite/C 60
half stack is 1.5% in the control films, while this decline of FF is reduced to 0.4% for the CB-NH 2
coated samples. This demonstrates the introduction of CB-NH 2
compensates for the compromised FF caused by the deposition of C 60
due to dark recombination. For the perovskite and perovskite/C 60
half stacks, we noticed an increase in
n ID
by 0.15 from the neat perovskite (1.33) to the perovskite/C 60
film (1.48), whereas for the CB-NH 2
treated sample displays an
n ID
of 1.43 (Fig.  5c, d ). This is again consistent with reduced non-radiative recombination between the C 60
and the perovskite. Fig. 5: Pseudo- JV

24 . Both measurements, further confirm the higher pseudo FF, demonstrating the improved FF due to suppressed non-radiative recombination. Electron extraction and hole blocking To reveal the working mechanism of the CB-NH 2
layer, we quantified the charge selectivity at the perovskite/C 60
interface. To this end, we carried out conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) on ITO/MeO-2PACz/Pero/(CB-NH 2 )/C 60
films with and without CB-NH 2
interlayer. This method has been used by Xu and Caprioglio et al. previsouly 57 , 58 . In addition, the samples were illuminated with a 5 mW/cm 2
white LED to generate electron-hole pairs. To demonstrate the different transport behavior between electrons and holes, we applied a step-by step voltage variation from positive to negative bias to the tip to imitate the process of electron and hole extraction. Electron extraction is imitated when we apply a positive voltage to the tip while hole extraction is imitated when we apply a negative voltage. Figure  6
demonstrates that the CB-NH 2
treated samples exhibits a higher current in the positive bias region, whereas the current is lower at a negative bias with respect to the control sample. To be specific, when 1 V bias is applied to the tip, CB-NH 2
treated samples approach an average current of −0.72 nA, while the control sample exhibits a lower average current (−0.2 nA). In contrast, CB-NH 2
treated samples exhibit a lower current when −1 V is applied to the tip (0.02 nA) compared to the control sample (0.07 nA). The averaged values were obtained from area-averaged profiles. We note that the isolated spikes could be related to the carrier diffusion pathway or the morphology. Moreover, all samples have relatively lower current value in the negative region than in the positive region, which is consistent with the electron-selective transport through the C 60
layer. Overall, C-AFM clearly demonstrates that the CB-NH 2
layer increases electron extraction while decreasing hole extraction. The improved electron extraction is also consistent with the improved FF and decreased trap density observed with PL. Note, due to the low light intensity (5 mW/cm 2 ) the measurement is in essence a dark
JV
measurement, and the low values of the current are limited by the small radius of the tip of 35 nm. Therefore, the current signal measured from C-AFM is not comparable to the
J SC
from
JV
curves. Fig. 6: Improved electron extraction and hole blocking at perovskite/C 60
interface. 3D conductive-AFM images (5 × 5 μm) of the samples with a structure of ITO/MeO-2PACz/Pero/CB-NH 2 / C 60
(CB-NH 2
treated) and ITO/MeO-2PACz/Pero/ C 60
(control). The images represent a step-by-step applied voltage variation from −1.0 V applied to the tip (left) for hole extraction to 1.0 V applied to the tip (right) for electron extraction. Full size image Contribution from carborane and amino moiety to device performance In order to investigate the contribution from the carborane and amino group moiety in CB-NH 2
to the improvement of device performance, we also studied the intermediate phenyl functionalized carborane (CB-ph) without the amino group because the bare carborane suffers from sublimation on the perovskite layer. As can been seen in Supplementary Fig.  25 , CB-ph leads to a significant FF improvement (~2%) but only slight
V OC
improvement (~10 mV). This indicates that the carborane alone reduces non-radiative recombination less effectively than CB-NH 2
but has a significant effect on the electron extraction which is consistent with the C-AFM result. The slight
V OC
improvement can be further confirmed by the improved PLQY of the ITO/perovskite/C 60
stack with the CB-ph interlayer but identical PLQY of the ITO/perovskite with and without the CB-ph interlayer (Supplementary Fig.  26 ). These results suggest that there is a small contribution (~10 mV) of the carborane moiety to the total
V OC
gain of the CB-NH 2
functionalized device (~50 mV) which we attribute to the improved hole-blocking ability of the carborane. However, the effect of the amino group is more significant. As for the FF improvement, our results indicate a more significant contribution of the carborane moiety (~2%) to the total gain (~4%), which suggests that the improvement originates partially from the hole-blocking and electron extraction ability of the CB molecule. Nevertheless, considering that the packing and adsorption ability of the CB-ph and the CB-NH 2
molecules are likely different, the exact contribution of the carborane moiety is difficult to quantify. Given that the performance of the CB-NH 2
device is optimum, we can conclude that the carborane and the amino group are working synergistically and are indispensable. Surface passivation and Pb-CB-NH 2
interaction To further explore the passivation mechanism of CB-NH 2 , we examined the intermolecular interactions between CB-NH 2
and perovskite. We conducted Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements to study the interactions between CB-NH 2
and perovskite moieties. We dissolved CB-NH 2
and PbI 2
in DMF solvent and then dried the solution to obtain a mixed powder 40 , 59 . The FTIR spectra of the mixture and pure CB-NH 2
powders, displayed in Supplementary Fig.  27 , reveal that the addition of PbI 2
results in the variation of the
v (N-H) interaction. Given that the lone pairs of N contained functional groups, especially in the amino group, can interact with Pb 2+ , we speculate the shift of the
v (N-H) peak originates from the interaction between the N atom and Pb 2+ . We further performed XPS measurements on perovskite films with/without CB-NH 2
to study the interaction between the interlayer and the perovskite. As shown in Supplementary Fig.  28 , the Pb signals between 136 eV and 146 eV binding energy demonstrate 2 main peaks, which can be ascribed to the excited electrons of the 4 f 7/2
and 4 f 5/2
orbitals. Apparently, the signal of the perovskite film with CB-NH 2
shows a visible shift towards lower binding energies, indicating the interaction between under-coordinated Pb and CB-NH 2 . Since the under-coordinated Pb 2+
on the perovskite surface are typically active sites for interfacial reactions that act as electronic traps 60 , 61 , the interaction between CB-NH 2
and Pb might explain the decreased surface trap density, as well as the improved operational stability. We note that the detected B 1 s signal proves the existence of CB-NH 2 . The observed interaction is likely related to the improvement of PL intensity and lifetime for neat perovskite. To obtain more atomistic information regarding to the interaction between the perovskite and CB-NH 2
density functional theory (DFT) simulations were performed. We choose α-FAPbI 3
perovskite and a (001) PbI 2 -terminated surface as model system in accordance with the studied perovskite. A detailed description of the DFT calculations can be found in Supplementary Note  2 . Figure  7a, b
displays a top view of the perovskite and the perovskite/CB-NH 2
at the lowest energy. Figure  7c , shows a cross-sectional view highlighting that distinct hydrogen bonds are formed between N and H from the CB-NH 2
molecule and I from the perovskite surface with a bond length of 2.68 and 2.64 Å, respectively. Such hydrogen bonds with iodide ions have been shown to reduce the trap states and suppress iodide migration, thus improving device performance and long-term stability 62 , 63 , 64 . Moreover, the simulations reveal a very short bond length of Pb-N in both phenylamino groups at 3.58 and 3.11 Å, respectively, indicating CB-NH 2
passivates the under-coordinated Pb atoms on the perovskite surface. These short bond lengths result in an extraordinarily high adsorption energy of −3.42 eV 64 , 65 , 66 . To further corroborate these findings, we calculated the iodine Frenkel (interstitial/vacancy pair) defect formation energy (DFE) and we find an increased DFE by ~0.2 eV upon the CB-NH 2
incorporation (Supplementary Fig.  29 ), indicating reduced creation and diffusion of iodide defects. Based on the above results, we can draw the conclusion that the synergistic bonding effect from N-H···I and N-Pb realize a strong interaction between the perovskite and CB-NH 2 , which is beneficial for simultaneously passivating surface defects and improving the surface stability.

Full size image Discussion In this work, we demonstrate effective control of non-radiative recombination losses at the perovskite/C 60
interface by implementing a carborane-based interlayer in
pin -type PSCs. This is achieved upon the introduction of a phenylamine functionalized carborane derivative CB-NH 2 , which enables efficient defect passivation and selective electron transport with mobility of 7 × 10 −4  cm 2 /Vs. The inverted PSCs with CB-NH 2
incorporated as an interfacial layer reach high PLQYs of 1.4% and PCEs over 23%, with non-radiative voltage losses as low as 110 mV. By analyzing the PLQY and the QFLS of different partial cell stacks, we demonstrate that the implementation of CB-NH 2
as an interlayer nearly eliminates the C 60 -induced interfacial recombination, which has not yet been achieved with other interfacial modifications. Based on a series of experimental methodologies, we demonstrate that the concomitantly improved
V OC
and FF with CB-NH 2
is a result of the passivation of the perovskite surface, reduced non-radiative recombination across the perovskite/C 60
interface combined with an increased charge carrier selectivity. The CB-NH 2
interlayer also improves the thermal and operational stability of the complete devices, which is attributed to the stabilization of defects on the perovskite surface and the hydrophobic nature of CB-NH 2 . This work addresses one of the most critical issues of inverted PSCs and demonstrates the potential of carborane derivatives as interfacial and electron transport materials in perovskite-based opto-electronic devices. As such, we believe that future molecular design and optimization will pave the way for a particular class electron transport materials based on carboranes. Methods Materials and reagents The raw material dodecahydro-arachno-bis(acatonitrile)decaborane was purchased from Zhengzhou Yuanli Biological Technology Co., Ltd, China, Diphenylacetylene was purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd, China. PbI 2 , PbBr 2 , MABr, MACl, PEAI, BCP, and MeO-2PACz were purchased from TCI. Patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass, FAI, C60, and PCBM were purchased from Advanced Election Technology Co., Ltd. CsI was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. DMSO, DMF, ethanol, chlorobenzene, and isopropanol were purchased from Acros. PSCs fabrication Patterned ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned sequentially for 15 min in suds, deionized water, ethanol, and acetone in ultrasonic bath. Then the substrates were treated with ultraviolet ozone (UV-Ozone) for 30 min and transferred to a nitrogen-filled glove box. All subsequent procedures were done in nitrogen-filled glove boxes. The solutions of MeO-2PACz (1 mmol mL −1
in ethanol) were spin-coated on the ITO substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. The FA-based triple-cation perovskite precursor solution with a formula of Cs 0.05 (MA 0.05 FA 0.95 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.95 Br 0.05 ) 3
was prepared by mixing two 1.5 M FAPbI 3
and MAPbBr 3
perovskite solutions in DMF:DMSO (4:1 volume ratio, v-v), as well as the solution of CsI (1.5 M) and MACl in DMSO (20 mol% MACl were added into the precursor solution for better crystallization). The triple-cation perovskite films were deposited by spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 40 s (5 s for acceleration). 5 s before the end of the procedure chlorobenzene (300 μL) was dispensed onto the still spinning substrate in one continuous flow which lasts for approximately 1 second, following by annealing at 100 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, the carborane molecules were spin-coated from 1 mg/mL solution in chlorobenzene at an rpm of 6000 (3 s for acceleration). Then, the samples were transferred to an evaporation chamber where C 60
(Sigma-Aldrich, 30 nm) at 0.2 Å/s, 8 nm BCP (Sigma-Aldrich) at 0.2 Å/s and 100 nm copper (Sigma-Aldrich) at 0.6 Å/s were deposited under vacuum ( p  = 10 −7  mbar). Characterization and measurements Absolute photoluminescence measurements Excitation for the PL measurements was performed with a 520 nm CW laser (Insaneware) through an optical fiber into an integrating sphere. The intensity of the laser was adjusted to a 1-sun equivalent intensity by illuminating a 1 cm 2
-size PSC under short-circuit and matching the current density to the
J SC
under the sun simulator (22.0 mA/cm 2
at 100 mW cm −2 , or 1.375 × 10 21
photons m −2  s −1 ). A second optical fiber was used from the output of the integrating sphere to an Andor SR393iB spectrometer equipped with a silicon CCD camera (DU420A-BR-DD, iDus). The system was calibrated by using a calibrated halogen lamp with specified spectral irradiance, which was shone into to integrating sphere. A spectral correction factor was established to match the spectral output of the detector to the calibrated spectral irradiance of the lamp. The spectral photon density was obtained from the corrected detector signal (spectral irradiance) by division through the photon energy ( ℎ v ), and the photon numbers of the excitation and emission obtained from numerical integration using MATLAB. Electroluminescence measurements (EL) The absolute EL intensity was measured with a calibrated Si photodetector and a Keithley 485 pico Ampere meter. The detector (with an active area of ~2 cm 2 ) was placed directly in front of the device (0.13 cm 2 ), and the total photon flux was evaluated considering the emission spectrum of perovskite and silicon sub-cell, their relative intensities from the previously measured relative EL spectra and the external quantum efficiency of the detector. A slight underestimation of the EQE EL
(≈1.08×), originating from an additional glass encapsulation, and some photons that escaped to the side and were not detected was compensated. A forward bias was applied to the cell using a Keithley 2400 source meter, and the injected current was monitored. Measurements were conducted with a home-written LabVIEW routine. Typically, the voltage was increased in steps of 20 mV, and the current stabilized for typical 1 s at each step. Intensity-dependent
V
OC
measurements Steady-state intensity-dependent
V OC
(i– V OC ) was measured under mimicked AM1.5 G illumination (Oriel class AAA Xenon lamp-based sun simulator), appropriated neutral density filters, and a Keithley2400. The samples were irradiated by using a 445 nm continuous wave laser (Insaneware). A continuously variable neutral density filter wheel (ThorLabs) was used to attenuate the laser power (up to OD 6). The light intensity was thereby simultaneously measured with a silicon photodetector and a Keithley 485 to improve the accuracy of the measurement. For each intensity, the
V OC
is measured for ~2 s before the
J SC
is measured for the same time. The filter wheel is then moved to the next position and the routine is repeated. A homemade lab view program controlled the variable neutral density filter wheel and measured the
V OC
using a Keithley2400. Current density-voltage characteristics JV -curves were obtained in a 2-wire source-sense configuration with a Keithley 2400. An Oriel class AAA Xenon lamp-based sun simulator was used for illumination providing approximately 100 mW cm −2
of simulated AM1.5 G irradiation and the intensity was monitored simultaneously with a Si photodiode. The exact illumination intensity was used for efficiency calculations, and the simulator was calibrated with a KG5-filtered silicon solar cell (certified by Fraunhofer ISE). The temperature of the cell was fixed to 25 °C and a voltage ramp of 20 mV/s was used. The active area of tested cells was 12 mm 2
as defined from the area of overlap of the electrodes. To measure the
JV -characteristics an illumination mask with an area of 9 mm 2
was used. The spectral mismatch factor ( S M ) was calculated to be 0.982 for the optimized devices with EQE spectra presented in Fig.  2f , however, the obtained current has not been upscaled by 1/ S M . Conductive atomic force Conductive Atomic Force Microscopy was performed with a Solver NT-MDT instrument with a hardware linearized 100 mm scanner and scanning tip. The measurements were performed in contact mode by measuring both spreading resistance and topography. The tip used was a platinum NSG10/Pt. Other Measurements The
1 H NMR spectra were recorded with the Bruker AM 400 spectrometer. The cyclic voltammograms were measured by using a CHI660E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua Co. Ltd, Shanghai, China) in a three-electrode cell. X-ray diffraction measurements were obtained by a Rigaku Ultima IV (Cu Ka radiation,
λ  = 1.5406 Å) in the range of 5°–90° (2θ). The time-resolved photoluminescence decay lifetimes were determined with the single photon counting technique by Edinburgh FLS1000 spectrometer. Transient photovoltage test was conducted under a white-light (LED) which was adjusted to produce the
V OC
at 1-sun conditions (1-sun equivalent), and the laser pulses (532 nm, 2 Hz) to measure the decay of transient photovoltage signals. EQE measurements were measured by Newport-74125 system (Newport Instruments). The operational stability of the unencapsulated PSCs was performed at the MPP tracking under continuous white-light LED array illumination in N 2
atmosphere, the light intensity was calibrated to achieve the same
J SC
from the PSCs measured under a standard solar simulator (AM1.5 G, 100 mW cm −2 ). Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the  Nature Research Reporting Summary

Chemical engineering Materials for energy and catalysis Solar cells
Abstract Perovskite solar cells have reached a power conversion efficiency over 25%, and the engineering of the interface between the perovskite and hole transport layer (HTL) has been crucial to achieve high performance. Here we design a bifunctional molecule CBz-PAI with carbazole-triphenylamine and phenylammonium iodide units to passivate defects at the perovskite/HTL interface. Owing to a favourable energy level alignment with the perovskite, the CBz-PAI acts as a hole shuttle between the perovskite layer and the HTL. This minimizes the difference between the quasi-Fermi level splitting of the perovskite, or ‘internal’
V oc , and the external device
V oc , thus reducing voltage losses. As a result, solar cells incorporating CBz-PAI reach a stabilized power conversion efficiency of 24.7% and maintain 92.3% of the initial efficiency after 1,000 h under damp heat test (85 °C and 85% relative humidity) and 94.6% after 1,100 h under maximum power point-tracking conditions.

Main Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on mixed organic–inorganic halide perovskite, delivering higher energy conversion efficiency with lower processing costs, have been served as a promising electricity generation technology 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 . The past decade has witnessed a rapid increase of power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 25% (refs.
13 , 14 , 15 ). Efficient charge extraction and low non-radiative recombination at the interface between the perovskite material and hole transport layer (HTL) are key for achieving excellent photovoltaic (PV) performance 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 . Passivation of defects especially at the perovskite/HTL interface has become a crucial method for reducing non-radiative charge carrier recombination inside PSC devices 24 . In addition, interfacial passivation layers have been recently reported to be able to improve the stability of PSCs due to their resistance against moisture and thermal stress 25 , 26 , 27 . For example, phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) and octylammonium iodide (OAI) are widely used interfacial modulators for PSCs, reducing defect-assisted non-radiative recombination and improving device stability 14 , 28 , 29 . However, such interfacial layers are generally disordered and exhibit poor charge transport properties due to unfavourable energy level matching, impairing hole extraction 30 , 31 , 32 . There have been efforts to introduce interface modulators exhibiting good energy level alignment with the perovskite layer to improve charge transfer 20 , 33 , 34 , 35 ; however, device performances of these works are far from state-of-the-art. Recently, two-dimensional (2D) layered perovskites based on bulky cations applied to the surface of three-dimensional (3D) perovskite thin films to generate 2D/3D heterojunction with better band alignment have attracted considerable attention, and a significant improvement in device performance has been shown 22 , 36 . Energy level misalignment between the perovskite absorber layer and HTL layers causes a voltage loss due to enhanced radiationless charge carrier recombination at the interface between the two layers. In the presence of such a valence band offset, the hole concentration in the HTM has to be raised to a higher level to match the quasi-Fermi level in the two layers than in the absence of band misalignment. This in turn accelerates radiationless carrier recombination causing an additional voltage loss. This
V oc
loss can be avoided for example by introducing a layer of molecular dipoles between the perovskite and the HTM that compensates the valence band offset 37 . Furthermore, perovskites based on organic–inorganic hybrids are hydrophilic materials while the widely used HTLs (such as spiro-OMeTAD) are hydrophobic. This causes poor wetting of the perovskite by the HTL layer, which results in further parasitic resistive losses in PSC devices 38 , 39 . These limitations prompted us to develop a molecularly tailored interface layer with two functions, a good interface passivation to minimize non-radiative recombination and one allowing for a barrier-free hole transfer into the HTL, and to investigate its beneficial effects in depth. In this Article, we judiciously designed and synthesized a bifunctional organic molecule, 4-(3,6-bis(4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)-9 H -carbazol-9-yl)benzenaminium iodide (CBz-PAI) containing carbazole-triphenylamine (CBz) and phenylammonium iodide (PAI) moieties (Fig.
1a ). The PAI unit acts as an effective defect passivator, whereas the conjugated structure of methoxy-substituted triphenylamine that is highly compatible with the spiro-OMeTAD layer enables excellent hole transfer or hole shuttling from the perovskite into the HTL layer. Since the HOMO energy level is well adjusted by the conjugated structure of CBz unit, CBz-PAI shows a very small valence band edge/HOMO energy level misalignment of 40 meV with the perovskite layer, voltage losses are minimized and the efficient hole shuttling mechanism leads to a lower series resistance. The mechanism behind these minimized voltage losses due to this energy level alignment is revealed in this work by a detailed optoelectronic device characterization corroborated by drift-diffusion simulations. Due to the bifunctionality, the PSC device achieved a PCE of 24.7% under simulated air mass (AM) 1.5G illumination. Notably, non-encapsulated CBz-PAI-based PSC device exhibited an excellent long-term stability, with 94.6% of the initial PCE being retained after 1,100 h measurement under maximum power point (MPP) tracking condition.

and Supplementary Fig.
1 , the synthesis of CBz-PAI started from Suzuki reaction of 3,6-dibromo-9 H -carbazole and (4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)boronic acid affords compound 1. Then the Buchwald–Hartwig reaction of compound 1 and 1-fluoro-4-nitrobenzene was employed to yield compound 2, followed by being reduced by stannous chloride dihydrate to get compound 3. Subsequently, acidification of compound 3 with hydriodic acid was performed to achieve the final compound CBz-PAI. All the key intermediates and the final compound CBz-PAI were characterized by
1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR),
13 C NMR and high-resolution mass spectrometry (Supplementary Figs.
2 – 13 ). The size of the CBz-PAI molecule was also calculated to be 28.865 Å (Supplementary Fig.
14 ). The ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) absorption of CBz-PAI, PbI 2
and CBz-PAI/PbI 2
(molar ratio 2:1) was characterized to investigate the interaction between PbI 2
and CBz-PAI (Fig.
1b ). The absorption of PbI 2
dramatically changes after mixing with CBz-PAI, which indicates a strong interaction between CBz-PAI and PbI 2 . Moreover, the colour of PbI 2
film transforms from yellow to transparent pale yellow (inset of Fig.
1b ). In addition, the
1 H NMR spectrum of CBz-PAI has changed after mixing with PbI 2
(Supplementary Fig.
15 ), confirming the interaction between CBz-PAI and PbI 2 . Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement of CBz-PAI with ferrocene as the reference shows the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of −5.36 eV against vacuum (Fig.
1c ). Then the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of CBz-PAI is calculated to be −2.26 eV based on its bandgap of 3.10 eV. As seen in the energy level diagram (Fig.
1d ), the valence band offset between CBz-PAI and perovskite (−5.40 eV) generates a driving force of 40 meV for hole transfer from perovskite to CBz-PAI. Generally, the deep HOMO energy level of −5.36 eV allows for a favourable band alignment with the perovskite, which might minimize voltage loss of the resulted device. In addition, the good compatibility of CBz-PAI and HTL suggests an efficient hole transport from CBz-PAI to HTL layer, which we will discuss in greater detail later. Film properties To further disclose the optical and electronic properties of perovskite film with and without CBz-PAI, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was applied to investigate the effect of CBz-PAI on the morphology of perovskite film (Fig.
2 a,b ). Surprisingly, the average domain size of the perovskite increases from 750 nm to 1,260 nm after being treated by CBz-PAI (Supplementary Fig.
16 ). The formation of larger domain could be attributed to the interaction between CBz-PAI with excess PbI 2
at the perovskite surface (dotted circle in Fig.
2a ), where CBz-PAI may act as a ‘coalescer’ at the perovskite surface 29 . Elemental mapping of the CBz-PAI-treated perovskite film demonstrates the existence of carbon and oxygen on the perovskite surface (Supplementary Figs.
17
and
18 ), confirming the incorporation of CBz-PAI overlayer. The optical properties of perovskite films were also characterized by UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig.
19 ). As expected, the CBz-PAI-treated perovskite film shows a similar absorption spectrum as the pristine perovskite film 40 . In addition, we measured the optical bandgap by UV–Vis spectroscopy and the first derivative of external quantum efficiency (EQE), being 1.512 eV and 1.526 eV (Supplementary Fig.
20 ), respectively. The bandgap determined from EQE is usually 10–20 meV lower than that determined from UV–Vis spectra 41 , which is in good agreement with our results. Fig. 2: Characterization of the FAPbI 3

The centre line represents the median value, the bounds of box indicate upper and lower quartiles and the whiskers represent the minimum and maximum values. Full size image To further investigate the structural characteristics of the perovskite films with and without CBz-PAI treatment, synchrotron-based grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) was performed (Fig.
2c,d ). The GIXRD does not provide evidence for a 2D structure and only supports the notion that there is a reaction between CBz-PAI and PbI 2
which removes PbI 2
at the interface. This result is consistent with the phenomenon we observed in the SEM measurement (Fig.
2a,b ). Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) was employed to evaluate the difference in the surface potential of the perovskite films (Fig.
2e–g ), which is associated with the work function with respect to the vacuum energy level. The KPFM image of the pristine perovskite film shows notable dark areas inside individual grains indicating a heterogeneous surface potential distribution (Fig.
2e ), while the perovskite film treated by CBz-PAI presented a more evenly distributed surface potential (Fig.
2f ). This difference may be ascribed to the partial elimination of subgap defect states. The work functions of the perovskite films are further determined by the contact potential difference (CPD) between the Pt-coated conductive cantilever probe and the samples. The perovskite film with CBz-PAI treatment showed an average CPD of −63.1 mV (Fig.
2f ), which is 51.2 mV lower than that of perovskite film without CBz-PAI coating (Fig.
2e ). This downward shift indicates a more positive surface charging that is caused by a hole transfer from the perovskite valence band into the CBz-PAI HOMO level. Such a hole transfer is energetically favoured as discussed above since the CBz-PAI HOMO level is 40 meV higher than the perovskite valence band edge. Note that in a full device with HTM there is no positive charging of the CBz-PAI interface layer; due to a 390 meV higher HOMO level of the HTM (Fig.
1d ), a charge transfer from the CBz-PAI layer into the HTM is energetically favoured. Thus, the increase in device
V oc , which will be discussed later, is not directly related to the change in surface potential. Absolute intensity photoluminescence (AIPL) measurements were performed to determine the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) to study the effect of CBz-PAI on the optoelectronic quality of the perovskite films (Figs.
2h,i ). Five samples were prepared for both control and perovskite/CBz-PAI conditions. The average PLQY of the control sample is 6%, whereas the average PLQY of perovskite/CBz-PAI is 16%, illustrating significant reduction of non-radiative recombination of the CBz-PAI treated compared with the pristine perovskite film. This shows that CBz-PAI acts as a defect passivation agent. Device performance The target device configuration used in this study is based on the architecture shown in Fig.
3a . In the following we denote the device with CBz-PAI as the target device. For the control device we use PEAI as passivation layer. We also made devices without interface passivation layer and with OAI as modulator; however, a statistical analysis revealed that for our device recipe PEAI yielded the highest device performance (Supplementary Figs.
21
and
22 ). Different concentrations of CBz-PAI were used to optimize the PV performance of PSC devices; for PEAI we used the established recipe 28 . Current density–voltage ( J–V ) curves for different CBz-PAI concentrations are shown in Supplementary Fig.
23 , and the PV parameters are summarized in Supplementary Table
1 . The CBz-PAI-treated cell with a concentration of 5.04 mM achieves the highest PCE of 24.7% using the anti-reflection coating (Fig.
3b ), with a short-circuit current density ( J sc ) of 26.1 mA cm −2 , an open-circuit voltage ( V oc ) of 1,161 mV and a fill factor (FF) of 81.6% (Table
1 ). The comparison of the PV performance with and without anti-reflection coating and the transmittance of the AR coating are shown in Supplementary Fig.
24 . In contrast, the PCE of the control PSC device is 22.3% (Fig.
3b ), with a
J sc
of 25.9 mA cm −2 , a
V oc
of 1,112 mV and an FF of 77.6%. Fig. 3: PV performance of the control and target PSCs. The control devices use PEAI and the target devices CBz-PAI as interface passivator.

Source data Full size image Table 1 PV parameters of the best-performed control and target devices under 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm −2 ) Full size table In addition, the device based on the perovskite/CBz-PAI/HTL delivered a negligible hysteresis of 0.4% (Supplementary Fig.
25
and Supplementary Table
2 ), which is lower than that of the control device (2.8%). Figure
3c
shows steady-state MPP measurements of the champion devices for 500 s. The stabilized PCEs of the control device and the device with CBz-PAI are 22.1% and 24.5%, respectively, which are consistent with the ones obtained from the
J–V
measurement (Fig.
3b ). Incident photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of devices are shown in Fig.
3d . The integrated current densities of the control and target cells are 25.5 and 25.8 mA cm −2
(Supplementary Fig.
26 ), respectively, which are also in good agreement with the
J-V
measurements (Fig.
3b ). Furthermore, a statistical analysis of the PV parameters of 20 devices was carried out (Fig.
3e
and Supplementary Fig.
21 ). CBz-PAI-based PSCs deliver an average PCE of 24.2%, while the control cells show an average PCE of 21.9%. The devices with CBz-PAI overlayer delivered an enhanced
V oc , FF and PCE. In addition, the ideality factor ( n id ) of the control and target devices was calculated from the dependence of
V oc
on the illumination intensity (Fig.
3f ). The
n id
decreased slightly from 1.4 to 1.3 after introducing the CBz-PAI layer between perovskite and HTL, indicating a very small decrease of trap-assisted non-radiative recombination. Optoelectronic characterization In the following we quantitatively elaborate the mechanisms behind the
V oc
and the FF increase. We measured PLQY of complete CBz-PAI passivated (control) and PEAI passivated (target) devices, which are shown in Fig.
4a . The PLQY is 1.8% for the control device and 1.9% for the target device. Note that CBz-PAI treatment of the bare perovskite film leads to a significant PLQY increase (Fig.
2i ) compared with the untreated perovskite films on glass without HTL, which shows the passivation effect of this treatment. Here we compare complete cells (that is, with electron transport layer (ETL) and HTL) of CBz-PAI-treated perovskite films (target) with PEAI-treated perovskite films (control). The PLQY difference is very small and indicates that the defect passivation effect is only slightly better with CBz-PAI as compared with PEAI, which is in good agreement with the small difference of the solar cell ideality factors shown above (Fig.
3f ). In addition, we observe a lower statistical fluctuation of the PLQY values for the CBz-PAI sample, which indicates a better device reproducibility with the interface passivation. From PLQY we can determine the voltage loss due to non-radiative recombination and the quasi-Fermi level splitting ∆ E F
as described in detail in
Supplementary Information
(Supplementary Note
1 ). In Fig.
4b
we show ∆ E F / q , where
q
is the elementary charge, and the measured steady-state
V oc
of the same devices.
V oc
of the target device increases by 40 mV; however ∆ E F / q
of the same device increases only 10 mV. Thus, the
V oc
increase cannot be explained by a reduction in non-radiative recombination alone. To understand the reason behind the
V oc
increase, we have to consider all factors determining
V oc . The quasi-Fermi level splitting is the ‘internal’
V oc
of the absorber layer, that is, the maximum
V oc
a solar cell with this absorber can attain if there are no additional
V oc
losses. An additional
V oc
loss comes from energy level misalignments between the valence bands of the HTL and perovskite in combination with interfacial non-radiative recombination 42 . In Fig.
1d
we see that the spiro-OMeTAD HTL shows a large valence band edge/HOMO energy level misalignment of 430 meV whereas CBz-PAI has a HOMO level only 40 meV above the perovskite valence band edge. During device operation under illumination, holes are injected from the perovskite layer into the CBz-PAI layer before they reach the spiro-OMeTAD HTL. On the other hand, electron injection into CBz-PAI is blocked due to the significantly higher conduction band edge energy (Fig.
1d ). Therefore, the main interfacial electron-hole recombination happens at the perovskite/CBz-PAI interface where the valence band edge/HOMO level mismatch is very small. This suggests that
V oc
losses at this interface are much lower than at the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface. In the control device, hole injection into the PEAI interface passivation layer is impeded since the PEAI HOMO level is 50 meV below the perovskite valence band (Supplementary Fig.
27 ). Therefore, hole injection is only possible directly (for example via pinholes) or via tunnelling into the spiro-OMeTAD layer with a very large energy level offset. Thus, in this case a larger
V oc
loss compared with the CBz-PAI-based solar cell is expected. To corroborate this, we performed simulations using the drift-diffusion solver Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator (SCAPS) (for more details, see
Supplementary Information ), which are shown in Fig.
4c ). For the control and target devices we used the same simulation parameters (Supplementary Table
3 ) except for a 1 Ω cm 2
higher series resistance for the control device, which will be discussed in detail later. In particular we used the same interface recombination velocity at the interface perovskite/CBz-PAI (target) and perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD (control). More details on the simulations can be found in
Supplementary Information
(Supplementary Note
1b ). The inset of Fig.
4c
shows the quasi-Fermi levels for electrons ( F n ) and holes ( F p ) at
V oc . Calibrating the absolute energy so that
F n
in the ETL is the same for control and target, we see that the main difference is observed in the shape and position of
F p . The control device shows an upward bending of F p
at the HTM/perovskite interface. This is caused by a strong hole accumulation within the HTM and electron accumulation in the perovskite layer at the HTM/perovskite interface due to the large valence band energy misalignment (for more details, see Supplementary Fig.
28 ). Such a carrier accumulation leads to a strong enhancement in non-radiative recombination at the HTM/perovskite interface compared to the target device where such a carrier accumulation does not appear even if the recombination velocities are the same. The resulting simulated
J–V
characteristics match well the measured
J–V
curves. This shows that the main contribution of the
V oc
increase upon CBz-PAI treatment in comparison with PEAI treatment comes from the improved energy level alignment of the passivator molecule and not from an improved defect passivation effect. This is in contrast with most of the findings in literature where a
V oc
increase caused by a passivator is assigned to a reduction of non-radiative recombination. To the best of our knowledge, the mechanism of energy level alignment of a passivator and its effect of increasing
V oc
is demonstrated and rigorously proven, and thus, our interface layer technique represents an important concept to improve device performance of PSCs. Fig. 4: Optoelectronic characterization. The control samples use PEAI and the target samples CBz-PAI as interface passivator.

The error bands indicate standard deviation. Source data Full size image The FF losses in high-performing PSCs with high carrier mobilities are determined by two main factors, non-radiative recombination and series resistance 43 . To quantify these losses, we performed
J sc – V oc
measurements, which is a standard technique to determine the series resistance of solar cell devices 44 , 45 , 46 . We performed
J sc – V oc
measurements with two control and two target devices. In Supplementary Fig.
29 , we show the transport limit
J–V
curves determined from the
J sc – V oc
measurements (details are presented in Supplementary Note
2 ) and the radiative limit
J–V
curves of the control and target devices. In addition, we plot the steady-state maximum power point (ss-MPP) measurements. The radiative limit
J–V
curves were determined using the ideal single-diode approximation with the radiative limit of
V oc  = 1.249 V (details are presented in Supplementary Note
1 ), the measured average
J sc
(25.1 mA cm −2 ) and an ideality factor of 1. The performance parameters of these curves determined from measurements of the two control devices with PEAI and the two target devices with CBz-PAI are recorded in Supplementary Table
4 . The FF of the
J sc – V oc
curve for control and target devices are similar, about 5% abs
lower than the radiative limit FF. This FF loss can be attributed to non-radiative recombination. The fact that the FF of the target devices are very similar to the control ones is in good agreement with the similar non-radiative recombination that has been shown by the device ideality factor and the PLQY measurements as discussed above (Figs.
3f
and
4a ). The FFs determined from the steady-state MPP measurements are 73.5% for control and 76.7% for the target devices, that is, 11% abs
and 8% abs
lower than the ones determined from the
J sc –V oc
curve. This additional FF loss can be attributed to the series resistance
R s , which is 5 Ω cm 2
for the control and 4 Ω cm 2
for the target devices (the details of the calculation are presented in Supplementary Note
2 ). The 1 Ω cm 2
lower series resistance of the target device is the reason for the 3% abs
higher FF. This difference in
R s
can only come from the interface passivation layer since all other layers of the devices contributing to the series resistance are the same. To understand the mechanism behind this decrease in series resistance upon the CBz-PAI treatment compared with the PEAI treatment we have to look at the HOMO energy levels. The CBz-PAI layer has a HOMO level 40 meV above the perovskite valence band edge (Supplementary Fig.
25 ); hence, a good hole transport through this layer into the spiro-OMeTAD HTL is expected. For PEAI, the HOMO level is 50 meV below the perovskite valence band, which should result in a barrier and, thus, in a larger series resistance. This barrier also has an effect on the kinetics of the hole transfer, which we can show by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements on bilayer perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD films with PEAI and CBz-PAI as interface passivation (Fig.
4d ). Although the TRPL traces on a timescale of several hundreds of nanoseconds appear to be very similar (Fig.
4d , inset), a closer look on the first few nanoseconds, where hole transfer dominates the signal decay, reveal with statistical significance a faster decay for the CBz-PAI-treated sample. Thus, the hole transfer from perovskite to HTM is faster with the CBz-PAI-treated sample, which is in good agreement with the elimination of a transport barrier. This barrier is the reason for a higher series resistance of the PEAI device, which we quantified to be 1 Ω cm 2 . Thus, the elimination of this barrier and the concomitant favourable hole transfer from the perovskite layer into the HTL leads not only to reduced V oc
losses as discussed above but also to a higher FF. Device stability The operational stability of the control and target devices was evaluated using full sunlight soaking under the continuous MPP tracking, and the stability results are shown in Fig.
5a . After 1,100 h, the device with CBz-PAI overlayer is capable of maintaining 94.6% PCE of its initial value, while the one for the control device is only 66.6%. Then the measurement of contact angle of the corresponding films was performed to figure out the reason for the improved stability of PSC after CBz-PAI treatment (Supplementary Fig.
30 ). As compared with the perovskite, the contact angle of the hydrophobic chlorobenzene (CB)-based HTL solution droplets on the perovskite/CBz-PAI film decreases from 18.3° to 9.7°, indicating the improved compatibility between the perovskite and the HTL. Additionally, the contact angles of water droplets on the surface of the control sample and the sample with CBz-PAI overlayer are 50.6° and 77.8°, respectively. This obvious difference in water contact angle demonstrates that the surface of the perovskite/CBz-PAI films is more hydrophobic, which is favourable for repelling moisture and slowing down the water penetration into the perovskite film in a moist environment. Moreover, the cross-section of the control and CBz-PAI-based devices was measured by SEM before and after 1,100 h MPP tracking (Fig.
5b,c
and Supplementary Fig.
31 ), which demonstrates that CBz-PAI treatment does not change the crystal quality of perovskite. The void-like features between the perovskite layer and HTL are observed in the aged control device, which could behave as the non-radiative recombination sites to inhibit charge transport. In contrast, thanks to the high compatibility of the conjugated structure in CBz-PAI with HTL layer, no such features appeared in the device with CBz-PAI interlayer after ageing, evidencing that CBz-PAI can enhance the stability of the interface between perovskite layer and HTL layer. Fig. 5: Operational stability test of the control (PEAI as passivator) and target (CBz-PAI) PSC devices. All samples were aged for 1,100 h MPP tracking at 1 sun and 45 °C.

d , e , Mapping of TOF-SIMS signals of I −
in the HTL for control device ( d ) and target device ( e ). Full size image Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS) was applied to analyse the spatial distribution of the key perovskite components within Spiro-MeOTAD layer for the aged control and target PSC devices (Fig.
5d,e ). The mapping signal of I −
in Spiro-MeOTAD is counted and represented by pixel ratio. It is clearly observed that the aged control device showed extremely strong signal of I − , while the signal is significantly reduced in the aged device with CBz-PAI compared with the control PEAI device. This result shows that the incorporated CBz-PAI layer strongly suppresses the undesired migration of I −
ions from perovskite to HTL, thus preventing the device from fast degradation. We also analysed the depth profile of I −
and Li +
within the cells by TOF-SIMS (Supplementary Fig.
32 ). The I −
signal in the PEAI control device is much higher in the HTL than that of the device with CBz-PAI interlayer. Meanwhile, the diffusion of Li +
from HTL layer to the perovskite layer is also effectively reduced in the device with CBz-PAI interlayer, which is considered to be one of the reasons for the small hysteresis of the target device. These results show that the CBz-PAI interlayer can not only improve the stability of the interface between perovskite and HTL layers, it can also suppress the migration of I −
from perovskite to HTL, as well as the diffusion of Li +
from HTL to perovskite, thus resulting in outstanding stability of the target PSC device. Remarkably, the damp heat (85 °C and 85% relative humidity) test showed that the device with CBz-PAI retained 92.3% of its maximum PCE after 1,000 h (Supplementary Fig.
33 ). Furthermore, we carried out more detailed experiments on higher thermal/light stability by using the more stable PTAA and P3HT as HTL. The target device retained 78.5% and 91.1% of the initial PCEs after 500 h under continuous full light illumination at 80 ± 5 °C with PTAA and P3HT as HTL (Supplementary Fig.
34 ), respectively. Our results demonstrate that CBz-PAI as interface engineering material can effectively enhance the device performance and operational reliability of n-i-p PSCs. Conclusion In summary, a bifunctional molecule CBz-PAI with two functional groups, a CBz unit and PAI, was developed and used as an interface layer between perovskite and HTM, whose role is to afford interfacial defect passivation, tolerance of energy level misalignment between the valence band of the perovskite and that of the hole conductor and chemical compatibility with the HTL, resulting in a greatly improved device performance.

Fluorine-doped tin oxide (10 Ω per square) conductive glass was purchased from Nippon Sheet Glass. The transmittance is shown in Supplementary Fig.
35 . Preparation of electron transport layer The FTO substrate was cleaned by 2% Hellmanex III (HellmaAnalytics), deionized water, acetone and IPA for 10 min each. Then an air gun was used to remove the remaining ethanol, and the films were treated by ultraviolet-ozone for 15 min before use. The Chemical Bath Deposition solution was prepared by mixing 625 mg of urea, 625 μl of HCl, 12.5 μl of thioglycolic acid and 137.5 mg of SnCl 2 ·2H 2 O per 50 ml of deionized water 48 . FTO glass substrate was dipped in the solution for 3 h. Then deionized water was used for ultrasonic cleaning for 5 min to remove the remaining large particles, and the SnO 2
film was annealed on a hot stage at 180 °C for 1 h. The Chemical Bath Deposition process was repeated for several times to achieve the desired thickness, and followed by annealing at 180 °C for 1 h. Preparation of the perovskite precursor Then, 1.56 M perovskite precursor solutions (FAPbI 3
crystal:0.35 methylammonium chloride) in a mixture solvent of DMF/DMSO (4:1, by volume) with 0.12 mM of PbI 2
as a dopant were prepared using a previously reported method 13 . Synthesis of FAPbI 3
crystal: 1.0 M FAPbI 3
perovskite precursor solutions were prepared by dissolving equimolar formamidinium iodide and PbI 2
in g-butyrolactone after shaking for 1–2 h. The solutions were filtered using polytetrafluoroethylene filter with 0.22 mm. Seed crystals of 0.5–2 mm in size were first obtained by placing 1 ml precursor solutions at 131 °C for 30 min in a hotplate. To obtain a larger FAPbI 3
crystal, we can transfer small-sized crystals to a 1 M pre-heated fresh solution, and continue growth under 90 °C. The as-obtained large-size single crystals were taken out from the hot precursor solutions. The residual solution of the large-size single crystals was removed by ether and subsequently dried at 150 °C for 1 h. The photos of preparing FAPbI 3
crystals and FAPbI 3 -based perovskite precursor solutions are shown in Supplementary Fig.
36 . Preparation of the Spiro-OMeTAD solution The Spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by firstly dissolving 72.3 mg Spiro-OMeTAD in 1 ml CB. After that, 17.5 µl Li-TFSI (from 520 mg ml −1
stock acetonitrile solution) and 28.8 µl tBP was added into the solution. Preparation of the P3HT layer The P3HT layer was deposited onto perovskite film by spin-coating P3HT solution (P3HT (10 mg) in 1 mL CB) at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. Preparation of the PTAA layer The PTAA was dissolved in toluene (10 mg ml −1 ) with additives of 7.5 μl bis(trifluoromethane)sulphonimide lithium salt/acetonitrile (170 mg ml −1 ) and 4 μl tBP. PTAA layer was deposited onto perovskite film by spin-coating PTAA solution at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. Device fabrication The perovskite precursor was spin-coated on FTO/SnO 2
substrates. The first step was carried out at 1,000 r.p.m. with an acceleration rate of 200 r.p.m. s −1
for 10 s. The second step followed at 5,000 r.p.m. with an acceleration rate of 1,000 r.p.m. s −1
for 30 s. At the last 15th second, a 110 µl anti-solvent of CB was drop-coated, and then the as-deposited films were annealed at 150 °C for 15 min. After cooling the perovskite-coated substrate, for CBz-PAI treatment, the CBz-PAI solution was dissolved in IPA with different concentrations ranging from 0 mM to 10 mM and spin-coated onto the perovskite surface at a spin rate of 5,000 r.p.m. and annealed at 100 °C for 5 min. For PEAI treatment, the PEAI solution was dissolved in IPA with the concentrations of 20 mM and spin-coated onto the perovskite surface at a spin rate of 5,000 r.p.m. and annealed at 100 °C for 5 min. Then, the Spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated on the perovskite films at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. Finally, gold was deposited using thermal evaporation at a pressure of ~3 × 10 −4  Pa. PV performance measurements Current–voltage ( J–V ) characteristics were recorded under ambient temperature (23 °C) and ambient air conditions. The PSCs were measured using a 450 W xenon light source solar simulator (ORIEL Sol3A CLASS AAA 94043A) from Newport and were kept at room temperature by a constant flow of compressed air at a temperature of 23 °C. A silicon photodiode with KG3 filter, calibrated by an A2LA-accredited PV and calibration test laboratory (Newport, PV Calibration Lab), was used as reference cell for light intensity calibration. In the measurement evaluation a spectral mismatch factor of 0.962 was taken into account. It was determined from the solar simulator spectrum, the AM1.5 spectrum and the EQE spectra of the test and reference cells. A Keithley 2400 source meter was used for current–voltage measurements with a scan rate of 50 mV s −1 . The cells with an active area of 0.25 cm 2
(0.5 cm × 0.5 cm) were masked with a black metal mask with an area of 0.158 cm 2 . EQE spectra were recorded with a commercial system (Arkeo-Ariadne, Cicci Research s.r.l.) based on a 300 W xenon light source and a holographic grating monochromator (Cornerstone, Newport). The operational stability of the cells was measured under a white-light-emitting diode lamp with biologic MPG2 potentiostat and was performed under a continuous nitrogen flow. The device area is masked to around 0.16 cm 2 . The light intensity is set to reflect 1 sun condition, and the actual current is adjusted according to in-time calibration results from the silicon diode. Steady-state MPP and
V
oc
measurements If not otherwise stated, steady-state MPP and
V oc
measurements were carried out under simulated 1 sun illumination with cooling by a constant flow of compressed air at a temperature of 23 °C for 60 s. For the steady-state
V oc
measurements we used a black metal mask with an area of 36 mm 2
(6 mm × 6 mm), which is slightly bigger than the cell active area, to homogeneously illuminate the entire cell. This method guarantees that the real stabilized active area
V oc
is measured and not one that reflects the parallel connection of an illuminated cell and a shaded cell. NMR measurements 1 H and
13 C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance III-400 MHz NMR spectrometer. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (p.p.m.,
δ ).
1 H NMR and
13 C NMR spectra were referenced to tetramethylsilane (0 p.p.m.) or solvent residual peak (3.58 p.p.m. or 2.50 p.p.m. for
1 H NMR and 67.21 p.p.m. for
13 C NMR) as internal standard. Mass spectra were collected on a HITACHI-80 mass spectrometer. Photoluminescence lifetime and UV–Vis measurements The photoluminescence lifetime was measured via time-correlated single photon counting using a LifeSpec II (Edinburgh Instruments) fluorescence spectrometer with a picosecond-pulsed diode laser (EPL-510, Edinburgh Instruments) at 510 nm wavelength and 85 ps pulse width. UV–Vis absorption and transmission spectra were measured using a Varian Cary 5 spectrometer (Varian). Powder X-ray diffraction measurement Powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the mechanosynthesized samples were recorded with a Bruker D8 Discover Vario diffractometer with a Cu Kα1 monochromator (1.540598 Å). SEM and atomic force microscopy/KPFM measurements The SEM images were acquired using field-emission SEM (Zeiss Merlin). Atomic force microscopy height images and KPFM were attained by a Cypher, Asylum Research in tapping mode, using Pt:Si-coated tips (AC240TM, Olympus). PLQY measurement PLQY was measured using an integrating sphere (Fluorolog, Horiba JobinYvon), an Andor Kymera 193i spectrograph and a 660 nm continuous-wave laser (OBIS, Coherent) set at 1-sun equivalent photon flux (1.1 µm beam full-width half-maximum, 632 µW); photoluminescence was collected at normal incidence using a 0.1 numerical aperture, 110-µm-diameter optical fibre. For the calibration of the PLQY measurements we used a halogen lamp (HL-3 plus CAL from Ocean Optics). To check the correctness of the calibration we measured PLQY of a dye solution of indocyanine green in DMSO in the same setup and measured PLQY values within 15% deviation from the literature values. GIWAXS measurements GIWAXS measurements were performed at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility Laboratory on Beamline BL14B1 using X-ray with a wavelength of
λ  ≈ 1.24 Å. Two-dimensional GIWAXS patterns were acquired by a Mar CCD mounted vertically at a distance ~194 mm from the sample with a grazing incidence angle of 0.5° and an exposure time of 50 s. The 2D GIWAXS patterns were analysed using the FIT2D software and displayed in scattering vector
q
coordinates with
q  = 4 π sin θ / λ , where
θ
is half of the diffraction angle and
λ
is the wavelength of incident X-ray. SCAPS simulations SCAPS is a drift-diffusion solver that has been developed by the group of M. Burgelman at the University of Gent. It can be obtained from

Photovoltaics Solar cells
Abstract All-perovskite tandem solar cells hold the promise of surpassing the efficiency limits of single-junction solar cells 1 , 2 , 3 ; however, until now, the best-performing all-perovskite tandem solar cells have exhibited lower certified efficiency than have single-junction perovskite solar cells 4 , 5 . A thick mixed Pb–Sn narrow-bandgap subcell is needed to achieve high photocurrent density in tandem solar cells 6 , yet this is challenging owing to the short carrier diffusion length within Pb–Sn perovskites. Here we develop ammonium-cation-passivated Pb–Sn perovskites with long diffusion lengths, enabling subcells that have an absorber thickness of approximately 1.2 μm. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that widely used phenethylammonium cations are only partially adsorbed on the surface defective sites at perovskite crystallization temperatures. The passivator adsorption is predicted to be enhanced using 4-trifluoromethyl-phenylammonium (CF3-PA), which exhibits a stronger perovskite surface-passivator interaction than does phenethylammonium. By adding a small amount of CF3-PA into the precursor solution, we increase the carrier diffusion length within Pb–Sn perovskites twofold, to over 5 μm, and increase the efficiency of Pb–Sn perovskite solar cells to over 22%. We report a certified efficiency of 26.4% in all-perovskite tandem solar cells, which exceeds that of the best-performing single-junction perovskite solar cells. Encapsulated tandem devices retain more than 90% of their initial performance after 600 h of operation at the maximum power point under 1 Sun illumination in ambient conditions.

all-perovskite tandem solar cells
Article
29 March 2023
Main Metal-halide perovskites are emerging photovoltaic (PV) materials that are suitable for tandem solar cell applications: their bandgaps can be tuned from approximately 1.2 eV to 3.0 eV through compositional engineering 2 . An all-perovskite tandem solar cell is constructed by stacking a mixed bromide/iodide wide-bandgap (WBG, approximately 1.8 eV) perovskite front cell and a mixed lead–tin (Pb–Sn) narrow-bandgap (NBG, approximately 1.2 eV) perovskite back cell 4 , 7 . All-perovskite tandem solar cells unite low-cost solution processing with the prospect of high efficiency 8 . Despite this promise, the certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of all-perovskite tandem solar cells has yet to surpass that of single-junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs) (which have a highest certified PCE of 25.5%) 9 , a limitation that is dominated by the low photocurrent density (below 16 mA cm −2 ) seen in all-perovskite tandem solar cells to date 4 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 . Considering the current-matching condition, high photocurrent densities will require a Pb–Sn perovskite active layer more than 1 μm thick in the bottom subcell (Extended Data Fig.
1 ). However, efficient (>20%) Pb–Sn PSCs have so far only been demonstrated using an active-layer thickness of less than  1 μm (refs.
6 , 10 , 11 , 13 , 14 , 15 ). We reason that this is due to the short carrier diffusion length of polycrystalline Pb–Sn perovskite thin films: the carrier diffusion length should be several times the absorber thickness to ensure sufficient charge transport and good PV performance in PSCs 16 , 17 . Grain surface passivation is a promising route to increase the carrier diffusion length of perovskite films 13 , 18 , given that grain surfaces (film surface and grain boundaries) exhibit a trap density one to several orders of magnitude higher than that within the grain 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 . Two-dimensional (2D) perovskites, Lewis bases/acids 23
and zwitterions 10
have been used for the passivation of Pb–Sn perovskites, all of which are approaches that address deep traps and reduce Sn 2+
oxidation 24 , 25 , 26 . However, until now, the absorber thickness of grain-surface-passivated Pb–Sn PSCs has been limited to less than 1 μm in optimized devices 10 , 11 , 15 , 27 . This we attribute to insufficient defect passivation: a certain amount of surface area remains unpassivated, due to the incomplete adsorption of passivating agent into the defective sites during film formation 28 . We posit that enhancing the adsorption of passivating agents during perovskite film formation—in effect, increasing the completeness of the coverage using passivators, ensuring that they fully interact with the defective sites on the grain surfaces—could further improve passivation and thus increase the diffusion length in thick Pb–Sn perovskite films. This will enable thicker absorber layers in Pb–Sn PSCs and thus higher matched photocurrent densities in all-perovskite tandem solar cells. We note that this requires further progress to be made in the rational molecular design of passivators. Previous works have designed passivating molecules based on a static picture of the interaction between passivators and perovskite surfaces 29 ; here we instead explore the dynamic process of passivator adsorption on grain surfaces using ab initio molecular dynamic simulations, an approach that guided our experimental design. Density functional theory studies Here we investigated the passivation capability of ammonium cations for mixed Pb–Sn perovskite surfaces 30 , 31 , 32 . Three aromatic ammonium cations, phenethylammonium (PEA), phenylammonium (PA) and 4-trifluoromethyl-phenylammonium (CF3-PA), were selected to study how the molecular properties influence the adsorption and binding on mixed Pb–Sn perovskite surfaces (Fig.
1a ). The electrostatic potentials ( φ max ) at the –NH 3 +
side are different for the three passivators:
φ max,PEA  <  φ max,PA  <  φ max,CF3-PA
(Fig.
1a ). We posited that this electrostatic potential difference could affect the surface adsorption of ammonium cations 33 . We carried out density functional theory (DFT) simulations to study the surface adsorption and defect passivation for the three ammonium cations (see details in the  Methods ). As illustrated in Fig.
1b , the three passivators interact with acceptor-like defects at the Pb–Sn perovskite surfaces through ionic bonding and hydrogen bonding, and are therefore anchored on the surfaces. We note that this mechanism of passivator adsorption is distinct from that of Lewis base molecules 18 . Fig. 1: Interaction between passivator and Pb–Sn perovskite surface. a , The molecular structures of three passivators (PEA, PA and CF3-PA). PA and CF3-PA exhibit molecular structures similar to that of PEA, but without any alkyl chain between the benzene ring and ammonium group. Corresponding Gaussian calculated electrostatic potentials ( φ ) are shown. The right colour bar from red to blue marks the increase of electropositivity.
b , Schematic diagram of the interaction between ammonium cations with the acceptor-like defects, that is, formamidinium (FA) vacancy (V FA ), methylammonium (MA) vacancy (V MA ), Sn vacancy (V Sn ), Pb vacancy (V Pb ), I substituted at Sn site (I Sn ) and I substituted at Pb site (I Pb ). Both the A-I and B-I terminated (001) perovskite surfaces are considered.
c , Ab initio molecular dynamics snapshots and top views of the CF3-PA, PA and PEA adsorbed perovskite surfaces at a temperature of 400 K. F atoms, green; N atoms in PA and PEA cations, red. The desorbed molecules are highlighted with blue dashed circles in the top views.
d , The number of adsorbed molecules for CF3-PA, PA and PEA at temperatures of 300 and 400 K. A molecule number of 16 represents complete surface coverage in the simulation unit.
e , The binding energy ( E b ) between passivators and various acceptor-like defects. Full size image The passivator adsorption is a dynamic process that occurs during perovskite crystallization at elevated temperatures. We first investigated, using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, the dynamic process of passivator adsorption on the grain surface (see details in the  Methods
and Supplementary Fig.
1 ). CF3-PA has the strongest tendency to anchor on the perovskite surface during film formation (at a temperature of approximately 400 K), with all 16 cations adsorbed completely on the surface (Fig.
1c, d ). In comparison, one PA cation and three PEA cations are not adsorbed into the A-site vacancies. Iodide ions are also seen to escape from the surface at 400 K in the PA and PEA cases (Fig.
1c ), which indicates that CF3-PA not only increases the probability of adsorbed ammonium cations on the perovskite grain surface but also suppresses the formation of iodine vacancies on the surface at elevated temperatures. Reduced iodide desorption may also suppress the formation of iodine interstitial (I i ) defects 34 . The binding energies ( E b ) shown in Fig.
1e
indicate that CF3-PA has the strongest binding with acceptor-type defects on the perovskite grain surface. The highly electronegative fluorine atom in CF3-PA withdraws electron density strongly from the neighbouring atoms, leaving a higher electropositivity at the NH 3 +
side, thus enhancing the binding with the negatively charged defects. Looking at the electronic structures, one can see that the deep in-gap states from the I Sn
and I Pb
antisite defects are eliminated (Supplementary Fig.
2 ). In addition, CF3-PA passivation is predicted to increase the defect formation energy of the Sn vacancy (V Sn ), reducing the numbers of vacancies (Supplementary Fig.
3 ). CF3-PA passivation also reduces the formation of donor-type defects (Supplementary Note  1 and
Supplementary Figs.
4
and
5 ). PV performance of Pb–Sn PSCs DFT calculations indicated that CF3-PA has the potential to provide more effective grain surface passivation than does conventional PEA. To test this idea, we fabricated mixed Pb–Sn PSCs with a thick absorber layer (approximately 1.2 μm) to evaluate the effect of passivating agents on materials and device characteristics. We incorporated the passivating agents onto the grain surfaces of Pb–Sn perovskite films by adding PEA, PA and CF3-PA directly into the perovskite precursor solutions ( Methods ). The optimal concentrations of PEA, PA and CF3-PA were 0.2, 0.3 and 0.3 mol%, respectively (Extended Data Fig.
2 ). Figure

compare the PV parameters of the control, PEA PA and CF3-PA solar cells (15 devices for each type) with an absorber layer thickness of 1.2 μm fabricated over several identical runs. Compared with control devices, Pb–Sn PSCs with passivating agents showed improved performance across all PV parameters. Among the three passivators investigated here, CF3-PA resulted in the best performance values of open-circuit voltage ( V oc ), short-circuit current density ( J sc ), fill factor (FF) and thus PCE.

curves and PV parameters are summarized in Fig.
2b , Extended Data Fig.

and Supplementary Table
2 . The
J sc
values of the CF3-PA devices increased with thickness, reaching approximately 33 mA cm −2
at a thickness of 1.2 μm. The increased
J sc
with thicker absorber is ascribed to higher light absorption at the near-infrared range, as indicated by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra in Fig.
2c . By contrast, the
J sc
values of the control devices did not exhibit an increase when the thickness was increased from 900 to 1,200 nm, whereas the
V oc
and FF values (and thus PCE) dropped considerably with thickness beyond 900 nm (Extended Data Fig.
3 ). This indicates that the photogenerated carrier transport limits the performance in thick devices based on the control material processing strategy (Extended Data Fig.
4a ). By adding CF3-PA, we increased the diffusion length to achieve higher
J sc ,
V oc
and FF values. We fabricated more than 200 CF3-PA mixed Pb–Sn PSCs with 1.2-μm-thick absorber; a histogram of their PCE values is shown in the inset of Fig.
2d . The devices exhibited an average PCE of 20.8 ± 0.5%, which is a narrow distribution compared with typical Pb–Sn perovskite statistics. The best CF3-PA device showed a PCE of 22.2% (stabilized 22.0%), with a
V oc
of 0.841 V, a
J sc
of 33.0 mA cm −2
and a FF of 80% under reverse scan (Fig.
2d
and Extended Data Fig.

presents the EQE spectra of the best CF3-PA device, with the integrated

value of 32.5 mA cm −2 , in good agreement with the

characterization. Characterization of Pb–Sn perovskites To understand the improvement of device performance by passivating agents, we performed structural and optoelectronic characterization of Pb–Sn perovskite films. We first investigated the effect of passivating agents on the morphology and crystal structure of Pb–Sn perovskite films. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that introducing the passivator additives did not notably affect the surface morphology (Fig.
3a, b
and Supplementary Fig.
6
and Extended Data Fig.
5a, b ). The presence of passivating agents (for example, CF3-PA) in the perovskite films is indicated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements (Extended Data Fig.
5c ). The spatial distribution of the CF3-PA cations within the perovskite film was investigated using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS, Extended Data Fig.
5d ). This revealed that passivators were anchored on the top and bottom film surfaces as well as at the grain boundaries within the film. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the control and the films modified by the passivating agent exhibited a single three-dimensional (3D) perovskite phase without a 2D (reduced-dimensional) phase and without non-perovskite phases (Fig.
3c
and Supplementary Fig.
7 ). We found no diffraction peaks relating to 2D layered perovskites even when a large amount of CF3-PA (for example, 20 mol%) was added to the precursor solution (Supplementary Note  2
and Supplementary Fig.
8 ). The absence of 2D perovskite is beneficial for charge transport and extraction throughout the thick Pb–Sn perovskite absorber in solar cells. We also extended the structural characterization to different thicknesses of Pb–Sn perovskite films (Supplementary Note  2 and
Supplementary Fig.
9 – 11 ). The above results indicate that the introduction of a trace amount of passivating agent is not likely to change the film formation. Fig. 3: Characterization of mixed Pb–Sn perovskite films with passivating agents. a ,

f , Mobilities and diffusion lengths of the CF3-PA and control Pb–Sn perovskite films. Full size image To examine the extent of surface Sn 2+
oxidation, we performed angle-dependent XPS measurements (Extended Data Fig.
6a ). Spectra were recorded at electron take-off angles of 0 o , 45 o
and 75 o , with the probing depth varying from approximately 6–8 nm at 0 o
to 1.5–2 nm at 75 o
(ref.
28 ). The XPS spectra for the control film only show a Sn 4+
peak for the most surface sensitive angle at 75 o
(Extended Data Fig.
6b ), which indicates that Sn 4+
primarily forms on the surface 28 . Surface Sn 2+
oxidation was successfully suppressed after anchoring of CF3-PA on the grain surfaces (Extended Data Fig.
6f ), indicating that passivation of surface defects (for example, undercoordinated Sn atoms and Sn vacancies) could retard the Sn 2+
oxidation 21 , 30 . The three passivators were then assessed using steady-state photoluminescence (PL). The PL intensity was increased noticeably with the CF3-PA passivating agent (Fig.
3d ), implying suppressed non-radiative charge recombination through the defects. An enhanced PL intensity was also observed in perovskite films passivated with PEA and PA, but it was not as strong as that with CF3-PA. In addition, we carried out time-resolved PL to study the charge-carrier dynamics (Fig.
3e ). The perovskite films with passivating agents exhibited effective carrier lifetimes (CF3-PA,
τ  = 966 ns; PA,
τ  = 437 ns; PEA,
τ  = 365 ns) that were much longer than that of the non-passivated control film ( τ  = 159 ns). The longer charge-carrier recombination lifetime with CF3-PA was also confirmed by transient photovoltage decay measurements (Supplementary Fig.
12 ). We further performed femtosecond-resolved optical-pump terahertz-probe spectroscopy to obtain the carrier mobility of Pb–Sn perovskite films 35 , 36 , 37 . The control and CF3-PA films exhibited similar effective d.c. charge-carrier mobilities ( μ d.c. ) of approximately 80 cm 2  V −1  s −1 , where
μ d.c.
is the sum of the electron and hole mobilities ( μ d.c.  =  μ e  +  μ h , Supplementary Note  3
and Supplementary Fig.
13 ). Although it is challenging to obtain directly the exact mobility of electrons versus holes, we found the mobility of the limiting carrier ( μ e,h ) to be 11.7 ± 1.5 and 8.2 ± 1.2 cm 2  V −1  s −1
for the CF3-PA and control Pb–Sn perovskite films, respectively (see details in Supplementary Note  3
and Supplementary Fig.
14 ). Because of the longer carrier lifetimes, the diffusion length ( L d ) of the CF3-PA passivated films was increased threefold when compared to that of the control films (5.4 μm versus 1.8 μm) (Fig.
3f ). Overall, device performance and film characterization demonstrate improved grain surface passivation in mixed Pb–Sn perovskite films with CF3-PA. The DFT studies suggest one possible mechanism for the origin of the improvement: the higher surface adsorption of the passivating agent enables better passivation in perovskite films. Performance and stability of tandem solar cells We fabricated monolithic all-perovskite tandem solar cells using the optimized NBG perovskite layers described above (see details in the  Methods ). The WBG solar cells exhibited a PCE of 17.3%, with a
V oc
of 1.22 V, a
J sc
of 17.4 mA cm −2
and a FF of 81.6% (Extended Data Fig.
7 ). The NBG perovskite films were fabricated using the CF3-PA additive. The thicknesses of the WBG and NBG absorber layers for the front and back subcells were optimized to be approximately 380 and 1,200 nm (Fig.
4a ), respectively, to obtain a high matched current density between the subcells. Fig. 4: PV performance and stability of all-perovskite tandem solar cells with CF3-PA additive. a , Cross-sectional SEM image of an all-perovskite tandem solar cell.

The CF3-PA and control tandem devices had initial PCEs of 25.6% and 24.3% measured under a two-lamp simulator, respectively. The device temperature was approximately 35  o C during operation, which was a result of self-heating under solar illumination. There was no active cooling during device operation and the environmental temperature was kept at approximately 25  o C.

presents the
J–V
curves of all-perovskite tandem devices with various thicknesses (750, 900 and 1,200 nm) for the NBG absorber; the corresponding PV parameters are summarized in Supplementary Table
3 . The
J sc
values, as determined from the
J–V
curves, were increased from 15.4 to 16.5 mA cm −2
when the thickness of the NBG perovskite absorber increased from 750 to 1,200 nm (the WBG perovskite thickness was kept at approximately 380 nm). Correspondingly, the PCE was increased from 25.0% for the 750-nm-thick NBG subcell to 26.4% for the 1.2-μm-thick NBG subcell. The higher
J sc
is due mainly to the higher spectral response (light absorption) in the back subcell, as shown in Fig.
4c
and Supplementary Fig.
15 . We fabricated 96 all-perovskite tandem solar cells (with aperture area of 0.049 cm 2 ) with 1.2-μm-thick NBG subcells; the devices had an average PCE of 25.6 ± 0.5% (Extended Data Fig.
8a ). Figure
4d
shows the
J–V
curves of the best-performing tandem device measured from both reverse and forward scans, showing very minor hysteresis. The best tandem cell had a PCE of 26.7% from the reverse scan (with a
V oc
of 2.03 V, a
J sc
of 16.5 mA cm −2
and a FF of 79.9%) and exhibited a stabilized PCE of 26.6% (Extended Data Fig.
8 b and Extended Data Table
1 ). The integrated
J sc
values of the front and back subcells from EQE spectra (Fig.
4e ) were 16.7 and 16.8 mA cm −2 , respectively, agreeing well with the
J sc
value determined from the
J–V
measurements. The
J sc
achieved (≥16.5 mA cm −2 ) was considerably higher than those reported in previous works (typically <16 mA cm −2 ) 12 , 13 , 38 , mainly because of the use of thicker NBG perovskite without sacrificing the electrical performance (that is,
V oc
and FF) with the use of CF3-PA additive. We also fabricated tandem cells with larger area; our best-performing large-area device (aperture area = 1.05 cm 2 ) exhibited a PCE of 25.3% with a
V oc
of 2.03 V, a
J sc
of 16 mA cm −2
and a FF of 78% (Fig.
4f
and Extended Data Fig.
9 ). The relatively modest performance gap between small-area and large-area devices was ascribed to improved film uniformity in Pb–Sn perovskites films as a result of the addition of formamidine sulfinic acid (FSA) in the precursor solutions 10 . We sent tandem solar cells to an accredited independent PV calibration laboratory (Japan Electrical Safety and Environment Technology Laboratories, JET). These delivered certified stabilized PCEs of 26.4% and 26.1% (Supplementary Fig.
16 ). This value of the PCE has been included in recently published Solar Cell Efficiency Tables (version 58) 9 . The certified PCE of 26.4% exceeds that of other thin-film solar cells and is comparable to that of the best single-crystalline silicon solar cells (Supplementary Table
4 ). We anticipate that the PCE of all-perovskite tandem solar cells can improve further (Supplementary Note  4 ). To assess the stability of tandem solar cells, we first tracked their shelf life by storing the unencapsulated devices under dark conditions in an N 2
glovebox. The tandem devices exhibited no obvious PCE degradation after 2,400 h of aging (Supplementary Fig.
17 ). In addition, we investigated the operating stability of the CF3-PA and control tandem devices: we kept the encapsulated devices in ambient air and used maximum power point (MPP) tracking under simulated 1 Sun illumination (using a multicolour light-emitting diode (LED) solar simulator with intensity equivalent to 100 mW cm −2 ). The spectrum of the LED simulator is presented in previous work 39 . CF3-PA-passivated tandem devices maintained 90% of their initial PCE after 600 h of MPP operation and exhibited improved operating stability compared to unpassivated devices (Fig.
4g ). The high efficiency together with the promising stability achieved here indicate a step towards viability for all-perovskite tandem solar cells. Methods DFT simulation Ab initio molecular dynamic simulations were performed with the CP2K package 40
in the constant-volume and constant-temperature ( NVT ) ensemble. The temperature was controlled with a Nosé–Hoover thermostat 41
at room temperature (300 K) and 400 K. The time step was set to 1.0 fs. A PBE-D3 functional was used with double-zeta basis sets (DZVP-MOLOPT) 42
and Goedecker–Teter–Hutter pseudopotentials 43 . The cut-off was set to 560 Ry. We constructed the FA 0.75 MA 0.25 Pb 0.5 Sn 0.5 I 3
(001) surface (approximately 25 × 25 Å 2 ) with a 25 Å vacuum in the
z
direction. The ammonium cations were initially placed in the
z
direction away from the perovskite surface with a distance of 2.5 Å. The ab initio molecular dynamic simulations were run for approximately 10–20 ps to ensure equilibrium. First-principles calculations based on DFT were carried out using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package 44 . The generalized gradient approximation of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional was used as the exchange-correlation functional 45 . In addition, we used the DFT-D3 method for the van der Waals correction and also dipole corrections for the slab calculations 46 . A plane-wave cut-off energy of 400 eV was used. The energy and force convergence criteria were set to 10 −5  eV and 0.03 eV Å −1 , respectively. The Brillouin zone was sampled with Γ-centred
k -mesh densities of 2π × 0.02 Å −1
in the calculations of the energetic and electronic properties. We used a vacuum of 20 Å to separate neighbouring surfaces in the
z
-direction. The binding energies ( E b ) of different ammonium cations (CF3-PA, PA and PEA) with the perovskite surface were calculated as
E mol/pvsk  –  E pvsk  –  E mol , where
E mol/pvsk ,
E pvsk
and
E mol
are the total energies of the adsorption system, the perovskite system and CF3-PAI/PAI/PEAI (I represents iodide), respectively. The electrostatic potentials ( φ ) of the passivators were calculated using the Gaussian 09 package at the B3LYP/def2TZVP level with DFT-D3. The maximum
φ
( φ max ) of the NH 3 +
terminal group in these passivators was obtained with the help of Multiwfn code 47 . Materials All materials were used as received without further purification. The organic halide salts (FAI, FABr, MAI, FAI, PEACl, PACl, CF3-PACl) were purchased from GreatCell Solar Materials (Australia). Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) aqueous solution (Al 4083) was purchased from Heraeus Clevios (Germany). N4,N4'-Di(naphthalen-1-yl)-N4,N4'-bis(4-vinylphenyl)biphenyl-4,4'-diamine (VNPB) was purchased from Lumtec. PbI 2
(99.99%), CsI (99.9%) and CsBr (99.9%) were purchased from TCI Chemicals. SnI 2
(99.999%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. SnF 2
(99%), dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8% anhydrous), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9% anhydrous), formamidine sulfinic acid (≥98%), ethyl acetate (99.8% anhydrous) and chlorobenzene (99.8% anhydrous) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. C 60
was purchased from Nano-C (USA). Bathocuproine (BCP) (>99% sublimed) was purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology (China). Perovskite precursor solution NBG FA 0.7 MA 0.3 Pb 0.5 Sn 0.5 I 3
perovskite The precursor solution was prepared in mixed solvents of DMF and DMSO with a volume ratio of 2:1. The molar ratios for FAI/MAI and PbI 2 /SnI 2
were 0.7:0.3 and 0.5:0.5, respectively. The molar ratio of (FAI+MAI)/(PbI 2 +SnI 2 ) was 1:1. SnF 2
(10 mol% relative to SnI 2 ) was added to the precursor solution. The precursor solution was then stirred at room temperature for 2 h. Tin powders (5 mg ml −1 ) and formamidine sulfinic acid (0.3 mol%) were added to the precursor to reduce Sn 4+
in the precursor solution and toimprove film uniformity. For solution with passivating agents, PEACl, PACl or CF3-PACl was added to the precursor solution at their optimized concentrations. It is noted that we introduced additives at a concentration lower than 0.4 mol% relative to the B-site metal cations, which is below the concentration of large A-site cations required to form 2D/3D heterostructures. The precursor solution was filtered through 0.22 μm Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane before making perovskite films. WBG FA 0.8 Cs 0.2 Pb(I 0.62 Br 0.38 ) 3
perovskite The precursor solution (1.2 M) was prepared from six precursors dissolved in mixed solvents of DMF and DMSO with a volume ratio of 4:1. The molar ratios for FAI/FABr/CsI/CsBr and PbI 2 /PbBr 2
were 0.48:0.32:0.12:0.08 and 0.62:0.38, respectively. The molar ratio of (FAI+FABr+CsI+CsBr)/(PbI 2 +PbBr 2 ) was 1:1. The precursor solution was stirred at 50  o C for 2 h and then filtered through a 0.22 μm PTFE membrane before use. We found in our previous work that the six precursor approach improved the photostability and suppressed phase-segregation of the WBG perovskites, compared with those fabricated from four precursors (CsI, FAI, PbI 2
and PbBr 2 ) 10 . We also noted that the halide segregation in WBG perovskites was dependent on illumination intensity (Supplementary Fig.
18 ). The WBG perovskite films had a composition Cs 0.2 FA 0.8 PbI 1.86 Br 1.14
and a slightly lower bandgap (approximately 1.76 eV) than that used in our previous work 10 , in order to obtain a higher matched current density in all-perovskite tandem solar cells, enabled by a thicker Pb–Sn perovskite absorber. Device fabrication Mixed Pb–Sn perovskite solar cells The prepatterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates were sequentially cleaned using acetone and isopropanol. PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated on ITO substrates at 4,000 rpm for 30 s and annealed on a hotplate at 150 °C for 10 min in ambient air. After cooling, we transferred the substrates immediately to a nitrogen-filled glovebox for the deposition of perovskite films. The perovskite films were deposited with a two-step spin-coating procedure: (1) 1,000 rpm for 10 s with an acceleration of 200 rpm s –1
and (2) 4,000 rpm for 40 s with a ramp-up of 1,000 rpm s –1 . Ethyl acetate (300 µl) was dropped onto the spinning substrate during the second spin-coating step at 20 s before the end of the procedure. The substrates were then transferred on to a hotplate and heated at 100 °C for 10 min. After cooling down to room temperature, the substrates were transferred to the evaporation system. Finally, C 60
(20 nm)/BCP (7 nm)/Cu (150 nm) were sequentially deposited on top of the perovskite by thermal evaporation (Beijing Technol Science). The thickness of the Pb–Sn perovskite layer was varied by changing the concentration of the precursor solution: 1.6 M for 750 nm, 2.0 M for 900 nm, 2.2 M for 1,050 nm, 2.4 M for 1,200 nm and 2.8 M for 1,450 nm. All-perovskite tandem solar cells NiO nanocrystal (25 mg ml −1
in water) layers were first spin-coated on ITO substrates at 3,000 rpm for 30 s and annealed on a hotplate at 130 °C for 30 min in air. NiO nanocrystals were synthesized as reported previously 48 . After cooling, the substrates were immediately transferred to the glovebox. VNPB (1 mg ml −1 ) in chlorobenzene without doping was spin-coated on the NiO film at 6,000 rpm for 30 s and was then annealed at 150  o C for 10 min. The WBG perovskite films were deposited on top of the VNPB-modified NiO with a two-step spin-coating procedure: (1) 2,000 rpm for 10 s with an acceleration of 200 rpm s –1
and (2) 6,000 rpm for 40 s with a ramp-up of 2,000 rpm s –1 . Chlorobenzene (200 µl) was dropped onto the spinning substrate during the second spin-coating step at 20 s before the end of the procedure. The substrates were then transferred onto a hotplate and heated at 100 °C for 15 min. After cooling down to room temperature, the substrates were transferred to the evaporation system and a 20-nm-thick C 60
film was subsequently deposited on top by thermal evaporation at a rate of 0.2 Å s –1 . The substrates were then transferred to the atomic layer deposition (ALD) system (Veeco Savannah S200) to deposit 20 nm SnO 2
at low temperatures (typically 100  o C) using precursors of tetrakis(dimethylamino) tin ( iv ) (99.9999%, Nanjing Ai Mou Yuan Scientific Equipment Co., Ltd) and deionized water. After ALD deposition, the substrates were transferred back to the thermal evaporation system to deposit an ultra-thin layer of Au clusters layer (approximately 1 nm) on ALD-SnO 2 . PEDOT:PSS layers were spin-cast on top of the front cells and annealed in air at 120  o C for 20 min. After the substrates had cooled, we immediately transferred them to a nitrogen-filled glovebox for the deposition of NBG perovskite films with identical procedures used for the single-junction devices. Finally, 20 nm C 60 , 7 nm BCP and 150 nm Cu films were sequentially deposited by thermal evaporation (Beijing Technol Science). Details on the deposition of ALD-SnO 2
layers can be found in our previous work 10 . Characterization of solar cells For single-junction solar cells, the
J–V
characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter under the illumination of a solar simulator (EnliTech, Class AAA) at a light intensity of 100 mW cm −2
as checked with NREL calibrated reference solar cells (KG-5 and KG-0 reference cells were used for the measurements of the WBG and NBG solar cells, respectively). Unless otherwise stated, the
J–V
curves were all measured in a nitrogen-filled glovebox with a scanning rate of 100 mV s −1
(with voltage steps of 20 mV and a delay time of 100 ms). The active area was determined by the aperture shade masks (0.049 or 1.05 cm 2 ) placed in front of the solar cells. EQE measurements were performed in ambient air using a QE system (EnliTech) with monochromatic light focused on the device pixel and a chopper frequency of 20 Hz. For tandem solar cells, the measurements of the
J–V
characteristics were carried out under the illumination of a two-lamp high spectral match solar simulator (SAN-EI ELECTRIC, XHS-50S1). The spectrum from the simulator was finely tuned to ensure that spectral mismatch was in the region of 100 ± 3% for each 50 nm interval in the wavelength range of 400–1,000 nm. The solar simulator was set at a light intensity of 100 mW cm −2
as checked with a calibrated crystalline silicon reference solar cell with a quartz window (KG-0). We note that a dual-lamp solar simulator, rather than a single Xe lamp, is preferred for the characterization of tandem solar cells, due to the better spectral match with AM1.5G solar irradiance (see the detailed discussion in Supplementary Note  5 ). EQE measurements were performed in ambient air and the bias illumination from very bright LEDs with emission peaks of 850 and 460 nm were used for the measurements of the front and back subcells, respectively. No bias voltage was applied during the EQE measurements of the tandem solar cells. Stability tests of solar cells The operating stability tests were carried out under full AM1.5G illumination (Class AAA, multicolour LED solar simulator, Guangzhou Crysco Equipment Co. Ltd) 39
with an intensity of 100 mW cm −2
using a home-made LabVIEW-based MPP tracking system and a Perturb and observe method in ambient conditions (under a humidity of 30–50%). The solar cells were encapsulated with a cover glass and ultraviolet (UV) epoxy (Three Bond), which was cured under an UV-LED lamp (peak emission at 365 nm) for 3 min. No UV filter was applied during operation. The environmental temperature was kept at around 25  o C. The solar cell temperature increased to approximately 35 °C under illumination as no active cooling was implemented at the measurement stage. The illumination intensity was regularly calibrated to check the degradation of the LED lamp. The assessments of the dark long-term shelf stability of the solar cells (without encapsulation) were carried out by repeating the
J–V
characterizations at various times and the devices were stored in a N 2
glovebox. Femtosecond-resolved optical-pump-terahertz probe spectroscopy A commercial Ti:Sapphire amplified laser (Libra, Coherent) with a pulse duration of 90 fs, centre wavelength of 800 nm and repetition rate of 1 kHz was used to generate terahertz radiation by optical rectification in a 0.5-mm-thick ZnTe(110) nonlinear single crystal. The radiation was detected using free-space electro-optic sampling in a 0.5-mm-thick ZnTe(110) crystal. Perovskite thin films deposited on z-cut quartz substrates were photoexcited at 800 nm with fluences in the range of 1.5–50 μJ cm −2 . The change in terahertz amplitude was monitored as a function of the time delay between the 800 nm optical pump pulse and the terahertz probe pulse using a translation stage. All measurements were carried out in a nitrogen-purged environment to avoid potential degradation of the perovskite films in ambient air. Optical simulation of tandem solar cells A validated optical model GenPro4 as developed by Delft University of Technology was used for the optical modelling of the tandem solar cells 49 . The complex refractive index of each layer was measured by a spectroscopic ellipsometer (J.A. Woollam). The implied photocurrent density of each subcell can be calculated using GenPro4 by assuming that the individual absorptances of the front and back cells are equivalent to the EQE of the two cells, respectively. The current density of the tandem cell is determined by taking the lower value between the two subcells. Other characterizations SEM images were obtained using a TESCAN microscope with an accelerating voltage of 2 kV. XRD patterns were collected using a Rigaku MiniFlex 600 diffractometer equipped with a NaI scintillation counter and using monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (wavelength
λ  = 1.5406 Å). The grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering data were recorded using an Xeuss 2.0 system with an X-ray beam size of 100 × 100 μm 2 . The photon energy was 8 keV ( λ  = 1.54 Å) and the incident angle was 0.05° (relative to the top surface of the perovskite films) or 0.5°. The diffracted X-rays were collected by a Pilatus 300k detector at a distance of 160 cm. XPS analysis was carried out using a Thermo Scientific Al K-Alpha XPS system with energy steps of 0.1 eV. Angle-dependent XPS characterizations were performed with a PHI 5600 ultrahigh vacuum system with a hemispherical electron energy analyser, an Al Kα source (1,486.6 eV, PHI 04-548 dual anode X-ray source) for excitation and a pass energy of 23.5 eV for XPS acquisition 28 . Optical absorption measurements were carried out on a Lambda 950 UV/Vis spectrophotometer. Transient photovoltage decays were measured on a home-made system. A 540 nm green LED was used to modulate
V oc
with a constant light bias and the repetition rate was set to 2,000 Hz. A white LED was illuminated on the active area of the solar cell under study for constant light bias. The intensity of the pulsed illumination was set in such a way that the modulated
V oc
was approximately 10 mV, to ensure a perturbation regime. The open circuit voltage transient, induced by the light perturbation, was measured with a digital oscilloscope set to an input impedance of 1 MΩ. The charge recombination lifetime was fitted by a single exponential decay. Steady-state PL and time-resolved PL were measured using a Horiba Fluorolog time-correlated single-photon-counting system with photomultiplier tube detectors. The light was illuminated onto the top surface of the perovskite film. For steady-state PL measurements, the excitation source was a monochromated Xe lamp (peak wavelength at 520 nm with a line width of 2 nm). For time-resolved PL, the excitation source was a green laser diode ( λ  = 510 nm) with an excitation power density of 5 mW cm −2 . The PL decay curves were fitted with biexponential components to obtain fast and slow decay lifetimes. The mean carrier lifetimes
τ
for the biexponential fit were calculated by the weighted average method. ToF-SIMS was performed using ToF-SIMS6 from IONTOF GmbH. Samples were analysed in the dual-beam profiling mode. All profiles were performed in the non-interlaced mode. Spectral data were acquired in the high mass-resolution mode. The primary ion for analysis was 30 keV Bi 3+
at 0.3 pA (with Bi liquid metal ion source). This ion beam was applied over a 50 × 50 μm 2
area at the centre of the sputter crater. The sputter ion was 1 keV Ar +
at 120 nA (with Ar electron impact ion source). A 200 × 200 µm 2
sputter crater was used. During the sputtering process, the mass spectra in the same layer were consistent and different layers had well-defined profiles, which means that beam damage was not observed. The MA cation, FA cation, CF3-PA cation, Pb +
and Sn +
were identified based on masses of 32.0483
amu , 45.0430
amu , 162.0551

amu
and 119.8997

For regular thinner Pb-Sn perovskite solar cells (thicknesses of 750 and 900 nm), the diffusion lengths are sufficiently long to ensure charge transport within devices. This agrees with the finding that no obvious improvement was observed in regular thinner devices after we added the CF3-PA passivating agent. The abrupt drop in performance at the thickness of 1.45 μm comes because the precursor solution fails to form high-quality films, a result of finite solubility of metal halides in DMF/DMSO solvent. Extended Data Fig. 4 Performance of champion mixed Pb-Sn perovskite solar cells. a , EQE spectra of champion control and CF3-PA mixed Pb-Sn solar cells. The EQE values of CF3-PA device are substantially higher than those of previous works at wavelengths above 800 nm, mainly due to the use of thicker absorber while maintaining sufficient carrier transport.
