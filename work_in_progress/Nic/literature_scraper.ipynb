These ammonium cations can either assemble as a thin molecular layer at the perovskite surface or induce the formation of a low-dimensional (usually two-dimensional) perovskite capping layer on top of the three-dimensional perovskite. The formation of these two different structures is often overlooked by researchers, although they impact differently on device operation. In this Review, we seek to distinguish between these two passivation layers. We consider the conditions needed for the formation of low-dimensional perovskite and the electronic properties of the two structures. We discuss the mechanisms by which each method improves photovoltaic efficiency and stability. Finally, we summarize the knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to better understand and optimize ammonium cation-based passivation strategies.\\nYou have full access to this article via your institution.\\nDownload PDF\\nDownload PDF\\nSimilar content being viewed by others\\nTailoring passivators for highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells\\nArticle\\n18 July 2023\\nAll-perovskite tandem solar cells with improved grain surface passivation\\nArticle\\n17 January 2022\\nAmmonium cations with high p K a\\nin perovskite solar cells for improved high-temperature photostability\\nArticle\\n28 September 2023\\nMain Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of >26% 1 , attracting the attention of photovoltaics manufacturers. Recent improvements in efficiency have been enabled by the passivation of trap states at the surface of the perovskite film or at the interface between the perovskite and contact layers 2 . Generally surface passivation layers are deposited using solution processing, but they can be evaporated or physically stacked. The most widely used materials to passivate perovskite film surfaces are ammonium ligand salts with alkylammonium chains, cyclic or aromatic ammonium cations and typically a halide anion (Fig.\\n1a ). Ammonium cations in these salt solutions can bind to the perovskite surface via A-site vacancies or hydrogen bonding, forming a thin molecular layer on top of the perovskite (Fig.\\n1b ). However, under some conditions (discussed herein), these large ammonium cations can also transform the surface of three-dimensional (3D) perovskite, replacing the A site to form low-dimensional perovskite structures, most commonly 2D perovskite (Fig.\\n1c ). 2D perovskite is obtained by slicing the 3D perovskite along its inorganic planes. A layered system is formed where inorganic layers are spaced by large organic cations with the structure R 2 A n −1 Pb n I 3 n +1 , where R is the spacer cation, A is the A site to a 3D perovskite and\\nn\\nis the number of 3D perovskite units sandwiched between the bulky ligands, defining the so-called dimensionality of the system. These structures can be purely 2D ( n \\u2009=\\u20091) or quasi-2D ( n \\u2009≥\\u20092). For simplicity herein, both are referred to generically as 2D perovskite unless distinction between the two structures is required. Fig. 1: Ammonium cation-based 2D and molecular passivation layers. a , Examples of ammonium cations and anions for salts used for the passivation of defects at the surface/interface of the 3D perovskite layer. Some cations can form a 2D perovskite (under certain conditions), but others cannot.\\nb , c , Perovskite crystal surfaces passivated by either a molecular cation passivation layer ( b ) or a 2D passivation layer ( c ).

In this case, A is formamidinium, B is Pb and X is iodine.\\nd , Timeline of certified PSC PCEs.

Note that for many of the data points there were insufficient data to determine whether the cell was passivated with a 2D perovskite passivation layer or a molecular cation passivation layer, thus we grouped the two together. Source data Full size image Figure\\n1d\\nshows that the vast majority of PSCs with certified efficiency above 23% PCE use a 2D or molecular cation passivation layer based on ammonium cations. For most of these entries, a detailed analysis of the passivation layer was not provided; thus, it is unclear whether a 2D passivation layer, a molecular cation passivation layer or a mixed phase was formed. This lack of distinction limits physical understanding of the passivation process and the mechanisms underlying device performance improvement enabled by the two methods. In this Review, we strive to draw distinctions between these two passivation modes, analysing the factors driving the formation of low-dimensional structures and examining their properties once deposited over the 3D perovskite layer, as well as their impact on device performance. Ammonium cation-based molecular and 2D passivation layers 2D passivation layers can be formed by direct or indirect methods. Direct methods transfer already formed 2D perovskite onto a 3D film surface (Fig.\\n2a ). These methods include physically stacking 3D and 2D films 3\\nor using solvents that dissolve the 2D but not the 3D perovskite to solution process 2D perovskite precursors directly onto a 3D surface 4 . Typically, however, 2D passivation layers and molecular cation passivation layers are formed using the same method: dissolution of the passivating ligand (either as an amine or an ammonium salt) into a solution that is then coated onto the perovskite surface (often followed by an annealing step) (Fig.\\n2b,c ). In cases whereby 2D perovskite is formed, it is formed indirectly from the 3D perovskite; thus, we refer to this as the indirect method. Fig. 2: Fabrication methods to produce a 2D or molecular cation passivation layer. a , Direct fabrication using pre-made 2D perovskite deposited atop 3D perovskite to form a 2D/3D heterostructure.\\nb , c , Indirect fabrication where ammonium cations are deposited onto a 3D perovskite surface and either no conversion occurs and a molecular cation passivation layer forms ( b ) or conversion from 3D to 2D perovskite takes place to form a 2D/3D heterostructure ( c ). Full size image There are three potential outcomes of the indirect method, as shown in Fig.\\n3a,d,g . In the first case (Fig.\\n3a ), the passivating ligand does not intercalate with the 3D perovskite and does not form a 2D structure. Rather, it assembles as a molecular layer either fully or partly covering the surface of the 3D perovskite. In the second case (Fig.\\n3d ), some of the ligand reacts with the 3D perovskite, forming a non-conformal layer of 2D perovskite. In the third case (Fig.\\n3g ), enough ligand reacts with the 3D perovskite to form a conformal layer of 2D perovskite atop the 3D perovskite. Mapping of the ligand surface coverage requires extremely precise and surface-sensitive measurements; thus, it is difficult to ascertain the conformality of passivating molecular cation layers. However, due to quantum confinement, 2D perovskite produces distinct photoluminescence compared with 3D perovskite; thus, it is easier to determine the conformality of a 2D passivation layer. The conformality of either passivation layer is important as it affects both efficiency (through band alignment and charge extraction) and stability (through ion blocking and moisture protection).

Full size image Some fabrication methods generate an unambiguous result (that is, the direct deposition of a pre-made 2D perovskite will form a conformal 2D/3D heterostructure, whereas the deposition of an ammonium ligand that cannot form a 2D perovskite will produce a molecular passivation layer). Uncertainty arises when using indirect methods with ammonium ligands that can form 2D perovskite: conflicting reports in the literature suggest that either a 2D perovskite or a molecular layer can form depending on the processing conditions. For example, phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) can generate a 2D perovskite in the form of PEA 2 PbI 4 . However, once a PEAI solution is coated onto a 3D perovskite surface, some studies show that a 2D phase forms spontaneously 5 , whereas others find that 2D perovskite forms only if the film is heated 2 . Many reports use a PEAI treatment (or similar) without investigating whether 2D perovskite is present; thus, a general ambiguity exists around how 2D passivation layers or molecular cation passivation layers affect device physics. Additionally, as mentioned above, even if the 2D perovskite is visible in photoluminescence measurements it is not necessarily a conformal layer. Hyperspectral photoluminescence images of 3D perovskite films treated with ammonium ligands from Ugur et al. 6\\nreveal that 2D perovskite may form conformally or in a discontinuous manner (Fig.\\n3b,e,h ). This is supported by transmission electron microscopy images from other studies (Fig.\\n3c,f,i ). Thus, to compare molecular cation and 2D perovskite passivation, we must first describe the parameters that control the formation of 2D perovskite, after which we can focus on reports that clearly distinguish between 2D passivation layers and molecular cation passivation layers. Here we consider reports that show conformal 2D layers only, as other reports may have non-conformal layers that are probably a mix of 2D and molecular cation passivation (as in Fig.\\n3b ); thus, it is difficult to distinguish between each passivation type. The conformality of molecular cation layers is difficult to determine, but these layers are distinct from 2D passivation layers and thus a useful comparison is possible. Conditions required to form 2D perovskite passivation layers Density functional theory calculations consistently show that the formation energy of 2D perovskite is lower than that of a 3D structure: this drives the conversion from 3D to 2D upon exposure of 3D perovskite to 2D cations 7 . 2D cations bisect slabs of 3D perovskite as there is increasing thermodynamic favourability to replace 3D cation-terminated perovskite with 2D cation-terminated perovskite 5 . Whether a spacer cation can form 2D perovskite has been extensively studied by Kanatzidis and colleagues 8\\nwho examined formation in solution with other perovskite precursors. They suggest that the propensity for 2D perovskite to form is governed by six factors (spacer charge, shape, size, solubility, hydrogen bonding and reactivity): (1) the spacer charge must be 1+ to form a Ruddlesden–Popper structure or 2+ to form a Dion–Jacobson structure; (2) there is an increasing chance of formation for ligands with decreased steric hindrance around the ammonium group (RNH 3 + \\u2009>\\u2009R 2 NH 2 + \\u2009>\\u2009R 3 NH + \\u2009>\\u2009R 4 N + , where R is an alkyl chain or other functional group); (3) there is a requirement for a chain length of ≥3 and ≤18 and between three and six carbon atoms in membered rings (as greater than six will be greater than the width of the MX 6\\noctahedra of the perovskite); (4) solubility is a prerequisite for solution processing; (5) hydrogen bonding alters the arrangement of spacers; and (6) reactivity in solution impacts the spacer you intend to use. These rules also apply to 3D-to-2D conversion to form a 2D/3D heterostructure, meaning that butylammonium can form a 2D passivation layer, whereas tetramethylammonium cannot. However, various examples exist, suggesting that the formation dynamics are more complex in 3D-to-2D conversion. For instance, phenethylammonium 2 , pyrene-methylammonium 9 , pyrene-ethylammonium 9 , octyldiammonium 10\\nand octylammonium 11\\ncan all form 2D perovskite single crystals but have been observed not to induce conversion from 3D to 2D perovskite under certain circumstances. Thus, indirect formation of 2D/3D heterostructures requires an expansion of the factors identified by Kanatzidis and colleagues. Confirming the non-existence of a 2D phase is non-trivial as evidence from one technique may be disproven by another. For example, X-ray diffraction (XRD) is often used to distinguish 2D from 3D perovskites as the crystal structure of 2D perovskite is elongated compared with its 3D counterpart. However, Caiazzo et al. 12\\nfound that films treated with a 1\\u2009mg\\u2009ml −1\\nsolution of 2 H -benzotriazol-2-ylethylammonium iodide in isopropanol (IPA) showed no obvious 2D structural peaks on XRD, but photoluminescence associated with 2D perovskite was visible 12 . Thus, we can only provide a sensible list of properties that (in addition to the rules from Kanatzidis and coworkers) influence 2D/3D formation when using an indirect deposition method. These are summarized in Fig. 4 and include: the concentration of ligand in solution; temperature; solvent polarity; 3D perovskite composition; anion steric hindrance; and the reactivity between 2D and 3D cations. Definitive studies comparing different ligands in all possible variations do not exist. Still, a summary and discussion of these parameters is provided below. Concentration of ligand in solution For 2D perovskites to form, the concentration of large cations must be high enough to intercalate and produce a coherent structure. Various studies compare ligand concentration with 2D perovskite formation using XRD, photoluminescence and absorption measurements 12 , 13 , but—as mentioned above—it is difficult to make definitive statements based on these data. A comprehensive study was undertaken by Lai et al. 14\\nwho washed Cs 0.12 FA 0.8 MA 0.08 PbI 1.8 Br 1.2\\nfilms with different concentrations of 2-thiophene ethylammonium chloride (TEACl) in IPA. XRD results showed a 2D phase only for films washed with >1\\u2009mg\\u2009ml −1\\nsolutions of TEACl. Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), they found that the A site/Pb ratio only exceeded 1 for TEACl concentrations ≥1\\u2009mg\\u2009ml −1 . As this is necessary in the formation of TEA 2 PbI 4 , it suggests that the 0.5\\u2009mg\\u2009ml −1\\nwash resulted in one of the scenarios depicted in Fig.\\n3a,d : either no 2D perovskite formation or only partial coverage. For >1\\u2009mg\\u2009ml −1\\nTEACl concentrations, either scenario from Fig.\\n3d,g\\nis the result: partial or conformal 2D coverage. Degani et al. 15\\nused sputtering XPS to determine whether or not a 2D passivation layer had formed. They washed Cs 0.05 (FA 5/6 MA 1/6 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3\\nfilms with a low-concentration solution of 4-chloro-phenylethylammonium iodide (Cl-PEAI) (2\\u2009mM in CB:IPA (9:1)) and annealed the films at 100\\u2009°C for 30\\u2009min. The chloride signal in XPS from Cl-PEA disappeared after etching only 0.5\\u2009nm into the film surface. As XPS is highly surface sensitive (~2\\u2009nm penetration depth) and one unit cell of PEA 2 PbI 4\\nis ~1.7\\u2009nm, the researchers concluded that using a low enough concentration of ligand (even one that can in principle form a 2D perovskite) will result in the formation of a passivation layer atop 3D perovskite without the formation of any 2D structure. Hyperspectral images from these films suggest that they are uniformly passivated, although as the passivation layer is so thin it is difficult to determine conformality 16 . Temperature As previously mentioned, after washing a perovskite film with a 2D-forming ligand solution, the formation of 2D perovskite may be induced by heating. The foremost example of this came from Jiang et al. 2 , who showed that surface PbI 2\\nreacts with PEAI to form PEA 2 PbI 4\\nupon heating. Similar results have been seen for 3-(trifluoromethyl) phenethylammonium iodide (CF3-PEAI) 17 . Additionally, in situ XRD has shown that a similar conversion for\\nn -hexyl trimethyl ammonium bromide occurs after annealing 18 . Kodalle et al. 19\\nexamined PEAI washing using in situ photoluminescence measurements. They found that some 2D perovskite is produced immediately upon deposition of PEAI, but more is formed during annealing. Interestingly, long-term annealing studies from Park 20\\nand Chakkamalayath 21\\nshow that PEAI-passivated films lose diffraction and emission from 2D perovskite when annealed for over 1\\u2009h, suggesting that the 2D passivation layer is less stable than usually considered 22 , 23 . This is discussed further in the stability section. Solvent polarity Using a solvent with high polarity, such as IPA or dimethylformamide dissolves some of the underlying perovskite when washing the film. This can result in favoured formation of quasi-2D perovskite over purely 2D perovskite 24 . Using high concentrations of ligand salt in IPA results in crystallization of 2D perovskite from PbI 2\\nto form 2D platelets on the film surface. Mixing in non-polar solvents results in slower crystallization via ligand intercalation and gradual dimensional reduction 5 . Studies by Bawendi, Hagfeldt and colleagues 22 , 23\\nsuggest that when using purely non-polar solvents such as chloroform the formation of 2D perovskite is dependent on the presence of PbI 2\\nat the surface. A lack of PbI 2\\ninhibits the formation of 2D perovskite, leaving more unreacted ammonium salt 22 , 23 . 3D perovskite composition The A-site bond strength is higher in perovskites using inorganic caesium at the A site compared with formamidinium (FA) or methylammonium (MA), making all-inorganic cells thermally stable at temperatures above 100\\u2009°C 25 , whereas FA cells are stable below 95\\u2009°C 26\\nand MA-based cells are stable below 60\\u2009°C 27 . Logically, one would expect resistance to 2D ligand ingress to follow the same pattern, and evidence exists to support this. For example, Li et al. 28\\nfound that even after washing CsPb(I x Br 1- x ) 3\\nfilms with extremely high concentrations of PEAI in IPA (100\\u2009mM), no 2D perovskite formation occurred. 2D formation did occur on a CsPbI 3\\nfilm after washing with a 12\\u2009mM solution of phenylbutylammonium iodide in IPA:CB (1:4), suggesting that the less stable structure of CsPbI 3\\ncompared with CsPb(I x Br 1- x ) 3\\nmay allow for ligand intercalation 29 . Additionally, Proppe et al. 5\\nobserved that when MAPbI 3\\nundergoes conversion from 3D to 2D, it occurs via intercalation with PbI 2\\nsheets, whereas using FA-based 3D perovskite, larger slabs of 3D perovskite are broken down via gradual dimensional reduction, suggesting that MA is more easily displaced than FA in the reaction process. Anion steric hindrance The factors identified by Kanatzidis and colleagues tell us that increased steric hindrance around the ligand ammonium group reduces the propensity for 2D perovskite to form. A recent report from Tan et al. 11\\nsuggests that the steric hindrance of the salt anion may also play a role. They found that after washing (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05\\nfilms with 10\\u2009mM solutions of octylammonium-X in IPA, 2D perovskite was only formed for X\\u2009=\\u2009I or Br and not for X\\u2009=\\u2009BF 4\\nor tosylate. Interestingly, they correlate this lack of 2D formation with increased device stability. 2D-forming salt solutions induced a negative work function shift, which they suggest can promote ion migration and decrease stability. Reactivity between 2D and 3D cations Although this factor is among those identified by Kanatzidis and colleagues, it is worth noting that chemical reactions can take place between organic species during solution deposition, and these can influence the formation of 2D perovskite or molecular cation passivation layers. When using amine (rather than ammonium) solutions, ligands react quickly to deprotonate MA +\\ncations in MAPbI 3 , with the formation of PbI 2\\nand reversible reactions forming Pb-iodo-amine/amide complexes 30 . This does not occur in FA-based perovskite as amines tend to react directly with the FA molecule rather than forming coordinate compounds with Pb 31 , 32 . Both of these processes impact 2D formation, as deprotonation of MA +\\nproduces PbI 2\\nto form 2D perovskite when using an MA-based composition, and molecules that cannot form 2D perovskite may form from reactions with FA-based perovskites. Implications for photovoltaic efficiency There are two standard architectures for PSCs: those fabricated in the negative–intrinsic–positive (n–i–p) configuration, in which a hole transport layer is deposited onto the top perovskite surface, and those fabricated in the p–i–n configuration, in which an electron transport layer (ETL) is deposited onto the top perovskite surface. Comparing results from these two architectures is useful to determine how passivation layers facilitate or inhibit hole or electron transport. Fig. 4: Factors driving the formation of a 2D perovskite on top of 3D perovskite. a – f , Six factors that drive the formation of 2D perovskite on top of 3D perovskite include solution concentration ( a ) temperature ( b ), solvent polarity ( c ), perovskite composition ( d ), anion steric hindrance ( e ) and amine reactions ( f ).\\na , Higher concentrations of cation in solution increase the chances of 2D formation.\\nb , Annealing films after cation deposition can lead to the growth of a 2D layer.\\nc , Dissolving cations in polar solvents can dissolve more of the 3D perovskite surface, leading to 2D perovskite formation. P, polarity index.\\nd , All-inorganic perovskites are more resistive to forming 2D perovskite from ammonium cation deposition, probably to due to stronger ionic bonds in the 3D perovskite.\\ne , It has been shown that using large organic anions tends to inhibit the conversion of 3D to 2D perovskite when solution processing.\\nf , It is possible to convert from 3D to 2D perovskite using amines rather than ammonium salts. This occurs through protonation of MA in MA-based perovskite, which acts to displace MA, facilitating the conversion into 2D perovskite. In FA-based perovskite, amines tend to react directly with the FA molecule, which can produce molecules that form 2D perovskite or other species. Full size image Although many papers use fabrication methods, which produce 2D perovskite atop a 3D film, few give conclusive evidence of the conformality of the 2D passivation layer. This is important as to understand the results from these studies we must disambiguate between conformal 2D layers, non-conformal 2D layers, and molecular cation passivation layers. We assessed the results from 50 articles that use ammonium ligand passivation and attempt to characterize the passivation layer, and categorized them as either: (1) molecular cation passivation (information on the conformality of these layers is scarce); (2) no 2D perovskite detected (when an ammonium cation treatment that could form 2D perovskite is used but no decisive evidence is shown to confirm the presence of a 2D structure); (3) 2D perovskite detected (but without conclusive data around its coverage); and (4) conformal 2D/3D heterostructure. Details on the studies taken into consideration are provided in Source Data Fig.\\n5 . To remove ambiguity, we compare devices from groups (1) and (4) only in Fig.\\n5 . The open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of passivated devices was improved by passivation in the majority of reports, which is to be expected. The fill factor was also usually improved, which is reasonable as fill factor tends to increase with increasing\\nV OC . Comparing n–i–p with p–i–n devices, we found that conformal 2D/3D bilayer passivation and molecular cation passivation have a similar effect on n–i–p devices. In contrast, for p–i–n cells, there is a distinct difference in performance, with conformal 2D/3D films performing poorly due to decreases in the current and fill factor. To explain these differences, we must consider how passivation affects surface defects, interfacial trap states and band alignment between perovskite and transport layers.

FF, fill factor. Source data Full size image Surface defects One might reasonably wonder why ammonium ligands passivate so effectively. One suggestion comes from density functional theory calculations 33 . Considering possible defects, FA interstitials and I interstitials have the lowest formation energies, producing trap states within the bandgap. Passivation calculations indicate that ammonium ligands are so effective as they remove A-site vacancies easily (Fig.\\n6a ) and hydrogen bond to remove interstitial defects (Fig.\\n6b ) 34 . Additionally strong surface binding and the bulky nature of 2D cations may act to stabilize these defect sites.

Source data Full size image Without passivation, defects within the bandgap induce non-radiative recombination, thus an obvious indication that a passivation strategy is healing defects is the detection of films with higher photoluminescent quantum yields (PLQYs). The maximum\\nV OC\\nextractable from a solar cell is equal to the quasi-fermi level splitting (QFLS) in the absorber layer. This is related to the PLQY via the Ross relation 35 $${{\\\\rm{QFLS}}}={k}_{{\\\\rm{B}}}T\\\\,\\\\mathrm{ln}\\\\left({{\\\\rm{PLQY}}}\\\\right)+{{\\\\rm{QFLS}}}_{{{\\\\rm{rad}}}},$$ where\\n\\\\({k}_{{\\\\rm{B}}}\\\\)\\nis Boltzmann’s constant,\\nT\\nis temperature and\\n\\\\({QFL}{S}_{{{\\\\rm{rad}}}}\\\\)\\nis the QFLS for the material with no non-radiative recombination. From this, we find that a doubling in PLQY increases QFLS by ~18\\u2009meV (and thus the maximum\\nV OC\\nby ~18\\u2009mV), and increasing PLQY by an order of magnitude increases the maximum\\nV OC\\nby ~60\\u2009mV. As shown in Fig.\\n5 , many papers claim that\\nV OC\\nincreases around or above 60\\u2009mV. If defect healing on the perovskite surface is the sole cause of this\\nV OC\\nincrease, one would expect huge increases in PLQY for neat perovskite films after passivation. Among the data from literature we surveyed (Source Data Fig.\\n5 ), 13 papers report PLQY or QFLS values and these consistently show that QFLS is increased by passivation (as one would expect). However, the QFLS difference between control and passivated films is consistently smaller than the recorded\\nV OC\\ndifference in devices (Fig.\\n6c ). This suggests that although healing perovskite surface defects does contribute to increasing\\nV OC\\nother factors should also be considered. Interfacial traps Beyond defects in each of the individual semiconductor layers of the solar cell stack, it is known that non-radiative recombination is much higher at charge transport layer (CTL)/perovskite interfaces 36 , 37 . PLQY is generally quenched by one to two orders of magnitude using a C 60\\nETL (for example, ref.\\n37 ). From Fig.\\n6c , the differences in QFLS and\\nV OC\\nafter passivation (ΔQFLS and Δ V OC ) are roughly equal for films connected to CTLs, suggesting that a decrease in both surface and interfacial defects explains why ammonium ligand passivation is so beneficial. To understand why either molecular cation passivation or 2D perovskite passivation can inhibit interfacial trap states, we must consider what causes interfacial recombination. Although is is still a subject of research, this phenomenon is usually attributed to cross-interface recombination (minority carriers in the perovskite to majority carriers in the CTL) or the introduction of mid-bandgap interfacial states (Fig.\\n6d ) 28 , 36 , 37 , 38 . Researchers prevent recombination via mid-gap interface states by physically separating the perovskite and CTLs (Fig.\\n6e ) 39 . All of the methods described herein should produce either full or partial separation of perovskite and CTLs to inhibit this. Cross-interface recombination is suppressed by decreasing the minority carrier population in the perovskite near the interface. To achieve this, energetic alignment at the interface must be modulated (Fig.\\n6f ). Energetic alignment Band alignment measurements from films with conformal 2D passivation layers show that these 2D layers tend to align to block electrons and allow holes, and that they shift the perovskite surface to a higher vacuum level (Fig.\\n7a,b ), all of which favour contact with a hole transport layer (as in n–i–p devices) 3 , 4 , 40 . This probably explains the poor performance of p–i–n cells using conformal 2D passivation layers (Fig.\\n5 ). One method to decrease electron blocking is to use a quasi-2D perovskite passivation layer. Quasi-2D perovskites are repeating structures in which multiple units of 3D perovskite are confined by insulating cations (the number of 3D unit cells is defined by\\nn ). They typically have a deeper conduction band minimum than pure ( n \\u2009=\\u20091) 2D perovskite (Fig.\\n7b ). Chen et al. 24\\nand Azmi et al. 41\\nused this concept to produce 2D passivated p–i–n devices with excellent fill factors (>82%); however, it is unclear whether a conformal 2D passivation layer was produced in either work. Indeed, when using a concentration that produced a conformal passivation layer in hyperspectral images (≥1.5\\u2009mg\\u2009ml −1\\noleylammonium iodide in chloroform), Azmi et al. found that PCE decreased slightly. Sidhik et al. used acetonitrile to directly deposit quasi-2D perovskite without dissolving the 3D perovskite substrate. As a result of applying a 55-nm, conformal,\\nn \\u2009=\\u20093, quasi-2D passivation layer to a p–i–n cell, its efficiency decreased by >5 absolute percentage points, suggesting that even quasi-2D passivation layers may be harmful in p–i–n cells.

Full size image Molecular cation passivation layers can also alter surface band alignment. Li et al. 28\\nsuggest that this is mediated by dipole moment. CF3-PEA, for example, has a large dipole moment so it imparts strong charge separation across the perovskite/CTL interface, resulting in perovskite surfaces with deeper band alignment that are more suited to an ETL (Fig.\\n7c ). Using an ammonium ligand with a small dipole moment can result in the opposite, preferred alignment towards a hole transport layer 28 , 42 , 43 . Filling vacancies and surface polishing can also alter surface states for improved alignment 38 , 44 . This explains why molecular cation passivation methods can be effective in both n–i–p and p–i–n configurations. Carrier extraction Passivating agents generally form insulating layers that, if too thick, can impede charge extraction. However, if grown thin enough (~1\\u2009nm), carriers can traverse the layer without the introduction of substantial series resistance. This transport is generally ascribed to tunnelling, although it has been debated whether nanostructured cracks in the insulating layer play a critical role 45 , 46 . Either way, thick (for example, >5\\u2009nm) passivating layers generally limit solar cell performance. For PSCs, many different passivation methods have been developed, most of which employ an extremely thin (around a few nanometres) layer of low conductivity passivant (LiF 47 , MgF 39 , PbSO 4 48 , insulting polymer 49\\nand so on). Conversely, when using conformal 2D perovskite as a passivation layer, layer thicknesses of >50\\u2009nm have shown improved performance 3 , 4 . This suggests that carriers are not traversing the 2D perovskite via tunnelling, but instead the 2D passivation layer is energetically aligned with the perovskite and conductive enough for transport. Quantum confinement in 2D perovskite decreases mobility considerably, particularly for carriers moving between Pb halide units. Within quantum confined units, however, quasi-2D perovskite with\\nn \\u2009≥\\u20093 exhibits mobilities similar to 3D perovskite, thus vertically aligned quasi-2D perovskite films exhibit high current densities (Fig.\\n7e ) 50 . Unfortunately, most 2D passivation layers are reported to form horizontally stacked quantum wells that inhibit transport. Additionally, it is important to note that mixed dimensional phases in quasi-2D perovskite films induce charge trapping in low- n\\nregions (that is, regions with a lower bandgap) within the film, which inhibits charge extraction (Fig.\\n7d ) 51 . Thus, the ideal 2D passivation layer is a pure-phase, quasi-2D perovskite oriented vertically (for vertical charge transport in a device) 52 . Sidhik et al. 4\\nreport that direct deposition of\\nn \\u2009=\\u20093 quasi-2D perovskite produces a pure-phase 2D perovskite passivation layer with mixed horizontal/vertical orientation, allowing diffusion over 100\\u2009nm. One can also remedy poor charge extraction by using non-conformal passivation (like that found in a passivated emitter rear contact cell) 53\\nor an ultra-thin cation passivation layer. The results in Fig.\\n5\\nshow that molecular cation passivation tends to increase fill factor and short-circuit current ( J SC ), suggesting that this as an advantage over 2D passivation layers. Charge extraction in molecular cation passivation layers is influenced by the orbital arrangement of the molecules. This can result in more efficient extraction in molecularly passivated films 28 . An innovative method to overcome poor mobility in 2D passivation layers was developed by Zhu et al. 54 . Using a chiral diammonium ligand treatment ( N , N -dimethyl-1,3-propane diammonium iodide in IPA), they produced 2D perovskite in a metastable structure that decreased quantum confinement, resulting in improved diffusion lengths in\\nn \\u2009=\\u20091 pure 2D perovskite films. When used to passivate a 3D PSC, it is unclear whether their method produced a conformal 2D passivation layer on top of 3D perovskite, but it did result in improved performance against standard surface treatments (PEAI and butylammonium iodide), resulting in a maximum PCE of 24.7%. Ion migration Metal halide perovskites are both electronic and ionic conductors. High defect densities generate high ion densities (up to 10 17 \\u2009cm −3 ) and provide pathways for ion migration 55 . The migration energy of halides is lower than that of cation or metal species 56 , meaning that halide drift is generally attributed to ionic conduction. In PSCs, the built-in electric field induces mobile ions to migrate to the interfaces. This results in a loss of current due to flattening bands at the device interface, or a buildup of insulating interface material 57 . The current density of most perovskite cells is well below the optical limit 58 . Indeed, significant photoluminescence has been observed in cells under short-circuit conditions, meaning that carriers are recombining without being extracted 59 . There is a trend towards higher\\nJ SC\\nafter passivation for most devices in Fig.\\n5 . One explanation for this is lower defect (and thus ion) densities at the perovskite surface, meaning decreased ion screening. Several 2D perovskite and molecular cation passivation layers have been shown to impede ion migration in films 25 , 38 , 60 . Scalability The majority of PSC research uses solution-based deposition by spin-coating thin films; however, this method is not scalable and methods such as blade coating, spray coating or evaporation are preferable at the industrial level. Using an indirect surface passivation method (converting the perovskite surface from 3D to 2D), the reaction time between 2D cations and 3D perovskite must be controlled very precisely, with many reports of dynamic spin-coating 2 , 61 . Considering this, upscaling using a solution-processed method will be difficult, so alternative approaches should be found. For instance, 3D to 2D conversion using scalable vapour deposition has been demonstrated on MAPbI 3\\ncells using butylamine vapour (room temperature) 62\\nand vapourized butylammonium iodide (120\\u2009°C) 63 . 2D passivation with this technique improved the stability of devices regardless of the method used, suggesting that vapour deposition is a valid alternative for scale-up. The PCE of cells was only increased by the room temperature technique, however, which is unsurprising as prolonged processing above 100\\u2009°C is detrimental for MAPbI 3\\nperovskites 64 . Vacuum deposition has been demonstrated, but unfortunately without PCE improvement 65 . Park et al. 20\\ndemonstrated that the processing window for solution exposure is increased when using an ammonium cation that does not form 2D perovskite, meaning that solution processing may be feasible. To this end, Liu et al. 42\\ndemonstrated 26\\u2009cm 2\\nperovskite modules with >21% PCE by utilizing a non-2D-forming diammonium. Implications for solar cell stability 2D perovskite and molecular cation passivation layers often result in improved stability under humid conditions due to the hydrophobic nature of the capping ligands 3 , 41 , 66 . For commercial applications, moisture is less important than other stressors as cells are encapsulated, and encapsulated devices have demonstrated little to no degradation after 1\\u2009year of outdoor operation 67 . More detrimental to performance are illumination and temperature. Both stressors contribute to ion migration, which screens the built-in electric field, causes irreversible degradation of the perovskite layer and decreases electrode conductivity 68 . To prevent this, researchers have inserted barrier layers (indium oxide 69 , SnO 2 70\\nand Cr 71 ), which hinder halide migration. 2D perovskite is known for its lower susceptibility to ion migration than 3D perovskite 72 , and has been shown to decrease ion loss in operating cells 73 . Studies testing molecular cation-passivated perovskite have found similar results 11\\nand passivated cells produce longer operating lifetimes compared with unpassivated cells. To estimate the extent to which passivation extends lifetime, we analysed stability results reported in the literature for encapsulated cells (or those tested under an inert atmosphere) under constant illumination. As each study used a different temperature, we used the Arrhenius factor model from ref.\\n68\\nto equivalate each measurement to 35\\u2009°C. In Fig.\\n8 , we show that non-passivated devices generally exhibit lifetimes of around one month. After passivation, lifetimes typically extend to several months, and in five cases we estimate multiple-year lifetimes 4 , 25 , 74 , 75 . Passivation improves lifetime by between two and 20 times. However, as more emphasis is usually put on demonstrating improved stability compared with controls, this effect may be overestimated. Note that it is unclear whether the films from the 2D detected category contained a conformal or non-conformal 2D perovskite passivation layer, but all of the results are included for completeness. Fig. 8: Estimated\\nT 80\\nlifetimes extrapolated from stability data in literature reports. Only stability data for encapsulated devices (or those tested under an inert atmosphere) under continuous illumination are shown here (full details of the solar cell parameters are reported in Source Data Fig.\\n5 ). The numbers represent reference citations. 2D/3D conformal refers to studies demonstrating the use of a conformal 2D passivation layer 4 , 75 . Molecular cation passivation refers to those showing conclusive evidence that 2D perovskite was not formed 20 , 32 , 43 , 147 , 148 . 2D detected refers to studies in which 2D perovskite was shown to exist on the perovskite surface, but it was either non-conformal or the conformality of the layer was unknown 10 , 25 , 54 , 74 , 119 . The\\nT 80\\nlifetime was estimated using the Arrhenius model used in ref.\\n68 . Source data Full size image Despite impressive results, recent studies have questioned the stability of 2D passivation layers in PSCs. Sutanto et al. 76\\ndemonstrated that over time 2D perovskite can degrade from pure 2D\\nn \\u2009=\\u20091 to\\nn \\u2009≥\\u20092 quasi-2D perovskite, suggesting that ligands continue to penetrate and bisect 3D perovskite units after 2D perovskite crystallization. Devices passivated with ligands that converted more quickly from pure 2D to quasi-2D perovskite showed worse stability under illumination 76 . Using a lower-concentration ammonium ligand treatment (10\\u2009mM compared with 60\\u2009mM), Kamat and coworkers 21\\nshowed that when stressed with illumination and heat, the amount of 2D perovskite present on a film surface decreased over time. Correlating the results at different temperatures, the activation energy for PEA ion migration was calculated to be 36.6\\u2009kJ\\u2009mol −1 —less than half that previously calculated by Kamat’s team for halide migration in bulk 2D perovskite films 77 . Park et al. 20\\nsaw similar results to those of Kamat’s team and used time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry to confirm that PEA ligands move from the surface towards the bulk of the perovskite. Correlating this with PLQY, they found that PEA-treated films had similar 85\\u2009°C stability to a film with no passivation. To avoid losing passivating cations from the perovskite surface, they used anilinium as it cannot produce 2D perovskite and thus cannot readily bisect the perovskite crystal structure. Adding three fluorine atoms to the anilinium molecule increased the strength of binding with the perovskite surface, resulting in improved efficiency (up to 24% PCE for 1.55\\u2009eV perovskite) and stability (our estimate is a\\nT 80\\n(the time required for the cell performance to degrade to 80% of its initial value) of ~2\\u2009years at 1\\u2009sun and 35\\u2009°C; Fig.\\n8 ) 20 . Wang et al. 78\\nnote that the pKa value of most ammonium cation treatments is low relative to that of FA; thus, these cations are more likely to deprotonate, leading to structural degradation and reactions with FA forming ammonia, which can dissolve perovskite. Using (phenethylamino) methaniminium—a cation similar to PEA but with a larger pKa value—to passivate cells improved lifetimes twofold (we estimate a\\nT 80\\nof ~3\\u2009years at 1\\u2009sun and 35\\u2009°C). It is worth highlighting that all-inorganic 2D perovskite (Cs 2 PbI 2 Cl 4 ) can be formed by washing a CsPbI 3\\nfilm with a CsCl solution. Zhao et al. 25\\nused this approach, along with several other barrier layers, to produce ~1.7\\u2009eV PSCs with 17% PCE and a\\nT 80\\nlifetime of 2,100\\u2009h at 110\\u2009°C (estimated to be a\\nT 80\\nof ~5\\u2009years at 35\\u2009°C). The study contained no direct evidence of 2D passivation layer conformality or longevity; however, one might expect all-inorganic 2D passivation layers to be more stable than their hybrid counterparts. The 2D treatment decreased the activation energy for ion migration from 0.29–0.53\\u2009eV and increased lifetimes twofold (Fig.\\n8 ). The approach reported by Sidhik et al. 4\\nwith the direct deposition of a conformal 2D perovskite onto a Cs 0.05 (MA 0.10 FA 0.85 )Pb(I 0.90 Br 0.10 ) 3\\nfilm led to a notable improvement in stability. Using no other barrier layers, their 24.5% PCE n–i–p cells recorded a\\nT 99\\nof 2,000\\u2009h, whereas their control (21% PCE) dropped to 75% of its original efficiency after only 1,000\\u2009h. Interestingly, they also fabricated a cell using a butylammonium iodide treatment in IPA for indirect 2D-to-3D conversion. This cell recorded a\\nT 90\\nof 1,000\\u2009h, considerably worse than the direct 2D deposition film. The reduced stability could have been due to a lack of conformality, meaning that not all of the film surface was protected, or due to similar degradation to that mentioned in the paragraph above, indicating that directly deposited 2D passivation layers may be less susceptible to penetration into bulk perovskite. Conclusion and outlook Whether a passivation technique produces a conformal layer of 2D perovskite, a mixed 2D/organic layer or a non-conformal passivation layer will have an impact on the photophysics and stability of devices. It is difficult, for example, for conformal 2D passivation layers to be used to passivate n-type contacts, and non-conformal passivation layers may insufficiently supress ion drift. However, recent results are encouraging and indicate that, if engineered properly, either molecular passivation layers with low penetration and high binding strength or 2D passivation layers with high stability can improve both the efficiency and stability of solar cells. Deeper understanding of the stability of directly deposited 2D passivation layers is needed. If these passivation layers are more stable because their cations do not ingress into the 3D perovskite, then fabricating 2D passivation layers using bulkier cations than butylammonium may decrease this propensity even more, resulting in even longer lifetimes. Considering efficiency, it may be possible to increase carrier extraction further by depositing a vertically oriented\\nn \\u2009≥\\u20093 2D passivation layer directly; however, this may not afford the same protection to ion diffusion as the protective spacers will not be aligned to block ion movement out of the cell. Aiming to protect the 3D active layer, conformal 2D passivation layers have the advantage of protecting the entire film surface. Molecular cation passivation can theoretically result in a conformal monolayer that protects from ion diffusion without hindering charge transport, but this is difficult to achieve via solution processing. However, if a ligand can be engineered to anchor strongly to the perovskite surface, additional ligands can be washed from the surface without removing the first layer and this could be achieved. It remains to be seen whether a thin molecular passivation layer can afford the same protection as a thicker 2D passivation layer. However, the solar cell lifetime estimates in Fig.\\n8\\nshow that using a molecular cation passivation layer or a conformal 2D passivation layer can afford stability beyond 2\\u2009years under 1\\u2009sun, suggesting that with further progress either passivation layer may ultimately provide enough protection to reach commercially acceptable durability (≥25\\u2009years).\\nChange history 05 August 2024 A Correction to this paper has been published:\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-024-01623-6 References Chen, H. et al.
