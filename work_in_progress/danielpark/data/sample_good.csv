Abstract Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) require both high efficiency and good long-term stability if they are to be commercialized. It is crucial to finely optimize the energy level matching between the perovskites and hole-transporting materials to achieve better performance. Here, we synthesize a fluorene-terminated hole-transporting material with a fine-tuned energy level and a high glass transition temperature to ensure highly efficient and thermally stable PSCs. We use this material to fabricate photovoltaic devices with 23.2% efficiency (under reverse scanning) with a steady-state efficiency of 22.85% for small-area (~0.094 cm 2 ) cells and 21.7% efficiency (under reverse scanning) for large-area (~1 cm 2 ) cells. We also achieve certified efficiencies of 22.6% (small-area cells, ~0.094 cm 2 ) and 20.9% (large-area, ~1 cm 2 ). The resultant device shows better thermal stability than the device with spiro-OMeTAD, maintaining almost 95% of its initial performance for more than 500 h after thermal annealing at 60 °C.

Main Over the past few years, hybrid inorganic–organic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted significant amounts of attention due to their photo-physical properties, the potential for low-cost solution fabrication processing, and their high power conversion efficiency (PCE), which presently exceed 22% 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 . Most highly efficient PSCs utilize an n-type layer of mesoporous TiO 2
and a p-type layer of spiro-OMeTAD (or PTAA) in the n-i-p device configuration, where formamidinium (FA)-cation-based perovskite materials are widely used as light absorbers. We previously reported a mixed perovskite of (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15
via composition engineering to stabilize the ‘black’ phase of the FAPbI 3 -based perovskite with a bandgap of ~1.54 eV from the ‘yellow’ phase of a non-photoactive isomer 7 . Recently, Cs or Rb was incorporated into FA/methylammonium (MA) mixtures to improve the photovoltaic performance and stability of PSCs 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 . For the Rb/Cs/FA/MA-containing perovskite, a high open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 1.24 V at a bandgap ( E g ) of 1.63 eV was obtained to yield a PCE of 21.6%, leading to a loss-in-potential (difference between
V OC
and
E g ) of 0.39 V, comparable to that (~0.4 V) of silicon solar cells 15 . Nevertheless, better performance in PSCs requires greater light harvesting to enhance the photocurrent. Very recently, we prepared a mixed perovskite of (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05
with a bandgap of 1.51 eV and successfully reduced the trap concentration of bulk perovskite film by the addition of triiodide ions (I 3 − ) 9 . This approach to eliminate the deep-level traps responsible for non-radiative recombinations within the bulk perovskite film is crucial for reducing the open-circuit voltage loss. The resultant device exhibited a PCE of 22.1% with a high
V OC
of 1.11 V and a high current density ( J SC ) of 25 mA cm −2 . This current can be nearly identical to the maximum value converted from a light absorber with a bandgap of 1.51 eV into current. In addition, a wide range of attempts to achieve a defect-free perovskite film have been made to date. These include passivating the surface, increasing the grain size, reducing the grain boundaries and adjusting the crystal dimensions of the perovskite film 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 . In addition to perovskite layers, interface-material-dependent losses can also be a determining factor that limits the
V OC
of devices rather than nonradiative bulk recombination losses, even if a defect-less perovskite film is suitably prepared to reach the maximal values of
J SC
and fill factor (FF) beyond the theoretical limits. Thus, for further improvements of device performance capabilities, more efforts to maximize the built-in-potential and enhance
V OC
in PSCs are necessary by utilizing selective charge-transporting materials with a suitable energy level and balanced charge transport efficacy. Recent research systematically studied the relationship between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of hole-transporting materials (HTMs) and the photovoltaic parameters, especially
V OC , for spirobifluorene-based derivatives, fluorene–dithiophene derivatives and tetraphenyl–arylamine derivatives, respectively 20 , 21 , 22 . A higher
V OC
is observed with a higher oxidation potential for HTMs when the driving force for hole injection is satisfactory. However, multiple aspects of HTMs, such as the intrinsic charge mobility, dopant-additive optimization for high conductivity, and specific interaction with the surface of the perovskite can cause complicated effects with regard to the ionization potentials (IPs) of HTMs on the
V OC
values of PSCs. For this reason, the top level of performance from a device utilizing a new HTM has rarely been reported, despite the fact that a tremendous number of HTMs have been developed and applied to PSCs in recent years 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 . Thus, only a few new HTMs can be found to exhibit higher
V OC
and higher PCE values than the best device using spiro-OMeTAD. More importantly, enhanced thermal stability of solar cells is also necessary for the commercialization of PSCs. As reported in the literature, most devices employing spiro-OMeTAD as a HTM are associated with severe degradation against thermal stress because the additives resulted in a significant drop in
T g
of the HTM 31 , 32 . This highlights the need for the development of thermally stable alternative HTMs capable of high-performance outcomes in the presence of additives. In this work, we synthesize a fluorene-terminated HTM ( N 2 , N 2′ , N 7 , N 7′ -tetrakis(9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)- N 2 , N 2′ , N 7 , N 7′ -tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)-9,9′-spirobi[fluorene]-2,2′,7,7′-tetraamine) (which we abbreviate to DM) as a model system with a fine-tuned HOMO level in an effort to enhance the
V OC
value and realize a high glass transition temperature
T g
(~160 °C) for thermally stable PCSs. We also prepare a high-quality film sample consisting of a mixed perovskite based on (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05
which has a grain size of 300~1,000 nm. The DM-based device exhibits a large degree of variation in the PCE according to the amount of additive used. The optimized condition led to a higher PCE owing to the higher
V OC
relative to that of a device made with spiro-OMeTAD. The champion device with DM as a HTM shows a PCE of 23.2% with a
J SC
of 24.9 mA cm −2 , FF equal to 81% and a
V OC
of 1.14 V (under reverse scanning). We achieve a certified PCE of 22.6% from the resultant device. We also show a large device with an aperture area of ~1 cm 2
which reached a PCE of 21.7% (under reverse scanning) and a certified PCE of 20.9%. Furthermore, the device with DM shows good long-term stability for 500 h after annealing at 60 °C, whereas the device with spiro-OMeTAD degraded rapidly after only 50 h. Material characteristics Figure

depicts the chemical structures of spiro-OMeTAD and DM. The synthetic details are given in Supplementary Figs.
1–5 . Though most of the recent development of high-performance HTMs has been mainly focused on the development of new central core structures 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , what determines the physical and optoelectronic properties of the HTMs is the conjugated structure of such core and peripheral units 33 , 34 . The peripheral structure is therefore of equal importance to finely tune the properties of the HTMs. With respect to the molecular design of the HTM, we maintained the well-established spirobifluorene core and introduced a fluorene unit as a new peripheral group instead of
p -anisole for spiro-OMeTAD. DM was simply synthesized via two consecutive Buchwald–Hartwig amination reactions using commercially available 2,2′,7,7′-tetrabromo-9,9′-spirobifluorene,
p -anisidine and 2-bromo-9,9-dimethylfluorene. Fig. 1: Optical, electrochemical and thermal characteristic of HTMs. a , b , Chemical structures of spiro-OMeTAD ( a ) and DM ( b ).

e , DSC curves of spiro-OMeTAD and DM. The vertical dashed lines indicate the glass transition temperature. Full size image Figure
1c
shows the absorption spectra of the HTMs; a slight shift to a longer wavelength with regard to the absorption onset for the DM sample probably stemmed from an extended π-conjugation through the fluorene unit compared to the simple
p -anisole of spiro-OMeTAD. This is supported by the molecular simulation results (see Supplementary Fig.
6 ), which show that the electron density of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of DM is more widely distributed in the fluorene part. An additional electrochemical analysis by cyclic voltammetry (CV) was also conducted, as shown in Fig.
1d . Interestingly, the change of the peripheral unit of the HTM from
p -anisole to dimethylfluorene resulted in a slightly increased oxidation potential. Regarding the HOMO level of spiro-OMeTAD as −5.22 eV, the HOMO level of DM was calculated to be −5.27 eV (ref.  33 ). The LUMO levels of the HTMs were also estimated by combining the HOMO level and the optical bandgap values. Thus, the LUMO levels for DM and spiro-OMeTAD corresponded to −2.36 and −2.24 eV, respectively. Next, Fig.
1e
shows the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms of the DM and spiro-OMeTAD; the
T g
clearly increases for DM, reaching 161 °C, which is nearly 40 °C higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD. The increased
T g
of the HTM is beneficial with regard to the stability of the resultant devices. In addition to the DSC results, the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results also clearly show that the introduction of the fluorene unit into DM improved the thermal stability of the HTM itself (see Supplementary Fig.
7 ). The physical characteristics of DM and spiro-OMeTAD are summarized in Table
1 . Table 1 Optical, electrochemical and thermal properties of spiro-OMeTAD and DM Full size table Photovoltaic performance To evaluate DM as a HTM for PSCs, we fabricated a FAPbI 3 -based PSC based on the typical bilayered device configuration consisting of a fluorine-doped tin-oxide (FTO) substrate/blocking layer bl-TiO 2 /mp-TiO 2 /(FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 /HTM/Au. Following our solvent-engineering process, we prepared a dense and flat perovskite-absorbing layer on the mp-TiO 2
scaffold and subsequently deposited DM on top of the perovskite film via spin-coating. Figure
2a
shows a cross-sectional SEM image of the perovskite film. Grain sizes ranging from 300 to 1,000 nm were observed, together with a dense film morphology and full surface coverage in the absence of voids (see Supplementary Fig.
8 ). The film thickness of the perovskite is in the range 500–600 nm. Thus, the average grain sizes are comparable to the film thickness, which is favourable for charge extraction. That is, the photoinduced charges can move in the out-of-plane direction across the HTM towards the electrode without crossing the grain boundaries. The fabricated film using MACl exhibited two typical perovskite XRD peaks at 14˚ and 28˚, indicating the successful formation of the perovskite based on the composition of (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05
(see Supplementary Fig.
8 ). In contrast, no use of MACl resulted in a poor performance of the device, as reported in our previous literature 7 .

e , Relationship between the power conversion efficiency and the amount of additive added to the DM. The added amount of additives indicates the sum amount of Li-TFSI solution in acetonitrile (340 mg ml −1 ) and pure
t BP with 1:1 volume ratio. Full size image The best-performing cell with a small area of 0.0939 cm 2
exhibited a high PCE of 23.2% ( J SC  = 24.91 mA cm − 2 ,
V OC  = 1.144 V, FF = 81.29%) with slight hysteresis behaviour, as displayed in Fig.
2b . The steady-state PCE corresponded to 22.85% (see Supplementary Fig.
9 ). This device produced a certified PCE of 22.6% owing to the enhanced
V OC
(see Supplementary Fig.
10 ). We also prepared a large-area cell (0.991 cm 2 ), demonstrating a PCE of 21.7% ( J SC  = 24.93 mA cm − 2 ,
V OC  = 1.136 V, FF = 76.68%) and a certified PCE of 20.9 %, as shown in Fig.
2c
and Supplementary Fig.
11 . The statistical distribution of the PCE for small-area devices is shown in Fig.
2d . To the best of our knowledge, the certified PCEs of 20.9% for large cells (1 × 1 cm 2 ) represent the highest efficiency among PSCs reported thus far. Such high efficiencies of PCE are achieved by the careful optimization of the HTL composition. We investigated the effect of different amounts of additives (Li-TFSI and
t BP) on the device performance outcomes with the DM-containing HTL and summarized the corresponding photovoltaic results, as shown in Fig.
2e
and Table
2 . Without additives, or with only small amounts of additives, the PCE of the device is very low because the conductivity of DM is not high enough to transport the injected holes through ~150-nm-thick HTL to the Au electrode, causing severe charge recombination and a very low FF, together with reductions in
J SC
and
V OC . By increasing the amount of the additive to 10 μl, the PCE increases as the FF increases, but past an addition of additives of 14 μl, the efficiency drops abruptly due to the large decreases in FF and
V OC . Such a decrease in the PCE is associated with the morphology of the HTM; with a high amount of additives, many more voids in the film are clearly observed (see Supplementary Fig.
12 ). This is probably the main cause of the migration of the metal into the HTM or the diffusion of the additives into the perovskite layer. By carefully adjusting the amount of additives inside the HTL, we could find the optimization condition that maximized hole extraction in the device. The optimized device exhibited a PCE of 22.3% with a
J SC
value of 24.8 mA cm − 2 , a
V OC
value of 1.11 V and a FF equal to 81%, as shown in Fig.
3a . The statistical distribution of the PCE as displayed in Fig.
2d
revealed high repeatability of the device performance. It also showed that the PCE of the best cell exceeded 23%, as mentioned above.

d , Charge recombination lifetimes of devices with spiro-OMeTAD and DM as measured by the transient photovoltaic method as a function of the bias light intensity. Full size image The device using DM as a HTM showed better performance due to a higher
V OC
as compared to the device using spiro-OMeTAD, as shown in Fig.
3a . With respect to
J SC
and FF, the two devices showed nearly identical values. This outcome is related to the similar order of the mobility for DM and spiro-OMeTAD according to space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements (see Supplementary Fig.
13 ). Time-resolved photoluminescence measurement was carried out to elucidate the dynamics of charge transfer occurring at the perovskite/HTM interfaces. As shown in Supplementary Fig.
14
and Supplementary Table
1 , the pristine perovskite film showed a relatively long PL lifetime of 407.5 ns. In case of HTM-coated perovskite films, PL lifetimes decreased greatly, with values of 31.2 and 16.7 ns for the spiro-OMeTAD and DM-coated film, respectively. In general, a shorter lifetime is attributed to a better charge extraction by a hole-accepting layer contacting the perovskite film. Thus, we consider that DM has a comparable charge-extracting ability to spiro-OMeTAD. In addition, we found that the shunt and the series resistance values are similar in the two devices. It is important to note that we used perovskite films fabricated via an identical process and that both HTMs had comparable charge transport properties with respect to the mobility. The condition under which the additives were added was optimized for each HTM in the PSCs. With respect to the band alignment, the HOMO energy levels of each HTM are given in Fig.
3b , implying that DM has a slightly lower HOMO energy level by 0.05 eV than that of spiro-OMeTAD. From photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, a similar trend was also found in Supplementary Fig.
15 . This may be related to the histogram of the
V OC
distribution shown in Fig.
3c , which clearly indicated that a higher built-in voltage was established when spiro-OMeTAD was replaced with DM. To gain more insight into the recombination behaviour of a full device, we carried out transient photovoltage decay measurements under the open-circuit voltage, as shown in Fig.
3d . As a function of the light intensity, the recombination lifetimes ( τ ) for each device with spiro-OMeTAD and DM are nearly identical. No evidence of any change in the defect states related to the bulk or the interfacial recombinations is likely to be found when the light-absorbing perovskite film comes into contact with the HTM in each case. That is, photogenerated holes can be injected into the HTM without significant interfacial recombinations and travel towards Au with no considerable trapping across the HTM layer that would cause reductions in the
J SC
and FF values. For this reason, both devices exhibited excellent behaviour with regard to
J SC
and FF, as high as ~24.8 mA cm – 2
and ~0.80, respectively. In contrast, the distinguished difference among the photovoltaic parameters was only
V OC , which is the main factor determining the PCE of the device, as shown in Fig.
3c
and Supplementary Fig.
16 . As noted above, this is associated with the replacement of the methoxyphenyl moiety by its dimethylfluorene counterpart, which would weaken the electron-donating power considering the molecular design. Compared to spiro-OMeTAD, the HOMO energy level of DM is closer to the valence band of the perovskite, which can favourably increase the built-in voltage at the junction of the device. In consequence, it is reasonable for DM to have a fine-tuned oxidation potential, leading to better energy-level matching with the perovskite and a higher
V OC
value in the device. As a part of our efforts to realize cost-effective HTM, we also introduced spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] as a recently reported low-cost core into DM, instead of spirobifluorene (see Supplementary Figs.
17–19 ) 24 . The synthesized spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene]-based HTM with a peripheral dimethylfluorene moiety also exhibited a satisfying efficiency of 21.5% (see Supplementary Fig.
20 ). Thermal and operational stability To examine the thermal stability of the device prepared with DM, we investigated the thermal behaviour of a pristine HTM and an additive-doped HTM in a powder state using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in a simulation, as shown in Fig.
1e
and Fig.
4a . The observed
T g
of ~161 °C for the pristine DM powder is considerably reduced to ~90 °C after doping with the additives. This is most likely due to the role of liquid-type
t BP as a plasticizer. A similar trend for spiro-OMeTAD can be found in the literature; doping with an additive into a pristine powder led to a significant drop in
T g
from ~120 to ~50 °C (ref.  32 ). Moreover, it was reported that the
T g
values of organic semiconductors can be reduced in the thin-film state as compared to the bulk state 35 . It is known that deformation of spiro-OMeTAD film arises from crystallization after thermal annealing at a high temperature. For this reason, the device made with additive-doped spiro-OMeTAD exhibited apparent degradation when thermal annealing was applied from 60 °C to 80 °C in air (~25% relative humidity, RH) (Fig.
4b ). In contrast, though slight degradation of the device was observed after thermal stress at 80 °C, the device with DM exhibited much better stability under an identical condition than the device with spiro-OMeTAD. Even after thermal stress at 60 °C for 500 h, the device performance was maintained at ~95% of the original value (see Fig.
4c ). This is good evidence that our strategy of using a HTM with a high
T g
value is feasible in PSCs, even if a higher
T g
value of the HTM is still required for better thermal stability of the device. Furthermore, the encapsulated device using DM is also highly stable, with PCE maintaining 92.6% of its initial value after 310 h under continuous illumination condition (see Fig.
4d
and Supplementary Fig.
21 ). Fig. 4: Thermal and photostability of perovskite cells using DM. a , DSC curves of the DM powder with and without dopants.

J SC
of 24.3 mA cm – 2 , a
V OC
of 1.11 V and a FF of 76.8%, which were measured from
J − V
curves. Full size image In conclusion, we have demonstrated highly efficient and thermally stable PSCs by employing a fluorene-terminated DM that has a HOMO energy level well matched to perovskite along with a high glass transition temperature ( T g ). We fabricated a DM-based device and achieved high PCE values of 23.2% and 21.7% for small- (~0.094 cm 2 ) and large-area (~1 cm 2 ) cells, respectively, due to the significant reduction of the voltage loss of the device. The outcomes here were certified at 22.6% and 20.9% for small- and large-area cells, respectively. Furthermore, the device with DM showed better thermal stability than the device with spiro-OMeTAD, maintaining almost ~95% of its initial performance for more than 500 h after thermal annealing at 60 °C. We firmly believe that our fluorene-terminated DM created via molecular engineering is a promising HTM candidate for the fabrication of highly efficient and thermally stable PSCs and that our strategy in this work will offer a new direction for the fabrication of highly efficient and stable PSCs. Methods Materials For synthesis of DM, tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) was purchased from Strem Chemicals Inc. Tri-tert-butylphosphine was purchased from Kanto Chemical Co. Inc. 2,2′,7,7′-tetrabromo-9,9′-spirobi[9H-fluorene] was purchased from TCI Co. Ltd. 2-bromo-9,9-dimethylfluorene and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. To fabricate the perovskite photoactive layer, formamidine acetate was purchased from Alfa Aesar and lead iodide and lead bromide were purchased from TCI Co. Ltd.

N 2 , N 2′ , N 7 , N 7′ -tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)-9,9′-spirobi[fluorene]-2,2′,7,7′-tetraamine (Compound 1) proceeds as follows. In a 250 ml two-necked flask, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrabromo-9,9′-spirobi[9H-fluorene] (3 g, 4.75 mmol),
p -anisidine (5.85 g, 47.47 mmol), sodium tert-butoxide (3.65 g, 37.97 mmol), tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (1.30 g, 1.42 mmol), tri-tert-butylphosphine (0.58 g, 2.85 mmol) were mixed. Next, anhydrous toluene was added into the flask, and the reaction mixture was heated to reflux at 130 °C for 30 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate and brine water, and dried over anhydrous MgSO 4 .

Device fabrication A dense blocking layer of TiO 2
(bl-TiO 2 ) was deposited onto a FTO (Pilkington, TEC8) substrate by spray pyrolysis deposition carried out using a 20 mM titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution (Sigma-Aldrich) at 450 °C. Subsequently, mesoporous TiO 2
(mp-TiO 2 ) films were spin-coated onto the bl-TiO 2 /FTO substrate using diluted commercial paste (SC-HT040, ShareChem) and were calcined at 500 °C for 1 h in air to remove the organic portion. To fabricate perovskite solar cells based on (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 , the perovskite solution was prepared by dissolving 889 mg ml −1
of FAPbI 3 , 33 mg ml −1
of MAPbBr 3
and 33 mg ml −1
of MACl in DMF/DMSO (8:1 v/v) mixed solvent. Then, the solution was coated onto the mp-TiO 2 / bl -TiO 2 /FTO substrate by two consecutive spin-coating steps, at 1,000 and 5,000 r.p.m. for 5 s and 20 s, respectively. During the second spin-coating (5,000 r.p.m.) step, 1 ml of ethyl ether was poured onto the substrate after 15 s. The intermediate phase substrate was then put on a hot plate at 150 °C for 10 min. For deposition of hole-transport materials, a spiro-OMeTAD solution in chlorobenzene (CB) (90.9 mg ml −1 ) was prepared, and 23 μl of lithium-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI) solution in acetonitrile (ACN) (540 mg ml −1 ) and 39 μl of pure 4- tert -butylpyridine ( t BP) were added in 1.1 ml of the solution. The spiro-OMeTAD solution including additives was spin-coated onto the perovskite surface at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. In the case of DM, a DM solution in CB (28.6 mg ml −1 ) was prepared, and 0–9 μl of Li-TFSI solution in ACN (340 mg ml −1 ) and 0–9 μl of pure
t BP (no dilution) were added in 0.35 ml of the solution. The added volume ratio of Li-TFSI solution and pure
t BP is 1:1. The DM solution including additives was spin-coated onto the perovskite surface at 2,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. Finally, a Au counter electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation. Characterizations and measurements The
J–V
curves were measured using a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Class A, 91195 A) with a source meter (Keithley 2420) at a size of 100 mA cm − 2
under illumination at AM 1.5 G and a calibrated Si-reference cell certified by NREL. The
J − V
curves were measured along the reverse scan direction from 1.5 V to −0.2 V or the forward scan direction from −0.2 V to 1.5 V. The step voltage and scan speed were fixed at 10 mV and 150 mV s −1 , respectively. The
J–V
curves for all devices were measured by metal masks with active areas of 0.0939 cm 2
(small-area device) and 0.991 cm 2
(large-area device) in size. Electrochemical properties of the HTMs were investigated by three-electrode cyclic voltammetry (CV) using a BAS 100B electrochemical analyser. DM or spiro-OMeTAD was dissolved in 0.1 M methylene chloride solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate. Two platinum electrodes were used as working electrode and counter electrode, respectively, and Ag/Ag +
was used as reference electrode. The scanning rate was 50 mV s −1 , and the measured potentials were calibrated using ferrocene as an internal standard. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay profiles were measured at 800 nm with the 532 nm excitation of an OPO laser system (NT 342A-10-AW, EKSPLA). The pulse energy was strongly attenuated to less than 1 μJ, to avoid nonlinear effects such as exciton–exciton annihilation. Emissions from samples were collected by a monochromator (SP2150, Princeton Instruments) equipped with a photomultiplier tube (PMT) (Hamamatsu, H10721-20). The output signal from a PMT was recorded with a 500 MHz digital oscilloscope (DSO-X 3054 A, Agilent). For estimating the valence band maxima of the perovskites and the ionization potentials of the HTMs, photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) measurements were performed using a Riken Keiki AC-2 photoelectron spectrometer in air. SEM images were obtained using a Tescan Mira 3 LMU FEG field-emission scanning electron microscope. The XRD was measured by the Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer using Cu Ka radiation. Transient photovoltage decay measurements were taken using a nanosecond laser (EKSPLA, NT342A-10) as a small perturbation light source and a Xe lamp (Zolix, 150 W) as a bias light source. The device was directly connected to a digital oscilloscope (Agilent, DSO-X 3054 A) with the input impedance of the oscilloscope set to 1 MΩ for an open-circuit condition. The bias light intensity was controlled by a neutral density filter set for various open-circuit voltages ( V oc ) and a strongly attenuated laser pulse of 550 nm was used to generate a voltage transient (Δ V ) of less than 20 mV. Device stability test Thermal stability tests were performed by aging an encapsulated device with increasing temperature (at 60 °C, 70 °C and 80 °C for 50 h, respectively) on a hot plate in ambient air (~25% RH). PCE of the device was periodically measured under AM1.5 G simulated sun light after cooling the device down to room temperature. Long-term thermal stability tests were carried out at 60 °C for 500 h on a hot plate in ambient air, and PCE was periodically recorded under AM1.5 G simulated sun light at room temperature. All of devices for thermal stability test were stored in dark conditions. Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) was also carried out to verify the long-term photostability. The maximum power point of the encapsulated device under AM1.5 G simulated LED light (LSH-7320, Newport, USA) was measured by using a source meter (Keithley 2420, USA) operated by self-written software using a perturb-observe algorithm. The environmental conditions were maintained at a temperature of 25 °C and a relative humidity of 25% RH. The temperature of the devices was maintained between 30 and 40 °C by air cooling. The devices were encapsulated using a getter-dispersed polymer barrier under a nitrogen atmosphere. Finally, those were covered with thermally curable epoxy resin and cover glass.

Abstract Metal halide perovskites of the general formula ABX 3 —where A is a monovalent cation such as caesium, methylammonium or formamidinium; B is divalent lead, tin or germanium; and X is a halide anion—have shown great potential as light harvesters for thin-film photovoltaics 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . Among a large number of compositions investigated, the cubic α-phase of formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI 3 ) has emerged as the most promising semiconductor for highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , and maximizing the performance of this material in such devices is of vital importance for the perovskite research community. Here we introduce an anion engineering concept that uses the pseudo-halide anion formate (HCOO − ) to suppress anion-vacancy defects that are present at grain boundaries and at the surface of the perovskite films and to augment the crystallinity of the films. The resulting solar cell devices attain a power conversion efficiency of 25.6 per cent (certified 25.2 per cent), have long-term operational stability (450 hours) and show intense electroluminescence with external quantum efficiencies of more than 10 per cent. Our findings provide a direct route to eliminate the most abundant and deleterious lattice defects present in metal halide perovskites, providing a facile access to solution-processable films with improved optoelectronic performance.

Reduction of bulk and surface defects in inverted methylammonium- and bromide-free formamidinium perovskite solar cells
Article
03 July 2023
Main Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much attention since their first demonstration in 2009 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . The rapid expansion of research into PSCs has been driven by their low-cost solution processing and attractive optoelectronic properties, including a tunable bandgap 6 , high absorption coefficient 10 , low recombination rate 11
and high mobility of charge carriers 12 . Within a decade, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction PSCs progressed from 3% to a certified value of 25.5% 13 , the highest value obtained for thin-film photovoltaics. Moreover, through the use of additive and interface engineering strategies, the long-term operational stability of PSCs now exceeds 1,000 hours in full sunlight 14 , 15 . PSCs therefore show great promise for deployment as the next generation of photovoltaics. Compositional engineering plays a key part in achieving highly efficient and stable PSCs. In particular, mixtures of methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI 3 ) with formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI 3 ) have been extensively studied 5 , 7 . Compared to MAPbI 3 , FAPbI 3
is thermally more stable and has a bandgap closer to the Shockley–Queisser limit 6 , rendering FAPbI 3
the most attractive perovskite layer for single-junction PSCs. Unfortunately, thin FAPbI 3
films undergo a phase transition from the black α-phase to a photoinactive yellow δ-phase below a temperature of 150 °C. Previous approaches to overcome this problem have included mixing FAPbI 3
with a combination of methylammonium (MA + ), caesium (Cs + ) and bromide (Br − ) ions; however, this comes at the cost of blue-shifted absorbance and phase segregation under operational conditions 7 , 8 , 9 , 16 . Nevertheless, α-FAPbI 3
has recently emerged as the candidate of choice for highly efficient and stable PSCs 9 , 17 , 18 . We have previously prepared α-FAPbI 3
by spin-coating a precursor solution of FAPbI 3
mixed with excess methylammonium chloride (MACl), and achieved a certified efficiency of 23.48% for the resulting mesoporous FAPbI 3
PSC 17 . By fully exploiting the absorption spectrum of FAPbI 3
together with proper light management, a certified efficiency of 23.73% was reported 18 —approaching the theoretical maximum—with a short-circuit current density ( J sc ) of 26.7 mA cm −2 . However, the open-circuit voltage ( V oc ) of around 1.15 V for FAPbI 3
PSCs still lags behind the radiative limit 9 , 18 , which suggests that more work is needed to further reduce the density of defects in the FAPbI 3
perovskite films to suppress the non-radiative recombination of charge carriers. Bromide, chloride (Cl − ) and thiocyanate (SCN − ) anions have commonly been used to improve the crystallinity and stability of perovskite films 8 , 9 , 11 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 . Another pseudo-halide anion, formate (HCOO − ), has also been investigated in connection with MAPbI 3
PSCs 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 . Two studies 23 , 24
reported that MAHCOO improves the quality of MAPbI 3
films by controlling the growth of the perovskite crystals, while others 25 , 26
reported that formic acid accelerates the crystallization of perovskites based on MA cations. Previous work has therefore mainly dealt with the effect of formate on the morphology, nucleation and growth of MAPbI 3 . There has also been a recent report of a highly fluorescent methylammonium lead bromide and formate mixture in water 27 . However, a fundamental understanding of the effects of formate on perovskite films has yet to be achieved. Here we uncover the key role of HCOO −
anions in removing halide vacancies, which are the predominant lattice defects in FAPbI 3
perovskite films. This enables the PCE of the PSC to exceed 25%, combined with a high operational stability and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of electroluminescence (EQE EL ) that exceeds 10%. Iodide vacancies are also the principal cause of the unwanted ionic conductivity of metal halide perovskites, which has deleterious effect on their operational stability. We provide insight into the mode of formate intervention. Formate is small enough to fit into the iodide vacancy 22 , thereby eliminating a prevalent and notorious defect in the metal halide perovskite that accelerates the non-radiative recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, in turn decreasing both the fill factor and the
V oc
of a solar cell. We generated FAPbI 3
perovskite films with improved crystallinity and larger grain size by introducing 2% formamidine formate (FAHCOO) into the precursor solution. The defect passivation and the improved crystallinity are essential to attain the levels of efficiency and stability that are demonstrated by our FAPbI 3 -based PSCs. Characterization of the perovskite films The reference FAPbI 3
film, hereafter denoted ‘reference’, was prepared as previously reported using a precursor solution containing a mixture of FAPbI 3
powder with 35 mol% additional MACl 17 . For the formate-doped FAPbI 3
(Fo-FAPbI 3 ) film,
x
mol% ( x  ≤ 4) FAHCOO was added to the reference precursor solution (for experimental details, see Supplementary Information). At a later stage in this work, we quantify the amount of MA in the resulting perovskite material to be 5%, but for simplicity we refer to this sample as FAPbI 3 . Figure
1a
shows the ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption and photoluminescence spectra of the FAPbI 3
perovskite films ( x
= 0, 2 and 4). The absorption threshold and photoluminescence peak position were identical for all films; however, there was an obvious decrease in absorbance for the 4% Fo-FAPbI 3
film. We derived a bandgap of 1.53 eV for the films using the Tauc plot (Extended Data Fig.
1a ). Fig.
1b
shows the time-resolved photoluminescence of the FAPbI 3
perovskite films. The 2% Fo-FAPbI 3
perovskite film showed a slower photoluminescence decay than the reference, which indicates a reduced non-radiative recombination rate due to a reduction in trap-mediated bulk or surface recombination. By contrast, the 4% Fo-FAPbI 3
perovskite film showed a faster photoluminescence decay than the reference. A full photoluminescence decay up to 4 μs is shown in Extended Data Fig.
1b . A quantitative analysis of the time-resolved photoluminescence is presented in Supplementary Note  1 . Fig. 1: Characterization of the FAPbI 3
films. a , UV–vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the FAPbI 3

f , Two-dimensional grazing-incidence XRD patterns of the reference ( e ) and 2% Fo-FAPbI 3

1c ), the 2% Fo-FAPbI 3
film (Fig.
1d ) had a slightly larger grain size of up to 2 μm (Extended Data Fig.
1c ). The insets of Fig.
1c, d
show the cross-sectional SEM images of the corresponding perovskite films. Both the reference and 2% Fo-FAPbI 3
films showed monolithic grains from the top to the bottom. Extended Data Fig.
1d, e
shows the irregular grain size of the 4% Fo-FAPbI 3
films. Atomic force microscopy measurements (Extended Data Fig.
1f, g ) revealed a surface roughness of 41.66 nm and 57.47 nm for the reference and 2% Fo-FAPbI 3
films, respectively. The slightly increased surface roughness of the 2% Fo-FAPbI 3
film is probably due to the slightly increased grain size. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements (Extended Data Fig.
1h ) showed identical peak positions at around 13.95° and 27.85° for both the reference and the Fo-FAPbI 3
perovskite films, corresponding to the α-phase of FAPbI 3 . However, the XRD pattern of the 4% Fo-FAPbI 3
film showed additional peaks, which are assigned to fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates and different orientations of α-FAPbI 3 . The broader and lower-intensity diffraction peaks—resulting in a higher relative noise level—indicate a poor crystallinity, which is consistent with the poor optical measurements of the 4% Fo-FAPbI 3
film described above. Synchrotron-based two-dimensional grazing-incidence XRD measurements were also obtained for the FAPbI 3
films at a relative humidity of around 100% at 30 °C in air. Figure
1e
clearly shows the presence of the δ-phase in the reference, whereas this phase was absent in the 2% Fo-FAPbI 3
film (Fig.
1f ). This provides strong evidence that FAHCOO stabilizes the α-phase of FAPbI 3
against humidity. In addition, the full-width at half-maximum of the α-phase peak was decreased for the 2% Fo-FAPbI 3
film, which is hereafter denoted as ‘target’. The integrated one-dimensional diffraction intensity is shown in Extended Data Fig.
1i . We infer from these data that including 2% FAHCOO in the synthesis of the FAPbI 3
films strongly enhances their crystallinity. We obtained solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy measurements in order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that lead to the improvements afforded by the HCOO −
anions. We prepared the samples by mixing formamidinium iodide and PbI 2
powders with 5 mol% excess FAHCOO using a mechano-synthesis method. Experimental details are provided in Methods. The
207 Pb spectrum is sensitive to the nature of the anions that are coordinated to Pb 2+
in the perovskite crystal 28 . Figure
2a
shows the
207 Pb NMR spectrum of α-FAPbI 3 , in which the
207 Pb resonance appears at 1,543 ppm. The addition of 5% FABr results in a notable shoulder on the low-frequency side of the resonance, as shown in Fig.
2a
(2). This shoulder corresponds to
207 Pb in a [PbBrI 5 ] site, which resonates at lower frequency than in a [PbI 6 ] site, because
207 Pb in a [PbBr 6 ] site in FAPbBr 3
resonates at 510 ppm 28 . However, the
207 Pb resonance of α-FAPbI 3
remained the same even when 5% FAHCOO was added during the synthesis, which is strong evidence that HCOO −
does not substitute for iodide anions in the α-FAPbI 3
lattice. This is also supported by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the formation energy (Supplementary Note  2 ). Fig. 2: Solid-state NMR spectra and molecular dynamics simulations. a ,

d , The relative interaction strengths of different anions with the I −

anions in the Fo-FAPbI 3
perovskite,
1 H– 13 C cross-polarization experiments
29
were performed at 100 K. Figure
2b
(1) shows
13 C resonance signals at 167.8 ppm and 158.5 ppm for the HCOO −
and FA +
environments in FAHCOO, respectively. Figure
2b , (2) and (3) show the δ-FAPbI 3
and α-FAPbI 3
and
13 C resonances at 157.6 ppm and 153.4 ppm, respectively. Upon mixing 5 mol% FAHCOO with FAPbI 3 , the
13 C signal of α-FAPbI 3
remained unchanged at 153.4 ppm (Fig.
2b
(4)); this further corroborates the lack of substitution of iodide by HCOO −
inside the FAPbI 3
lattice, which would broaden the
13 C resonance of FAPbI 3 . The HCOO −
peak, however, exhibited considerable broadening—indicative of a distribution of local environments—in contrast to the well-defined environment in crystalline FAHCOO. This is consistent with interaction of the HCOO −
anion with undercoordinated Pb 2+
to passivate iodide vacancies that are present at the surface or the grain boundaries of the perovskite, as predicted by molecular dynamics simulations (see below). For the spin-coated target thin films, the formate
13 C signal is less intense, appearing as a shoulder on the α-FAPbI 3
peak (Extended Data Fig.
2a, b ). This is due to a combination of the lower initial formate concentration and—because the exposed area is greater—the potentially greater evaporation of formate during annealing in the thin films compared to that in the powders; however, it should be noted that cross-polarization spectra are not quantitative. The presence of FAHCOO in the α-FAPbI 3
films is also supported by the time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry measurements (Extended Data Fig.
2c, d ). We further quantified the composition of the spin-coated target films using directly detected
13 C NMR at 100 K (Extended Data Fig.
2e ). Integration of the FA +
and MA +
resonances in the quantitative
13 C spectrum yields a concentration of MA +
in the final film of 5.1% (Supplementary Note  3 ). Fig. 3: Characterization of the photovoltaic performance of the FAPbI 3

anions, we performed ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of a homogeneous mixture of different ions in the precursor solution (see Extended Data Fig.
3a, b
and Supplementary Note  4 )—comprising Pb 2+ , I − , HCOO −
and FA + —and found that HCOO −
anions coordinate strongly with Pb 2+
cations (Supplementary Video  1 ). This strong coordination might help to slow the growth process, resulting in larger stacked grains of the perovskite film; this is validated by the in situ images of the perovskite films without annealing (Supplementary Fig.
1 ). Compared to the reference film, the target film showed a slower colour change from brown to black. We also performed molecular dynamics simulations to understand the surface passivation effects of HCOO −
anions. Extended Data Fig.
3c
shows a super cell of a α-FAPbI 3
perovskite slab, in which surface iodides are replaced by formate anions. We found that HCOO −
anions can form a hydrogen-bonded network with FA +
ions (Extended Data Fig.
3d , Supplementary Video  2 ), in agreement with the hydrogen bonding that is observed in FAHCOO crystal structures 30 . In addition, HCOO −
anions can also form a bonding network on the Pb 2+
ion-terminated surface, owing to their strong affinity towards lead (Extended Data Fig.
3e , Supplementary Video  3 ). Figure
2c
shows a calculated structure that illustrates an HCOO −
anion passivating an I −
vacancy at the FAPbI 3
surface. I −
vacancy defects are the most deleterious defects for halide perovskites. They act as electron traps—inducing the non-radiative recombination of charge carriers—and are responsible for the ionic conductivity of perovskites that causes operational instability. We estimated the relative binding affinities of different anions to I −
vacancies at the surface (Extended Data Fig.
4 ).The energies shown in Fig.
2d
reveal that HCOO −
has the highest binding energy to I −
vacant sites in comparison with Cl − , Br − , I −
and BF 4 − . Furthermore, we also calculated the bonding energies of FA +
cations at the interface with HCOO −
anions and with other anions (Extended Data Fig.
5 , Supplementary Note  5 ). We found that FA +
cations at the interface form stronger bonds with HCOO −
than with the other anions. We therefore conclude that the HCOO −
anion acts by eliminating anion-vacancy defects. Photovoltaic performance of the PSCs We further explored the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs. FAPbI 3
PSCs were fabricated using a configuration as illustrated in Fig.
3a . Figure
3b
shows current density ( J )–voltage ( V ) curves of the reference and target PSCs under both forward and reverse scans. The reference cell had a maximum PCE of 23.92% with a
J sc
of 25.72 mA cm −2 , a
V oc
of 1.153 V and a fill factor of 80.69%. The target PSC had a maximum PCE of 25.59% with a
J sc
of 26.35 mA cm −2 , a
V oc
of 1.189 V and a fill factor of 81.7%. The detailed parameters are summarized in Extended Data Table
1 . A statistical distribution of the measured PCE of the reference and target PSCs are shown in Fig.
3c . To verify the efficiency, we sent one of our best target PSCs to an accredited photovoltaic test laboratory (Newport, USA) for certification. Supplementary Fig.
2
represents a certified quasi-steady-state efficiency of 25.21%, with a
V oc
of 1.174 V, a
J sc
of 26.25 mA cm −2
and a fill factor of 81.8%. EQE measurements (Fig.
3d ) were performed to verify the measured
J sc . The EQE of the target cell was higher than that of the reference cell over the whole visible-light absorption region. By integrating the EQE over the AM 1.5G standard spectrum, the projected
J sc
of the reference and target PSCs are 25.75 mA cm −2
and 26.35 mA cm −2 , respectively, which well match the measured
J sc
under the solar simulator. Figure
3e
shows the EQE EL
of the PSCs. It is known that the photovoltage of a solar cell is directly related to the ability to extract its internal luminescence 31 . EQE EL
values have previously been successfully used to predict the
V oc
of PSCs 32 . In this case, the EQE EL
of the reference cell was 2.2%, whereas that of the target cell was 10.1% for injection current densities of 25.5 mA cm −2
and 26.5 mA cm −2
(corresponding to the
J sc
measured under 1 sun illumination), respectively. Treatment with formate therefore results in a fivefold reduction in the non-radiative recombination rate. The
V oc
of 1.21 V that we obtained for the target cell (Extended Data Fig.
6a ) is 96% of the Shockley–Queisser limit of 1.25 V 32 , 33 —to our knowledge, this is the highest value yet obtained. To further confirm the role of formate, we also measured the performance of devices fabricated using formamidinium acetate as an additive (Extended Data Fig.
6b ); however, this additive had a negative effect on performance. For the devices fabricated without MACl additives or passivation layers, those that contained formate still showed an advantage (Extended Data Fig.
6c, d ). Supplementary Fig.
3
shows a linear relationship (with a slope of approximately 0.95) between
J sc
and light intensity for both the reference and target PSCs—indicating good charge transport and negligible bimolecular recombination—and Fig.
3f
shows a linear relationship between
V oc
and the logarithm of light intensity. We fitted the data points with a slope of
η id k B T / q , where
η id
is the ideality factor,
k B
is the Boltzmann constant,
T
is temperature and
q
is the electron charge. The reference cell had an
η id
of 1.52, whereas that of the target cell was 1.18—lower than the previously reported value 33
of 1.27. A summary of the detailed photovoltaic parameters can be found in Extended Data Table
2 . The reduction in
η id , as well as the space-charge-limited current measurements (Supplementary Fig.
4 ), further support our findings of a reduction in trap-assisted recombination 34 , 35 . Because the fill factor critically depends 36
on
η id , the reduction in
η id
that we observe here also contributes to the increase in fill factor measured for the target PSCs. Shelf-life and operational stability of the PSCs To assess the stability of our PSCs, we measured first their shelf life by storing the unencapsulated devices in the dark at 25 °C and 20% relative humidity. Figure
4a
shows that the PCE of the reference cell decreased by about 35% after 1,000 h aging, whereas the target cell showed a degradation of only 10% over this time. A heat-stability test was also performed by annealing the unencapsulated PSC devices at 60 °C under 20% relative humidity. Figure
4b
shows that the target cell retained around 80% of its initial efficiency after 1,000 h aging, whereas the reference cell retained only about 40%. Fig. 4: Stability of the FAPbI3 PSCs. a , The shelf-life stability of the reference and target PSCs.
b , The heat stability of the reference and target PSCs.
c , The operational stability of the reference and target PSCs, showing high performance.
d , The long-term operational stability of the reference and target PSCs. Full size image We further investigated the operational stability of the PSCs by aging the unencapsulated devices under a nitrogen atmosphere, using maximum power point (MPP) tracking under a simulated 1-sun illumination. Figure
4c
shows the PCE of the PSCs under continuous light soaking using a xenon lamp. The PCE of the target cell remained above 24% after 10-h MPP tracking, whereas that of the reference cell decreased to 22.8%. Figure
4d
shows the long-term operational stability of the PSCs. The PCE of the reference cell decreased by about 30%, whereas the target cell only lost around 15% of its initial efficiency. Note that during this experiment the temperature of the PSCs was measured to be around 35 °C, as we did not cool the cells during illumination. Compared to the target PSC, the reference cell showed a considerable decrease in
J sc
and fill factor over the 450-h MPP tracking test (Extended Data Fig.
7 ), which suggests that reference perovskite layer is less stable. We attribute the decline in fill factor to a de-doping of the hole conductor due to Li +
ion migration under illumination 37 . The improvement in thermal and operational stability of the target cell compared with the reference cell is ascribed to the better crystallinity of the perovskite film and a reduced concentration of halide defects, because NMR experiments show that formate is not incorporated into the bulk of the perovskite. It is known that crystallinity is crucial for the stability of the perovskites, because the main degradation process starts from defects near the grain boundaries. The high crystallinity and large grain size of the formate-containing perovskite films—as validated by SEM and XRD measurements—will contribute to their greater stability and performance. Our simulations and calculations suggest that formate anions have the highest binding affinity among all halides and pseudo halides for iodide vacancy sites, and are therefore the best candidates to eliminate the most abundant and deleterious lattice defects present in halide perovskite films. This results in a marked reduction of trap-mediated non-radiative recombination, which we validated by EQE EL , time-resolved photoluminescence,
\(n\) id , and SCLC measurements. A low level of halide vacancies is beneficial for the stability of solar cells, because halide vacancies can lead to degradation as a result of photoinduced iodine loss, especially under light illumination. Overall, we demonstrate α-FAPbI 3 -based PSCs with a PCE of 25.6% (certified 25.2%) and high stability, achieved through solution processing by introducing 2% formamidinium formate into the FAPbI 3
perovskite precursor solution. Our molecular dynamics simulations, together with solid-state NMR spectroscopy analysis and in-depth optoelectronic device characterization, provide an understanding of the role of HCOO −
anions as passivating agents for FAPbI 3
perovskites. Our findings pave the way for facile access to high-performance PSCs approaching their theoretical efficiency limit. Methods Materials Formamidine acetate salt (99%), hydroiodic acid (HI, 57 wt% in water), titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate), 2-propanol (anhydrous, 99.5%), chlorobenzene (anhydrous, 99.8%),
N , N -dimethylformamide (DMF, anhydrous 99.8%,), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, >99.5%), 2-methoxyethanol (anhydrous, 99.8%) and formic acid were procured from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Methylamine hydrochloride (MACl, 98%) was procured from Acros Organics. Fluorine-doped tin oxide on glass (FTO glass, 7 Ω sq –1 ) was obtained from Asahi. Ethanol (absolute, 99.9%) was procured from Changshu Yangyuan Chemicals. Diethyl ether (extra pure grade) was procured from Duksan. TiO 2
paste (SC-HT040) was procured from ShareChem. Lead iodide (PbI 2 , 99.999%) was purchased from TCI. Materials synthesis Formamidinium iodide (FAI) was synthesized as reported elsewhere 8 . In brief, 25 g formamidine acetate was directly mixed with 50 ml hydroiodic acid in a 500 ml round-bottomed flask with vigorous stirring. A light-yellow powder was obtained by evaporating the solvent at 80 °C for 1 h in a vacuum evaporator. The resulting powder was then dissolved in ethanol and precipitated using diethyl ether. This procedure was repeated three times until white powder was obtained, and the white powder was recrystallized from ethanol and diethyl ether in a refrigerator. After recrystallization, the resulting powders were collected and dried at 60 °C for 24 h. As reported previously 18 , black FAPbI 3
powder was synthesized by mixing the synthesized FAI (0.8 M) with PbI 2
(1:1 molar ratio) in 30 ml of 2-methoxyethanol with stirring. The yellow mixed solution was heated with a stirring bar at 120 °C and then recrystallized using the retrograde method. The resulting powder was filtered using a glass filter and baked at 150 °C for 30 min. Formamidine formate (FAHCOO) was synthesized by dissolving formamidine acetate in an excess of formic acid. The resulting solution was dried at 80 °C by rotary evaporation to remove most of the formic acid and acetic acid. A wet formamidine formate powder was obtained. This wet powder was recrystallized with a small amount of ethanol. A transparent, plate-like crystal was formed after the recrystallization, which was consecutively dried in vacuum for 10 h to obtain the final formamidine formate. Bulk perovskite samples for solid-state NMR are prepared by grinding the reactant (FAI and PbI 2
with FABr or FAHCOO as appropriate) in an electric ball (Retsch Ball Mill MM-200) for 30 min at 25 Hz, before annealing at 150 °C for 15 min. Substrate preparation Asahi FTO glass (1.8 mm, 7 Ω sq –1 ) was used as the substrate for the devices. The substrates were cleaned using the RCA-2 (H 2 O 2 -HCl-H 2 O) procedure for 15 min to remove metal-ion impurities. Then, the substrates were cleaned sequentially with acetone, ethanol and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) in an ultrasonic system for 15 min. To deposit the compact TiO 2
(c-TiO 2 ) layer, 60 ml of a titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate)/ethanol (1:10 volume ratio) solution was applied using the spray-pyrolysis method. Prior to the spraying process, the FTO substrates were placed on a hot plate and the temperature was increased to 450 °C rapidly. After the spray pyrolysis step, the substrates were stored at 450 °C for 1 h and then slowly cooled to room temperature. On top of the c-TiO 2
layer, a mesoporous TiO 2
(m-TiO 2 ) layer was deposited by spin-coating a TiO 2
paste dispersed in ethanol/terpineol (78:22 w/w). The TiO 2
nanoparticles have a diameter of approximately 50 nm and were purchased from ShareChem. The FTO/c-TiO 2
substrates prepared with m-TiO 2
were heated at 500 °C on a hot plate for 1 h to remove organic compounds first, and then slowly cooled to 200 °C. Device fabrication For the fabrication of the perovskite layer, the whole process was carried out at controlled room temperature (25 °C) and humidity (20% relative humidity). The reference perovskite precursor solution was prepared by mixing 1,139 mg FAPbI 3
and 35 mol% MACl in a mixture of DMF and DMSO (4:1). For the Fo-FAPbI 3
perovskite film, extra FAHCOO was added to the reference solution in the range of 1–4 mol%. For each sample, 70 μl of the solution was spread over the m-TiO 2
layer at 6,000 rpm for 50 s with 0.1 s ramping. During the spin-coating, 1 ml diethyl ether was dripped after spinning for 10 s. The perovskite film was then dried on a hot plate at 150 °C for 10 min immediately. See Supplementary Video  4
for details of the fabrication of perovskite films. After cooling the perovskite film on the bench, 15 mM of octylammonium iodide dissolved in IPA was spin-coated on top of the perovskite film at 3,000 rpm for 30 s. The hole-transport layer was deposited by spin-coating a Spiro-OMeTAD (Lumtech) solution at 4,000 rpm for 30 s. Details of the Spiro-OMeTAD solution was reported in the previous study 18 . Finally, a gold electrode was deposited on top of the Spiro-OMeTAD layer using a thermal evaporation system. The back and front contacts were formed with 100-nm-thick Au films deposited under a pressure of 10 −6
Torr. Characterization of the solar cells The solar cells without encapsulation were measured with a solar simulator (McScience, K3000 Lab solar cell
I-V
measurement system, Class AAA) in a room with relative humidity below 25% at 25 °C. An anti-reflecting coating layer was used for the devices. The light intensity was calibrated to AM 1.5G (100 mW cm −2 ) using a Si-reference cell certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory before performing measurements. No light soaking was applied before the potential
I – V
scans. All
J–V
curves were measured using a reverse scan (from 1.25 V to 0 V) and a forward scan (from 0 V to 1.25 V) under a constant scan speed of 100 mV s −1 . The stabilized power output was measured at the maximum power point using a xenon lamp light source. A non-reflective mask with an aperture area of 0.0804 cm 2
was used to cover the active area of the device to avoid the artefacts produced by the scattered light (the mask area is determined using a microscope). EQE measurements were obtained using a QEX7 system (PV Measurements). For the EQE EL
measurements, different bias voltages or currents were applied to the PSCs with a BioLogic SP300 potentiostat. The emitted photon flux from the PSCs was recorded using a calibrated, large-area (1 cm 2 ) Si photodiode (Hamamatsu S1227-1010BQ). All measurements were performed in the ambient environment (40% relative humidity, 24 °C). Characterization of the device stability For the stability tests, all PSCs were used without encapsulation. The shelf-life stability was assessed by measuring the photovoltaic performance of PSCs every tens of hours. The thermal stability test was performed by ageing the solar cells on a hot plate at 60 °C at 20% relative humidity. The performance of the devices was periodically measured after cooling the devices to room temperature. The operational stability was performed with a BioLogic potentiostat under an LED or a lamp that was adjusted to AM 1.5G (100 mW cm −2 ). The PSCs were masked and placed inside a homemade sample holder purged with continuous N 2
flow. The devices were aged with a maximum point power tracking routine under continuous illumination. The temperature-control system was not activated during the measurements.
J – V
curves with reverse voltage scans were recorded every 30 min during the whole operational test. Characterization of the perovskite film UV–vis absorption spectra of the perovskite films were recorded on a UV-1800 (Shimadzu) spectrophotometer. The SEM images of the perovskite films were taken with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, S-4800, Hitachi). XRD patterns of the perovskite films were performed using a D8 Advance (Bruker) diffractometer equipped with Cu K α
radiation ( λ  = 0.1542 nm) as the X-ray source. Steady-state photoluminescence and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements of the perovskite films were conducted using a PicoQuant FluoTime 300 (PicoQuant GmbH) equipped with a PDL 820 laser pulse driver. A pulsed laser diode ( λ  = 375 nm, pulse full-width at half-maximum <70 ps, repetition rate 200 kHz–40 MHz) was used to excite the perovskite sample. Surface roughness was assessed using a Cypher S atomic force microscope from Asylum Research under ambient conditions (24 °C, 50% relative humidity). An Olympus AC240-TS tip was used, and the system was operated under tapping mode. Two-dimensional grazing-incidence XRD of the perovskite films was performed at the BL14B1 beamline of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) using X-rays with a wavelength of 0.6887 Å. Two-dimensional grazing-incidence XRD patterns were acquired by a MarCCD mounted vertically at a distance of around 632 mm from the sample with grazing-incidence angles of 0.4° and an exposure time of 30 s. For the time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) measurements, the reference and 2% Fo-FAPbI 3
films were coated on a glass substrate using anti-solvent methods. The samples were analysed by TOF-SIMS using a hybrid IONTOF TOF-SIMS instrument. Depth profiling was accomplished with a three-lens 25-keV BiMn primary ion gun and a Bi 3 +
primary ion-beam cluster (1 pA pulsed beam current). Measurements used a caesium-ion beam for sputtering with an energy of 500 eV (sputtering current 1–23 nA). Profiling was completed with a 100 × 100 μm 2
primary-beam area and a 300 × 300 μm 2
sputter-beam raster. Non-interlaced mode was used to limit beam damage from the primary ion-beam (1 frame, 2 s sputter, 2 s pause). Solid-state NMR measurements Low-temperature (100 K)
1 H– 13 C cross-polarization and directly detected
13 C (125.8 MHz) NMR spectra, and room-temperature
207 Pb (104.7 MHz) NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III 11.7 T spectrometer equipped with a 3.2-mm low-temperature CPMAS probe.
207 Pb and
13 C spectra were referenced to Pb(NO 3 ) 2
at –3,492 ppm and the CH 2
resonance of solid adamantane at 38.48 ppm, respectively, at room temperature. Room temperature
207 Pb spectra were recorded with a Hahn echo and an effective recycle delay of 17 ms. The low-temperature
1 H– 13 C cross-polarization spectra of δ-FAPbI 3
and α-FAPbI 3
were recorded with 1 ms contact time, recycle delays of 1.5 s and 4 s, respectively, and 12 kHz MAS. The low-temperature
1 H– 13 C spectra of FAHCOO and Fo-FAPbI 3
were recorded with 2 ms contact time, 10 s recycle delay and 12 kHz MAS. The quantitative, directly detected
13 C experiment on a scraped 2% Fo-FAPbI 3
film was performed with a single pulse experiment, 12 kHz MAS and a 10 s recycle delay, which is more than 5 times the longitudinal relaxation time of
13 C (1 s). All
13 C spectra were acquired with 100 kHz
1 H decoupling. The low-temperature
1 H– 13 C cross-polarization spectrum of scraped 2% Fo-FAPbI 3
thin-film was measured with 2 ms contact time, 4 s recycle delay and 12 kHz MAS. NMR characterization was performed with 5% Fo-FAPbI 3 , because the greater amount of formate in the sample provides higher sensitivity compared to 2% Fo-FAPbI 3 . MACl was not included in the mechanosynthesized samples for NMR spectroscopy, because this would lead to broadening of the
13 C and
207 Pb resonances of FAPbI 3
(ref.
29 ), owing to different local environments with slightly different chemical shifts that arise from MA +
substitution of nearest-neighbour—and more distant—A-site cations. This broadening would obscure the small changes in the
207 Pb and
13 C resonances that arise from the incorporation of formate. However, given that the incorporation of MA +
ions has a minimal effect on the lattice structure, these findings also apply to the MA + -doped composition studied here.

Materials for energy and catalysis Solar cells
Abstract Three-dimensional/low-dimensional perovskite solar cells afford improved efficiency and stability. The design of low-dimensional capping materials is constrained to tuning the A-site organic cation, as Pb 2+
and Sn 2+
are the only options for the metal cation. Here we unlock access to a library of low-dimensional capping materials with metal cations beyond Pb 2+ /Sn 2+
by processing a full precursor solution containing both metal and ammonium halides. This enables easier synthetic control of the low-dimensional capping layer and greater versatility for low-dimensional interface engineering. We demonstrate that a zero-dimensional zinc-based halogenometallate (PEA 2 ZnX 4 ; PEA = phenethylammonium, X = Cl/I) induces more robust surface passivation and stronger n–N isotype three-dimensional/low-dimensional heterojunctions than its lead-based counterpart. We exhibit p–i–n solar cells with 24.1% efficiency (certified 23.25%). Our cells maintain 94.5% initial efficiency after >1,000 h of operation at the maximum power point. Our findings expand the material library for low-dimensional interface engineering and stabilization of highly efficient three-dimensional/low-dimensional perovskite solar cells.

Main Bi-layered three-dimensional/low-dimensional (3D/LD) perovskite solar cell (PSC) architecture recently emerged as an extremely promising approach to resolve the compromise between photovoltaic performance and operational stability 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 . The superincumbent LD capping layer plays a crucial role not only in surface passivation, but also heterojunction construction and environmental stress resistance 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 . The most common LD capping materials are types of halogenometallate, such as the popular two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden–Popper perovskites with the general formula of A 2 MX 4
(refs.
17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 ), where A is a bulky ammonium cation, M is a metal cation and X is a halide anion. The widely adopted manufacturing process for the LD capping layer is to deposit a bulky ammonium halide such as phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) on top of a 3D perovskite, followed by a cation exchange reaction 14 , 16 , which is known as the half precursor (HP) methodology. The metal cation of the LD capping materials is restricted to Pb 2+ /Sn 2+
and is almost irreplaceable in the current methodology as they are derived from the underlying 3D perovskite. Hence, the most popular strategy in new LD capping materials design is to engineer bulky molecular cations at the A-site 12 , 13 , 16 . Although an interesting solid-state in-plane growth method was recently demonstrated to have good controllability specifically for 2D BA 2 PbI 4
(where BA is butylammonium) on top of 3D perovskites 5 , the intrinsically weak solid-state interaction/reaction and high-pressure (60 MPa) requirements may limit its applicability to LD materials with metal cations that are distinct from the underlying 3D perovskite layer. Tailoring the metal cation of LD capping materials so far remains an open question. Expanding the library of LD capping materials with metal cations different from those in 3D perovskites opens up another exciting lever for engineering the energy levels and optoelectronic properties of the LD interface for high-efficiency 3D/LD PSCs. Herein we developed a full precursor (FP) solution methodology for LD capping layer deposition, where an FP solution containing both the metal halide and bulky ammonium halide—instead of the traditional HP solution containing only the bulky ammonium halide—is directly spin-coated on top of a 3D perovskite. Our approach enables easier synthetic control of the LD capping layer compared with the traditional HP process due to the co-existence of both ammonium halide and metal halide. This ensures that the metal cation reactant is no longer limited by the upward diffusion from the underlying 3D perovskite layer. Importantly, our approach allows unprecedented access to the vast library of metal cations beyond the widespread use of Pb 2+ /Sn 2+
for LD capping materials, thus affording fresh opportunities for optimizing the interface alignment and charge transfer properties for efficient PSCs. We discovered that the zero-dimensional (0D) zinc-based halogenometallate (PEA 2 ZnX 4 ; PEA = phenethylammonium, X = Cl/I) with a β-K 2 SO 4 -type single crystal structure 24
functions as a more effective surface capping material for 3D perovskites. By contrast to the lead-based counterpart, PEA 2 ZnX 4
can induce better surface passivation and stronger n–N isotype heterojunctions, which in turn results in substantial suppression of charge recombination and remarkable enhancement of the built-in potential ( V bi ). Consequently, in combination with a traditional surface passivation molecule tris(2,4-di- tert -butylphenyl) phosphite (TPPi), we achieved one of the highest power-conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 24.1% for p–i–n-structured PSCs with negligible hysteresis; the corresponding certified PCE reached 23.25%. The target PSC also exhibited enhanced stability, retaining 94.5% of the initial PCE after 1,009 h of operation at the maximum power point (MPP) under an equivalent effective irradiance of 1 sun. Our findings pave the way forward to expand the toolkit of LD capping materials with metal cations different from those in 3D perovskites. Our study opens a valuable research avenue for engineering efficient 3D/LD PSCs. Fabrication and characterization of 3D/LD stack films A comparison between the proposed FP and traditional HP processes is shown in Fig.  1a . The solvent of the HP solution is generally prepared using an antisolvent such as isopropanol, whereas a slightly more polar solvent (acetonitrile, ACN) is used to dissolve the FP components, especially the metal halide. Details on the FP process are provided in the
Methods
(Supplementary Video  1 ). For simplicity, we chose PEA 2 PbI 4
and PEA 2 ZnX 4
(X = Cl/I) as representatives of the FP-based LD capping materials, with structures given in Fig.  1b . On the other hand, the ubiquitous PEAI was chosen as a representative for the HP capping method. Notably, the distinguishable characteristic low-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks (Fig.  1c
and Supplementary Fig.  1a ) provide strong and direct evidence for verifying the presence of corresponding LD materials in the 3D/LD films 12 . As a result, the deposited PEA 2 PbI 4
was fully converted into the quasi-2D PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
(where FA is formamidinium) through a reaction with the bottom 3D perovskite of either Rb 0.05 Cs 0.10 FA 0.85 PbI 2.8 Cl 0.2
(abbreviated as Rb 5 Cs 10 ; Fig.  1d
and Supplementary Fig.  1b ) or Cs 0.15 FA 0.85 PbI 2.8 Cl 0.2
(abbreviated as Cs 15 ; Fig.  1e
and Supplementary Fig.  1c ). However, for the conventional capping method, PEAI salt still partially remained on both 3D perovskites under the same post-treatment, although most of it transformed into PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
(Fig.  1d,e ). The superior controllability of our FP technique for growth of the LD overlayer is further confirmed by the successful realization of a 2D (NMA) 2 PbI 4
(where NMA is 1-naphthylmethylammonium) capping layer with superior intrinsic stability 25
on a 3D perovskite (Supplementary Fig.  2 ), which is inaccessible via the traditional HP process due to the difficult reaction between the 1-naphthylmethylammonium iodide salt and the 3D perovskite 26 . Interestingly, we found that both PEA 2 ZnX 4
and PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
phases were detected in the Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 ZnX 4
film (Fig.  1d ), but only PEA 2 ZnX 4
was present in the Cs 15 /PEA 2 ZnX 4
film (Fig.  1e ). It is also noted that halide exchange between I −
in PEA 2 ZnX 4
and Cl −
in either Rb 5 Cs 10
or Cs 15
perovskite always occurs, ultimately leading to a chloride-rich composition of PEA 2 ZnI 4− x Cl x
( x  ≥ 2) (Fig.  1d,e ), where the estimated values of
x
are presented in Supplementary Table  1 . Henceforth, we describe the zinc-based capping component using the simplified formula of PEA 2 ZnX 4
unless specified otherwise, where X is Cl − , I −
or their mixture. Fig. 1: Fabrication diagram of the 3D/LD stack films and structural characterization. a , Comparison of the proposed full precursor (FP) and traditional half precursor (HP) processes for preparing the 3D/LD stack films. ACN, acetonitrile; IPA, isopropanol.

and Rb 5 Cs 10
perovskite, we investigated the RbCl/PEA 2 ZnX 4
stack film under similar conditions and discovered that Rb +
partially exchanged with PEA +
to generate PEAX salt (Supplementary Fig.  3 ). The exchanged Rb +
is probably incorporated into the PEA 2 ZnX 4
structure to form (PEA 1− y Rb y ) 2 ZnX 4 , which is a reasonable deduction as the full-width at half-maximum value for the characteristic diffraction peak of PEA 2 ZnX 4
almost doubled (Supplementary Fig.  3 ), and considering that Rb 2 ZnX 4
has the same β-K 2 SO 4 -type crystal structure as PEA 2 ZnX 4
(refs.
24 , 27 ). Hence we conclude that the PEA 2 ZnX 4
capping layer partially reacted with the Rb 5 Cs 10
perovskite to generate (PEA 1− y Rb y ) 2 ZnX 4
and PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
via the cation exchange between Rb +
and PEA + . The possible reactions between the studied LD capping materials and the 3D perovskites are summarized in Supplementary Table  2 . We further determined the possible conversion ratio of PEA 2 ZnX 4
in the Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 ZnX 4
stack film by means of a rough quantitative XRD analysis (Supplementary Fig.  4
and Supplementary Table  3 ), in which the relative amount of phases present was estimated by using the integral intensity of the corresponding characteristic diffraction peak. Considering the identical preparation and measurement conditions, and similar chemical environments for both Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 ZnX 4
and Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 PbI 4
stack films, it is plausible to assume that the crystallinity and texture of PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
in both stack films are roughly consistent, suggesting that the ratio of PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
in Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 ZnX 4
to that in Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 PbI 4
can be estimated by directly comparing the corresponding integral intensities of the PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
diffraction peak. It is also inferred that the PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
diffraction peak intensity of Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 ZnX 4
should approach that of Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 PbI 4
if PEA 2 ZnX 4
is fully converted into PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7 . This is because PEA 2 PbI 4
shows a complete transformation into PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
in Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 PbI 4 , and the contents of PEA +
in both stack films are probably equivalent due to the same fabrication conditions. Accordingly, a conversion ratio of ~10% of PEA 2 ZnX 4
in Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 ZnX 4
was obtained by simply comparing the PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
diffraction peak intensity of Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 ZnX 4
with that of Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 PbI 4
(Supplementary Table  3 ), indicating that ~90% of PEA 2 ZnX 4
in Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 ZnX 4
was retained. To examine the reliability of the results, a similar analysis was performed to directly calculate the retention ratio of PEA 2 ZnX 4
in Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 ZnX 4
by comparing the PEA 2 ZnX 4
diffraction peak intensity of Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 ZnX 4
with that of Cs 15 /PEA 2 ZnX 4 , which led to a similar retention ratio of ~90% (Supplementary Table  3 ). Meanwhile, ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption spectra of both Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEAI and Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 PbI 4
films based on a relatively thin Rb 5 Cs 10
layer exhibit a clear and strong excitonic absorption peak at ~570 nm corresponding to PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7 , which is barely observed for the Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 ZnX 4
film (Supplementary Fig.  5 ). It can therefore be deduced that PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
is a minor capping by-product in the Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 ZnX 4
film, although it is difficult to directly identify PEA 2 ZnX 4
in the UV–vis spectrum of the Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 ZnX 4
film due to the intrinsic weak absorption of PEA 2 ZnX 4
(Supplementary Fig.  5 ). This is in accordance with the above quantitative XRD analysis results. In summary, the capped PEA 2 ZnX 4
primarily remained on the Rb 5 Cs 10
perovskite, and there is only a slight reaction with Rb 5 Cs 10
perovskite to produce a small amount of PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
by-product. We further assessed the orientation of the LD capping material with respect to the substrate using grazing incidence wide/small angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS/GISAXS) (Fig.  1f , Supplementary Figs.  6 – 10
and Supplementary Note  1 ). The control 3D film exhibits Debye–Scherrer-like rings, and the 3D/LD stack films show additional Bragg spots whose positions correspond with those of the relevant peaks in their XRD patterns. Interestingly, all of the Bragg spots shown in the studied 3D/LD stack films are located along the
Q z
direction, indicating that the LD capping materials are oriented preferentially with the (0 k 0) planes parallel to the substrate (that is, the
b -axis is oriented perpendicular to the substrate). This is consistent with the orientation of most reported LD capping materials prepared via the conventional HP methodology 8 , 10 . The presence and distribution of the zinc-based capping layer on the 3D perovskite surface was further identified using high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) (Supplementary Fig.  11 ), as well as time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS) (Supplementary Fig.  12 ). Furthermore, the zinc-based capping material probably forms a film on 3D perovskite surface, which inferred from its distribution form on the ITO substrate (Supplementary Fig.  13 ). Lattice microstrain analysis (Supplementary Table  4 ) suggests that the zinc-based capping layer hardly induces any additional lattice strain for the bottom 3D perovskite although their crystal structures are different. It is also noted that our FP-based capping solution barely changes the cross-sectional morphology of the underlying 3D perovskite (Supplementary Fig.  14 ), which indicates negligible damage to the underlying 3D perovskite. Furthermore, all of the capping layers are found to effectively reduce the roughness of the 3D perovskite film (Supplementary Fig.  15 ), which is probably attributed to the filling of 3D perovskite surface valley regions by the capping materials. Photovoltaic performance comparison of 3D/LD PSCs We then investigated the p–i–n-structured 3D/LD PSCs with a general configuration of ITO/PTAA/3D/LD/C 60 /BCP/Ag (Fig.  2a ), where ITO is indium tin oxide, PTAA is poly(triarylamine), BCP is bathocuproine and the 3D perovskite is Rb 5 Cs 10
unless specified otherwise. In Fig.
2b–e
and Supplementary Table
5
we compare the open-circuit voltage ( V OC ), short-circuit current density ( J SC ), fill factor and PCE for the control and target PSCs with various capping materials fabricated either via the traditional HP-based process or our FP-based one. The capping layers were prepared using their respective optimum conditions for a fair comparison (Supplementary Table  6 ). Compared with the control device with an average PCE of 19.3% ± 0.3%, both the traditional HP-based 3D/PEAI device and the FP-based 3D/PEA 2 PbI 4
device showed improved performances of 20.5% ± 0.8% and 20.8% ± 0.5%, respectively, whereas the 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
device demonstrated an even greater improvement with a PCE of 22.2% ± 0.3%. These improvements are mainly ascribed to the enhanced
V OC . The comparable performance between the FP-based 3D/PEA 2 PbI 4
and HP-based 3D/PEAI devices is attributed to the similar ultimate capping component (PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7 ). The better reproducibility (narrower PCE distribution) of the FP-based 3D/PEA 2 PbI 4
device is probably due to the superior synthetic control of the LD capping layer by the FP technique. These results validated the feasibility and superiority of our FP technique for efficient 3D/LD PSCs. The outstanding performance of the 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
device advocates the potential advantages of PEA 2 ZnX 4
serving as the LD capping material in 3D/LD PSCs, which is also available in relatively large-area (~1 cm 2 ) devices (Supplementary Table  7 ). We note that the key capping component for the high-performance 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
device should be the intrinsic PEA 2 ZnX 4
and not the PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
by-product because the PEA 2 ZnX 4
residual is the main capping component (accounting for ~90%) in the 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
stack film, as demonstrated above. To eliminate the interference from the small amount of PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
by-product, similar PSCs based on the Cs 15
perovskite were also investigated, considering that PEA 2 ZnX 4
can fully remain on the Cs 15
perovskite, as demonstrated above. Consequently, a similar performance improvement was demonstrated (Supplementary Table  8 ), further confirming the intrinsic superiority of PEA 2 ZnX 4
as the LD capping material in 3D/LD PSCs.

Full size image Optoelectronic properties evolution in 3D/LD PSCs To explicate the underlying reasons for the extraordinary enhancement of device performance by the PEA 2 ZnX 4
capping material, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) analysis was conducted to characterize the non-radiative recombination losses of charge carriers in the perovskite films. In view of similar ultimate capping components and comparable performances for both the HP-based 3D/PEAI and FP-based 3D/PEA 2 PbI 4
devices, the 3D/PEAI stack film was taken as the representative of the lead-based counterpart for comparison. As shown in Fig.  3a , both 3D/PEAI and 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
stack films exhibit long tails in their pseudo-colour TRPL plots relative to the control film under the same excitation fluence of 0.177 µJ cm −2
at 640 nm, indicating longer photoluminescence lifetimes. A more distinct comparison of TRPL decay kinetics is illustrated in Fig.  3b . Fluence-dependent TRPL analysis and corresponding global fits were performed to extract the specific rate constant ( k 1 ) and lifetime ( τ ) for trap-mediated non-radiative recombination, that is, Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination (Supplementary Figs.  17 – 19
and Supplementary Note  2 ). In comparison with the control 3D perovskite, a more substantial decrease of
k 1
and increase of
τ
were observed for 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
compared with a conventional 3D/PEAI (Supplementary Table  9 ), implying the superiority of PEA 2 ZnX 4
over a traditional lead-based counterpart for surface passivation to suppress charge recombination. As demonstrated in most past works 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , the chemical passivation effect of the halogenometallate family of capping materials is mainly rooted in their interactions with the A-site cation vacancy (V A ) and halide vacancy (V X ) defects, which are regarded as the dominant defect types on 3D perovskite surface. Similarly, in our case, both the main surface capping component PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
in the conventional 3D/PEAI film and PEA 2 ZnX 4
in the 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
film enable interactions with the V A
and V X
defects depending on the cationic ammonium group (−NH 3 + ) and halide anion in their structures (Supplementary Fig.  20 ). Although both the PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
and PEA 2 ZnX 4
passivators possess the same passivating groups, their interactions with defects may vary due to different chemical environments and structures leading to discrepant passivation effects. On one hand, the calculated electrostatic potential (ESP) maps of PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
and PEA 2 ZnX 4
showed almost identical ESP for the −NH 3 +
groups in both passivators (Supplementary Fig.  21a,b ), indicating that the passivation effects induced by the −NH 3 +
groups are probably similar for both passivators. We observe a slightly more negative ESP for the halide anion in tetrahedral [ZnI 4 ] than in octahedral [PbI 6 ] (Supplementary Fig.  21c,d ), which is in accordance with the smaller electronegativity of zinc relative to lead. This is conducive to inducing relatively stronger interactions between the halide anion in PEA 2 ZnX 4
and the positively charged V X
defect, and thus contributing to the superior passivation effect. On the other hand, the isolated tetrahedral [ZnI 4 ] structure in 0D PEA 2 ZnX 4
is relatively relaxed compared with the strained connected octahedral [PbI 6 ] structure in the quasi-2D PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
(Supplementary Fig.  22 ), which facilitates effective interactions between passivating groups and the defects. Another possible reason for the superiority of PEA 2 ZnX 4
may be related to modification of interface energy level alignment, which is discussed below. Fig. 3: Comparison of optoelectronic properties. a , Pseudo-colour TRPL plots of the control 3D perovskite, 3D/PEAI and 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4

presents the KPFM images of the control 3D, 3D/PEAI and 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
stack films, with the colour-scale bar representing the contact potential difference (CPD) between the tip and sample surface. As 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
exhibits the highest average CPD value (Fig.  3d ), it implies that PEA 2 ZnX 4
induces a more substantial decrease in the surface work function than the traditional lead-based counterpart. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) analysis was also performed to determine the Fermi levels and valence band maxima of the surfaces of pristine 3D, 3D/PEAI and 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
stack films (Fig.  3e ). It should be noted that the mentioned Fermi levels here are actually quasi-Fermi levels. The conduction band minima were then extrapolated in relation to the optical bandgaps, which were estimated from the UV–vis spectra of pristine 3D perovskite, PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
and PEA 2 ZnICl 3
(Supplementary Fig.  23 ). Note that, in our case, the bandgaps of the surface capping components in the 3D/PEAI and 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
stack films were approximated from those of pristine PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
and PEA 2 ZnICl 3
films. This is because the initially capped PEAI and PEA 2 ZnX 4
will mostly convert into PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
and PEA 2 ZnICl 3 , respectively (Supplementary Table  1 ), after post-treatment, as shown above. As presented in the resulting energy level diagram (Fig.  3f ), all Fermi levels of the 3D perovskite and surface capping components are much closer to their conduction band minima, revealing n-type properties. Furthermore, the Fermi level of the surface capping component in 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
(−3.98 eV) is relatively higher than that in 3D/PEAI (−4.15 eV) and both are effectively enhanced relative to the control 3D perovskite (−4.42 eV), which is in agreement with the KPFM results. Importantly, the specific energy level alignment in either 3D/PEAI or 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
conduced to construct an n–N isotype heterojunction with an additional built-in electric field pointing from the surface to the bulk (Fig.  3f
and Supplementary Note  3 ), which is responsible for enhancement of
V bi
and in turn
V OC
(refs.
28 , 29 ). As the additional
V bi
is dominated by the Fermi level difference at the junction 28 , 29 , 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
can theoretically induce a stronger n–N isotype heterojunction and produce a higher additional
V bi
by virtue of a larger Fermi level difference relative to the conventional 3D/PEAI. The possible
V bi
variation was further investigated by the photosaturation method for the control, 3D/PEAI and 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
PSCs (Supplementary Note  4 ). As predicted, the 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
led to a larger increase of
V bi
compared with the traditional 3D/PEAI (Fig.  3g ), which is consistent with the
V OC
evolution. On the other hand, the specific built-in electric field at the n–N isotype heterojunction probably induces a departure of holes at the 3D perovskite surface, resulting in decreased hole concentration, which is advantageous for reducing the SRH recombination at the surface (Supplementary Fig.  24 ) because the SRH recombination rate is strongly dependent on the surface concentration of the minority carrier 30 . This effect is commonly known in silicon solar cells as field-effect passivation 30 , which has also been reported in PSCs recently 31 . Accordingly, there is probably stronger field-effect passivation in 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
on account of a relatively larger built-in electric field at the corresponding n–N isotype heterojunction, which is also responsible for the superior passivation effect of PEA 2 ZnX 4 . Furthermore, the relatively deeper valence band maximum of the surface capping component can also induce a barrier for holes between the 3D perovskite layer and the C 60
electron transporting layer, which effectively restrains undesired recombination at the perovskite/C 60
interface caused by the adverse band tail states of C 60
(ref.
32
and Supplementary Fig.  25 ). The slightly higher hole barrier in 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
also contributes to greater suppression of charge recombination, thus improving device performance. Device performance and stability of 3D/LD PSCs To further improve device performance, we also introduced TPPi—a traditional surface passivation molecule—to the best-performing 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
PSCs, considering that the relatively rough 3D perovskite surface probably cannot be sufficiently covered by the PEA 2 ZnX 4
capping layer, which has a narrow optimum thickness (~20 nm) (Supplementary Figs.  13 ,
15 ,
16
and
26 , and Supplementary Note  3 ). The chemical structure of the TPPi molecule is presented in Supplementary Fig.  27 , and its passivation efficacy was confirmed by the reduced
k 1
and increased
τ
of the 3D/TPPi film compared with the pristine 3D perovskite film (Supplementary Figs.  17
and
28 , and Supplementary Table  10 ), as well as a slight increase in PCE of the 3D/TPPi PSCs (Supplementary Table  11 ), which has also been demonstrated by other similar molecules 33 . As a result, we obtained a maximum PCE of 24.1% with a
V OC
of 1.198 V, a
J SC
of 24 mA cm −2 , a fill factor of 83.9% and negligible hysteresis (Fig.  4a ). The device also exhibited an average stable power output of 23.5% at the MPP (Supplementary Fig.  29 ) and good reproducibility, with an average PCE of 22.9% over 103 individual cells (Fig.  4b
and Supplementary Table  12 ). The measured
J SC
was validated by the integrated
J SC
from the external quantum efficiency spectrum (Fig.  4c ), with a reasonable relative discrepancy of less than 2%. Our PSCs were also evaluated by an independent national institute, Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS), which offers a high-precision solar simulator with an almost ideal spectral mismatch factor of 1.01 for our PSCs. A certified PCE of 23.25% was obtained (Supplementary Fig.  30 ). Fig. 4: Device performance and stability. a , Current density–voltage ( J – V ) curves of the champion 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4

e ,
J – V
curves of the target PSC before and after MPP tracking for 1,009 h. Source data Full size image Finally, we examined the operational stability of the 3D/LD PSCs based on our FP technology. The operational stability tests were performed at the MPP in a N 2 -filled glovebox (O 2  < 10 ppm, H 2 O < 1 ppm) under illumination of a white light-emitting diode (LED) lamp with an equivalent effective irradiance of 1 sun. It is noted that the Cs 15
3D perovskite and the hybrid LD capping layer of PEA 2 PbI 4 −PEA 2 ZnX 4
were included in the PSCs for the stability tests, considering that a comparable device performance was achieved for the 3D/PEA 2 PbI 4 –PEA 2 ZnX 4
PSC relative to the 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
PSC (Supplementary Table  13 ), which is due to the intrinsic superiority of PEA 2 ZnX 4 , as demonstrated above. Consequently, 94.5% of the initial PCE was maintained after 1,009 h of MPP operation for the target PSC, which is remarkably enhanced compared with the control PSC (Fig.  4d,e ). To reveal the possible reasons for the stability improvement induced by the LD capping layer, we investigated the surface morphology and defects evolution of the relevant perovskite films after aging them under 1 sun illumination in air without encapsulation. As illustrated in Supplementary Figs.  31
and
32 , the LD capping layer effectively inhibited the generation of surface pinholes on the 3D perovskite film, which probably results from the blocking of H 2 O/O 2
penetration/erosion by the hydrophobic organic bulky cations within the structure of the LD capping layer (Supplementary Figs.  33
and
34 ) 16 . Moreover, a relatively larger decrease in surface photoluminescence intensity for the control 3D perovskite film was also observed (Supplementary Fig.  35 ), indicating that the LD capping layer is probably favourable for suppressing light-induced production of surface defects due to the robust interaction between the LD capping material and the 3D perovskite surface (Supplementary Fig.  33 ). To further verify the role of the LD capping layer in device stability improvement, we also performed the 85 °C heat stability tests for the PSCs under ambient conditions or in N 2
(see
Methods ). As predicted, the target 3D/LD device also showed enhanced heat stability compared with the control 3D device (Supplementary Fig.  36 ). Conclusion Using a full precursor solution methodology in 3D/LD PSCs, we have paved the way forward to expand the toolkit of LD capping materials to include metal cations different from those in 3D perovskites. Compared with the conventional lead-based counterpart, 0D PEA 2 ZnX 4
functions as a more effective LD capping material for 3D perovskites because it induces more robust surface passivation and forms a stronger n–N isotype heterojunction. The resulting 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
PSCs achieved a remarkably improved PCE of 24.1% (certified 23.25%) and enhanced operational stability. Although only the representative PEA 2 PbI 4
and PEA 2 ZnX 4
are presented here in detail, our FP technology also showed broad applicability for other commonly studied LD capping materials such as BA 2 PbI 4
and PMA 2 PbI 4
(where PMA is phenylmethylammonium) (Supplementary Table  14 ), as well as BA 2 ZnX 4
(Supplementary Fig.  37
and Supplementary Table  15 ). Aside from the Zn 2+
cation, our FP technology could potentially unlock access to many other divalent metal cations such as Co 2+
(PEA 2 CoX 4 ) (Supplementary Fig.  38
and Supplementary Table  14 ), Mn 2+ , Cu 2+
and so on, as well as trivalent cations such as Sb 3+ , Bi 3+ , Al 3+
and so on, which are promising for tuning energy level alignments at 3D/LD interfaces and/or enhancing the interface stability more effectively. We therefore believe our findings will unlock new opportunities to develop superior LD capping materials from the vast family of halogenometallates, especially the lead-free ones, for more efficient and stable PSCs as well as impact other perovskite optoelectronics such as LEDs, lasers, photodetectors and so on.

HP and FP capping solution preparation The conventional HP capping solution was prepared by dissolving PEAI in IPA according to ref.
34 . The PEA 2 PbI 4
FP capping solution was prepared by dissolving 31.3 mg PbI 2
and 33.9 mg PEAI in 4 ml ACN (17 mM). The other FP capping solution including BA 2 PbI 4 , PMA 2 PbI 4 , (NMA) 2 PbI 4 , BA 2 ZnX 4
(X = Cl/I), PEA 2 ZnX 4
(X = Cl/I) and PEA 2 CoX 4
(X = Cl/I) was prepared in the same way, with an identical concentration of 17 mM. Note that the mixed solvent with 50 µl methylamine solution in 1 ml ACN was specially used to dissolve the (NMA) 2 PbI 4
precursors. The PEA 2 PbI 4 −PEA 2 ZnX 4
hybrid FP capping solution was prepared by dissolving 62.7 mg PbI 2 , 18.5 mg ZnCl 2
and 135.5 mg PEAI in 8 ml ACN. Device fabrication The patterned ITO-coated glass substrates were ultrasonically cleaned in the following sequence: first with aqueous detergent, followed by deionized water, then acetone and lastly ethyl alcohol for about 20 min in each step; after which the substrates underwent ultraviolet ozone treatment for 15 min before use. All of the spin-coating processes were conducted in a N 2 -filled glovebox (O 2  < 10 ppm, H 2 O < 1 ppm). The hole-transporting PTAA layer was deposited by spin-coating the PTAA solution (2 mg ml −1
in toluene) on cleaned ITO substrates at a speed of 2,000 r.p.m. for 60 s, and then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The Rb 0.05 Cs 0.10 FA 0.85 PbI 2.8 Cl 0.2
(Rb 5 Cs 10 ) perovskite precursor contains 414.9 mg PbI 2 , 27.8 mg PbCl 2 , 146.2 mg FAI, 26.0 mg CsI and 10.6 mg RbI in 1 ml anhydrous DMF:DMSO (4:1, v/v). The Cs 0.15 FA 0.85 PbI 2.8 Cl 0.2
(Cs 15 ) perovskite precursor contains 414.9 mg PbI 2 , 27.8 mg PbCl 2 , 146.2 mg FAI, 39.0 mg CsI in 1 ml anhydrous DMF:DMSO (4:1, v/v). The Cs 0.05 (MA 0.15 FA 0.85 ) 0.95 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45
(CsMAFA) perovskite precursor contains 780.3 mg PbI 2 , 112.9 mg PbBr 2 , 277.8 mg FAI, 26.0 mg CsI and 31.9 mg methylammonium bromide in 2 ml anhydrous DMF:DMSO (4:1, v/v). The Rb 5 Cs 10 , Cs 15
and CsMAFA perovskite films were deposited by spin-coating the corresponding precursor solution on the ITO/PTAA substrates at 1,000 r.p.m. for 10 s (5 s ramp) and 4,000 r.p.m. for 45 s (1 s ramp); 150 µl of 1,2-dichlorobenzene was rapidly dropped on the substrates at 10 s before the end of the programme to induce fast crystallization of perovskites. The as-prepared perovskite films were then annealed at 110 °C for 10 min. Next, the HP or FP capping solution was spin-coated on top of the perovskite films at a speed of 5,000 r.p.m. (1,500 r.p.m. was used for XRD and GIWAXS/GISAXS samples for better signals) for 30 s. Note that the FP capping solution should be rapidly injected onto the 3D perovskite surface after the substrate starts spinning to minimize the possible erosion of the underlying 3D perovskite (Supplementary Video  1 ). The films were then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The additional TPPi passivation layer was prepared by spin-coating the TPPi toluene solution (6 mg ml −1 ) at a speed of 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s as required. Finally, 50 nm C 60 , 6 nm BCP and 100 nm silver were thermally evaporated (under a vacuum <5.0 × 10 −4  Pa) in sequence on the films through a metal shadow mask with an active area of 6 mm 2
for small-area devices or 1.218 cm 2
for large-area devices. To minimize reflections and possible edge effects, a 100 nm LiF layer was evaporated onto the glass side of ITO substrates as an anti-reflection layer, and a non-reflective black metal aperture mask with an aperture area around 4 mm 2
for small-area devices or 0.973 cm 2
for large-area devices was also affixed on the glass side of ITO substrates as required. The silver electrode was replaced with the chromium/gold (5 nm/100 nm) electrode in the PSCs for the stability tests. Device characterization The
J − V
curves of the PSCs were recorded with a Keithley 2400 source meter under simulated air mass 1.5 G solar illumination from a ScienceTech UHE-NSC AAA solar simulator. The effective irradiance of the solar simulator for the studied PSCs was adjusted to 1 sun (100 mW cm −2 ) according to our previous method by using an Oriel PV Reference Cell System (91150 V) with calibration of possible spectral mismatch 35 . The
J − V
curves were measured in either a forward or reverse scan direction from −0.2 V to 1.25 V/1.20 V or 1.25 V/1.20 V to −0.2 V at a scan rate of ~0.5 V s −1 . The presented
J − V
curves were obtained in the reverse scan direction at room temperature in a N 2 -filled glovebox (O 2  < 10 ppm, H 2 O < 1 ppm) unless specified otherwise. Note that the
J − V
curves were initially measured without an aperture mask. The measured
J SC
was then calibrated against the value obtained with aperture mask by subtracting the obtained
J SC
difference between the measurements without and with aperture mask in our specific photovoltaic system, although the
J SC
difference was as small as 0.37 mA cm −2
caused by the unaccounted reflections and possible edge effects 36
(Supplementary Table  16 ). The final presented
J − V
curves were obtained from the measurement with an aperture mask or based on the calibrated
J SC
accordingly. The spectral response and external quantum efficiency analysis was performed on a Zolix Solar Cell Scan100 measurement system (Zolix Instruments Company) and QEPVSI-b set-up (Newport). Other characteristics The XRD patterns were measured using a PANalytical X’Pert Pro X-ray diffractometer (copper Kα,
λ  = 1.5418 Å, 40 kV, 30 mA) (PANalytical). All of the GIWAXS/GISAXS patterns were acquired by using the Nano-inXider system of Xenocs. It should be noted that the Nano-inXider of Xenocs can only provide GIWAXS/GISAXS information at different
Ψ
angles between the X-ray beam and sample, rather than the whole pattern. The wavelength of incident X-rays was 1.54189 Å. The incident angle of the X-ray beam was 0.3°. The UV–vis absorption spectra were measured utilizing a Shimadzu UV3600PLUS UV–vis-NIR spectrophotometer. The planar and cross-sectional SEM images were taken on a JEOL JSM-7600F microscope. The atomic force microscopy images were taken on a Bruker Bioscope Resolve system. The sample lamella for TEM measurements was prepared by a focused ion beam (FIB)–SEM system (ZEISS Crossbeam 540). A layer of carbon with a thickness of around 1.3 µm was deposited on top of the sample for protection before the lamella was prepared using the FIB. The first 300 nm of carbon film was deposited using 30 kV and a current of 100 pA; the subsequent 1 µm was deposited using 30 kV and 300 pA. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy images and EDX maps of multiple layers were collected using an aberration-corrected JEOL JEM-ARM200F TEM operated at 200 keV with an Oxford X-Max TLE 100 mm 2
windowless silicon drift detector EDX. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy analysis was performed on a Kratos AXIS Supra spectrometer equipped with a standard helium-discharge lamp with He I photons (21.22 eV). Kelvin probe force microscopy analysis was performed on a Cypher ES Environmental Scanning Probe Microscope (Asylum Research/Oxford Instrument) by using a conductive antimony-doped silicon probe coated with Pt/Ir (SCM-PIT-V2, Bruker), with a resonant frequency of 75 kHz and force constant of 3 N m −1 ; the measurements were performed in the amplitude modulation mode at a lift height of 200 nm above the sample surface, with a typical scan rate of 1.5 Hz. The KPFM samples were deposited on ITO substrates and grounded to the metallic sample holder with conductive silver paint. Note that the three samples compared (control 3D, 3D/PEAI and 3D/PEA 2 ZnX 4
stack films) were loaded together on the same sample holder; the measurements were performed under the same conditions. It is therefore reasonable to attribute the measured CPD variation between samples to different intrinsic surface properties but not due to other factors. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements were conducted using an Optronis Optoscope streak camera system, with the sample excited by 640 nm femtosecond laser pulses at various fluences, which were generated from a Coherent Libra femtosecond laser system (50 fs, 1 kHz, 800 nm) and a Coherent OPerA Solo optical parametric amplifier. Note that all of the TRPL samples were excited at the sample surface side. The photoluminescence images were recorded using a Nikon Ti2-E Inverted Motorized Microscope system (×20 objective lens) with the sample excited by a 473 nm continuous wave laser and the photoluminescence signals collected by a photomultiplier tube. The TOF-SIMS analysis was performed on a TOF.SIMS 5 (IONTOF) system with detection of positive secondary ions. Water contact angle analysis was performed on a Dataphysics OCA 15 Contact Angle Goniometer. Operational stability test The operational stability test for the studied PSCs was conducted in a N 2 -filled glovebox (O 2  < 10 ppm, H 2 O < 1 ppm) at the MPP under illumination of a white LED lamp with an equivalent effective irradiance of 1 sun. An example of the detailed tracking process is as follows and the involved data are shown in Supplementary Table  17 . First, the initial PCE of the PSC was measured under the simulated air mass 1.5 G AAA solar simulator with an effective irradiance of 1 sun as described above. The obtained initial PCE and
J SC
were labelled as PCE (0h,SS)
and
J SC(0h,SS)
(where SS denotes solar simulator). Second, the PSC was then subjected to the operational test under the white LED lamp irradiation. The effective irradiance of the white LED lamp for the specific PSC was identified as 1 sun when the measured
J SC
(labelled as
J SC(0h,LED) ) was adjusted to approximate the
J SC(0h,SS)
in the first step. A certain voltage bias was then selected and applied to the PSC to generate MPP output by a Keithley 2602B source meter. The PSC was left to continuously operate under this MPP for around 22 h. Third, after the first 22 h of MPP operation, the
J SC
was measured again under the white LED lamp and labelled as
J SC(22h,LED) . The
J SC
was also measured for the same device under solar simulator irradiation and labelled as
J SC(22h,SS) . Note that the possible difference between
J SC(22h,LED)
and
J SC(22h,SS)
may be caused by the irradiance change of the white LED lamp after 22 h of operation but not due to the device performance change between the two measurements, because both
J SC(22h,LED)
and
J SC(22h,SS)
were measured at the same time. The negligible difference between
J SC(22h,LED)
and
J SC(22h,SS)
indicated the relatively stable irradiance of our white LED lamp. Fourth, the longer operational tests were similarly conducted by repeating steps two and three. Note that the presented operational stability results were based on the PCE data measured under the solar simulator irradiation. Heat stability test The 85 °C heat stability test was conducted under ambient conditions (relative humidity ≈ 50%) or in a N 2 -filled glovebox (O 2  < 10 ppm, H 2 O < 1 ppm). A simple basic encapsulation is made for the device before the start of the test in air, and there is no encapsulation for the device tested in N 2 . The simple basic encapsulation was achieved by directly storing the original device in a small commercial air-tight box, which was then put into an 85 °C oven for the test. It should be noted that the simple basic encapsulation is unable to completely prevent exposure to air. The widely used triple-cation CsMAFA 3D perovskite was used in the relevant device for the test. DFT calculations The ESP maps of PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
and PEA 2 ZnI 4 —based on their single crystal structures—are calculated using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package 37 . We use the all-electron-like projector augmented-wave method 38 , and the PW86R exchange 39
and PBE correlation 40
potential as implemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package code. The semi-core of lead atoms (5 d
orbital) is treated as valence electrons, that is, 14 valence electrons for a lead (5 d 10 6 s 2 6 p 2 ) atom. The cut-off energy for the plane wave expansion of the wave functions is 500 eV. The lattice constants of PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
and PEA 2 ZnI 4
are listed in Supplementary Table  18 . All atoms in the unit cell are fully optimized. The Hellman–Feynman forces are smaller than 1 meV Å −1 . The 4 × 4 × 1 and 4 × 1 × 3 Monkhorst-Pack grid of k-points 41
for Brillouin zone integration of PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7
and PEA 2 ZnI 4 , respectively, are employed in the DFT calculations. The vdW-DF2 (ref.
39 ) method is used to calculate the van der Waals interaction. The related ESP maps are generated using the Visualization for Electronic and Structural Analysis software (Version 3, retrieved from

Energy Energy harvesting Solar cells Solar energy and photovoltaic technology
Abstract Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are an emerging photovoltaic technology with the potential to disrupt the mature silicon solar cell market. Great improvements in device performance over the past few years, thanks to the development of fabrication protocols 1 , 2 , 3 , chemical compositions 4 , 5
and phase stabilization methods 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , have made PSCs one of the most efficient and low-cost solution-processable photovoltaic technologies. However, the light-harvesting performance of these devices is still limited by excessive charge carrier recombination. Despite much effort, the performance of the best-performing PSCs is capped by relatively low fill factors and high open-circuit voltage deficits (the radiative open-circuit voltage limit minus the high open-circuit voltage) 11 . Improvements in charge carrier management, which is closely tied to the fill factor and the open-circuit voltage, thus provide a path towards increasing the device performance of PSCs, and reaching their theoretical efficiency limit 12 . Here we report a holistic approach to improving the performance of PSCs through enhanced charge carrier management. First, we develop an electron transport layer with an ideal film coverage, thickness and composition by tuning the chemical bath deposition of tin dioxide (SnO 2 ). Second, we decouple the passivation strategy between the bulk and the interface, leading to improved properties, while minimizing the bandgap penalty. In forward bias, our devices exhibit an electroluminescence external quantum efficiency of up to 17.2 per cent and an electroluminescence energy conversion efficiency of up to 21.6 per cent. As solar cells, they achieve a certified power conversion efficiency of 25.2 per cent, corresponding to 80.5 per cent of the thermodynamic limit of its bandgap.

Main SnO 2 -based electron transport layers (ETLs) offer favourable band alignment, while being processable at low temperature 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 . Of the various deposition methods, SnO 2
nanoparticle-based ETLs have demonstrated the best performances thus far. However, SnO 2
nanoparticle-based PSCs exhibit relatively low electroluminescence external quantum efficiency (EQE) values, and hence higher open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) deficits (defined as the radiative
V OC
limit minus the high
V OC ), compared to TiO 2 -based PSCs 8 , in spite of efforts to eliminate non-radiative recombination pathways 19 . The electroluminescence EQE of a photovoltaic device, determined by measuring the luminescence efficiency under forward bias, is a direct measure of the radiative efficiency of carrier recombination. The electroluminescence EQE can be used to quantify the non-radiative contribution to the
V OC
deficit via the reciprocity theorem, and is a useful metric for solar cell characterization 11 , 20 . Thus, it is crucial to develop strategies that minimize photovoltage losses at the ETL/perovskite interface so as to minimize the
V OC
deficit, encouraging the search for a different deposition method that can develop the full potential of SnO 2
ETLs. The ideal SnO 2
ETL will generate a high photovoltage and fill factor by having complete and conformal coverage without pinholes, an ideal band alignment to efficiently extract electrons while blocking hole back-transfer, a low defect density to prevent detrimental interface recombinations, and will also be thin enough to promote efficient charge extraction 21 . As a part of our holistic approach, we first report a facile method of chemically tuning the physical and electronic properties of the SnO 2
ETL via chemical bath deposition. Chemical bath deposition enables uniform and complete coverage of the underlying substrate by depositing a dense and conformal layer 22 , 23 . However, a lack of understanding of the complex chemical reactions during SnO 2
chemical bath deposition has prevented the fabrication of highly efficient PSCs. We infer that the Sn intermediate species during chemical bath deposition play a crucial part in the quality and the characteristics of the final SnO 2
layer. More specifically, we suggest that the formation of various Sn intermediate species depends on the decomposition pathway of the Sn 2+
precursor (SnCl 2 ), which depends on the pH of the reaction solution 24 , 25 , 26 . Synthesis and characterization of SnO 2
Freshly prepared chemical bath deposition solutions exhibit pH <1 and the pH increases with longer reaction time as urea decomposes and releases OH –
(Supplementary Fig.
1 ). We divide the changes in the thin film properties of the SnO 2
layer with reaction time into two main stages as shown in Fig.
1 . Stage A shows the growth of SnO 2
layer with planar morphologies. Within stage A, stage A-i at early reaction times is the most acidic (pH 1), followed by stage A-ii (pH 1.5) and stage A-iii (pH 3). Stage B is the final stage of the reaction with a distinct morphology of interconnected nanorods and has the highest pH of 6.

shows scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the SnO 2
layer deposited on top of a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-covered glass via chemical bath deposition. The top-right insets are magnified top-down SEM images, highlighting the roughness and surface morphology of the film, with the SnO 2
layer more clearly seen on top of a pyramid-shaped FTO domain. The insets on the bottom-right are cross-section transmission electron microscope (TEM) images. In the early stage of the reaction (stage A-i), which is when the pH of the reaction solution is still approximately 1, the SnO 2
layer is about 20 nm thick, conformal with the underlying FTO layer. With increasing reaction time, and thus an increase in the pH of the reaction solution, the size of the SnO 2
domain increases while forming a densely packed layer with thicknesses ranging from around 50 nm to around 100 nm (Fig.
1b, c ). When the reaction reaches stage B, the SnO 2
begins to grow into elongated rod-like morphologies (Fig.
1d ). The high-resolution TEM shown in Fig.
1b
(stage A-ii) shows a SnO 2
layer forming complete coverage with interconnected domains, even down to the sharp valleys within the FTO layer (Fig.
1e ). The conformal and complete SnO 2
coverage is further confirmed by cyclic voltammetry, which shows that the films have robust hole-blocking capabilities when reacted past stage A-ii, or pH 1.5 (Supplementary Fig.
2 ), whereas stage A-i SnO 2
is inefficient at hole blocking. The lattice fringes in Fig.
1f
indicate that individual domains have high crystallinity, where the lattice fringes correspond to the (110) and (101) planes of rutile SnO 2 , with the fast Fourier transform pattern of the TEM image shown in the inset to Fig. 1f.The films prepared while still under acidic conditions (stages A-i, A-ii and A-iii) have a pure phase, whereas films prepared by allowing the reaction solution to reach stage B contain secondary phases, such as Sn 6 O 4 (OH) 4
and SnO (Fig.
1g ). SnO 2
synthesis mechanism From the experimental results, we classify the reaction progress into four parts (Fig.
1h ). At the beginning of the reaction (stages A-i and A-ii, pH = 1−1.5), the dominant product of the chemical bath deposition reaction is SnO 2.
As the reaction progresses to stage A-iii, owing to a sharp decrease in oxygen dissolved in the reaction solution, incomplete oxidation of Sn 2+
to Sn 4+
is highly likely (Supplementary Fig.
3 ). This leads to dominant production of SnO 2– x , 0< x <2
(ref.
24 ). In addition, the chemical bath deposition solution turns murky around this reaction stage, owing to the formation of insoluble amorphous tin oxide species (inset in Fig.
1h ) 24 . When the reaction reaches stage B, oxygen-deficient SnO 2– x
is joined by Sn 6 O 4 (OH) 4
and SnO, which are produced as secondary phases (red precipitate shown in the inset), as observed from the X-ray diffraction data (Fig.
1g
and Supplementary Fig.
4 ). We propose a synthesis mechanism during the chemical bath deposition growth of SnO 2
in Fig.
1i . In stage A, the Sn 2+
ions dissolved in strong acidic aqueous solution undergo a hydrolysis reaction, and form Sn(OH) +
intermediate species. Sn(OH) +
is then oxidized to Sn 4+
by the dissolved oxygen in the solution 24 . The Sn 4+
ions then react with OH -
ions, provided by the decomposition of urea, to form Sn(OH) 4
species, which are converted to SnO 2
via a dehydration reaction (top branch in Fig.
1i ) 24 , 27 . However, Sn 2+
ions from Sn(OH) +
can then be readily incorporated into the SnO 2
lattice owing to the comparable ionic radii of Sn 2+
(0.62 Å) and Sn 4+
(0.69 Å) for hexa-coordinated Sn species (middle branch in Fig.
1i ) 28 , 29 , 30 . The incorporation of Sn 2+
into the SnO 2
lattice leads to the formation of oxygen vacancies in the SnO 2
layer to preserve charge neutrality. This leads to nonstoichiometric SnO 2– x , which is synthesized in stage A-iii, as a result of a sharp decrease in oxygen dissolved in the reaction solution. When the reaction reaches stage B, a different Sn intermediate species, Sn 3 (OH) 4 2+ , forms in the reaction 25 , 31 . The Sn 3 (OH) 4 2+
intermediate species can undergo a condensation reaction when the pH is sufficiently high, resulting in Sn 6 O 4 (OH) 4
(refs.
25 , 26 , 32 ). The Sn 6 O 4 (OH) 4
is then partially transformed to SnO via a dehydration reaction, producing a mixture of Sn 6 O 4 (OH) 4
and SnO (bottom branch in Fig.
1i ), consistent with the X-ray diffraction results 26 , 33 . SnO 2
ETL-based PSCs We fabricated a series of PSCs up to different stages for the growth of the SnO 2
layer to evaluate device performance (Fig.
2 ). PSCs with stage A-i SnO 2
show an average efficiency of about 20% with a relatively wide power conversion efficiency (PCE) distribution (Fig.
2a ). A noticeable improvement in device performance is observed for stage A-ii SnO 2 , where the PCE exceeds 24%, with the greatest improvements in
V OC
and fill factor (Supplementary Fig.
5 ). These devices show a stabilized power output of up to 24.5% with a certified quasi-steady state PCE up to 24.2% (Fig.
2b
and Supplementary Figs.
6 − 9 ). We attribute this substantial advancement in device performance to complete and conformal coverage of the SnO 2
layer, which prevents interfacial recombination. In contrast, when the reaction reaches stage A-iii, we observe a noticeable drop in device performance, with the greatest contribution from lower fill factor and
V OC
values despite complete film coverage and no detectable non-SnO 2
phases. To understand this device result, we performed time-resolved photoluminescence and transient photovoltage measurements to probe the interaction between the SnO 2
layers (stages A-ii and A-iii) and the perovskite active layer carefully (Fig.
2c, d ). Fig. 2: Solar cell performance of PSCs based on various SnO 2
ETLs. a , PCE statistics represented in box-and-whisker plots (centre line, average; box limit, standard deviation; whiskers, outliers) for PSCs based on SnO 2

c , Time-resolved photoluminescence traces for perovskite thin film deposited on stage A-ii SnO 2
(red trace) or stage A-iii SnO 2
(orange trace). The average lifetime for the stage A-ii sample and the A-iii sample is 984 ns and 81 ns, respectively. The reduced carrier lifetime for the stage A-iii SnO 2
sample indicates heavy non-radiative recombination at the interface, whereas a favourable interface is achieved for the stage A-ii SnO 2
sample.
d , Transient photovoltage traces for stage A-ii SnO 2 - and stage A-iii SnO 2 -based perovskite solar cells. The decay time, determined as the time it takes to each 1/e intensity, for stages A-ii and A-iii is 37.8 μs and 17.9 μs, respectively. The longer decay time for the A-ii SnO 2 -based device further suggests reduced non-radiative recombination at the interface.
e , Schematic illustration of the progress of the reaction highlighting stage A-ii as the ‘magic region’, which exhibits ideal film coverage, morphology and chemical composition . Full size image Defects within a solar cell act as a carrier trap sites where the energy is lost through non-radiative recombination pathways. Thus, an ideal solar cell should be free from such trap sites. We performed time-resolved photoluminescence measurements because detrimental interfacial trap states lead to reduced carrier lifetimes. The time-resolved photoluminescence results show a much shorter carrier lifetime for stage A-iii SnO 2
than for stage A-ii samples, indicating an increase in non-radiative interfacial recombination between SnO 2
and perovskite, and thus leading to lower photovoltage and fill factor. From transient photovoltage measurements, we confirmed much longer decay times in stage A-ii devices than in stage A-iii PSCs, which further indicates reduced non-radiative pathways for stage A-ii SnO 2 -based devices. Inferior device performance for stage A-iii SnO 2
devices is the result of reduced carrier lifetime, where the increase in defects in the SnO 2
layer is responsible for an increase in non-radiative recombination pathways. In metal oxide thin films, oxygen vacancies act as site defects; their negative effects are especially important in films composed of tiny domains with high surface areas, such as in our SnO 2
films synthesized via chemical bath deposition. Both X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet−visible absorption spectroscopy suggest higher concentrations of defects for stage A-iii SnO 2 , as a form of oxygen vacancy, shown by the shift of the Sn 3 d 5/2
state towards lower binding energy (Supplementary Fig.
10a ) 28 , 30 , 34 , 35 , 36 , gradual increase in absorptivity in the ultraviolet−blue wavelength range (Supplementary Fig.
10b ), and higher Raman signal (Supplementary Fig.
11 ). The uncontrolled formation of defects in stage A-iii SnO 2
films not only increases charge recombination at the SnO 2 /perovskite interface, but also limits electron transport through SnO 2
nanodomains (Supplementary Fig.
12 ). On the other hand, the suppressed formation of surface defects for stage A-ii SnO 2
films is critical for realizing high fill factor and a low
V OC
deficit, along with appropriate surface coverage (Supplementary Fig.
13 ). In addition, the ETL needs to have a deep relative valence band in order to efficiently prevent hole quenching at the ETL/perovskite interface. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy shows that the deepest valence band is achieved during stage A-ii (Supplementary Fig.
14 ). This further supports the reduction of charge recombination in the device and thus the high efficiency observed for PSCs fabricated using stage A-ii SnO 2
(ref.
37 ). Lastly, the PSCs with stage B SnO 2
show the lowest PCE, probably owing to the formation of non-SnO 2– x
phases, such as Sn 6 O 4 (OH) 4
and SnO, which are not electron-transporting, along with overproduction of oxygen vacancies in the SnO 2
layer. The overall understanding of the chemistry during the synthesis of SnO 2
via chemical bath deposition is illustrated in Fig.
2e
(see Methods for a detailed discussion). Effect of the MAPbBr 3
additive In addition to engineering the physical and electrical properties of the ETL, further improvements in PSC performance can be achieved by improving the optoelectronic properties of the perovskite active layer. An ideal active layer should present a high absorption profile to maximize carrier generation with long carrier lifetimes and mobilities for efficient carrier collection. This requires developing strategies to improve crystal grain size and carrier lifetime, while preventing the formation of detrimental traps at the bulk and interfaces. Notably, improving the efficiency of PSCs requires the decoupling of the passivation strategies for the bulk and the interface because the type and concentration of defects affect them differently. In the second part of our holistic approach, we show that only a trace amount of methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr 3 ) (<1 mol%) is needed to stabilize the perovskite active layer, with the benefit of improved optoelectronic properties. Figure
3
shows the characterization of perovskite thin films passivated with a two-dimensional perovskite, with the bulk perovskite fabricated with the addition of various amounts of MAPbBr 3 . An increase in grain size with decreasing amounts of MAPbBr 3
is clear in the SEM images of Fig.
3a . The correlation suggests that MAPbBr 3
arrests perovskite grain growth, probably owing to the slow diffusion of the large bromide anion 38
in a perovskite thin film fabricated with methylammonium chloride (MACl) additives, where MACl has been reported to promote perovskite crystal grain growth. Fig. 3: Characterization of perovskite thin films varying the mole per cent of MAPbBr 3

are obtained from a mono-exponential fit.
e , Effective mobility for perovskite thin films determined from optical pump−terahertz probe measurements (error bars show one standard deviation). Full size image In addition to changes in grain size and morphology, the absorption onset and the photoluminescence peak redshifts are consistent with decreased incorporation of MAPbBr 3
into the perovskite crystal as lower amounts of MAPbBr 3
are added (Fig.
3b ). Notably, X-ray diffraction analysis shows successful passivation of the perovskite active layer from the detrimental formamidinium lead iodide (δ-FAPbI 3 ) phase with a MAPbBr 3
concentration as low as 0.8 mol% (Fig.
3c ) 39 , 40 . Such a low concentration is in contrast to the commonly used range of 7−20 mol%, which was established through processes that passivate both the bulk and the interface in one step. We believe stabilization of the intermediate phase, before thermal annealing, is responsible for successful stabilization of α-FAPbI 3
even at such a low MAPbBr 3
concentration (Supplementary Figs.
15 ,
16 ). The two-dimensional perovskite passivation we used is thus shown to be effective in stabilizing the interface, which is prone to the formation of defects and the unfavourable δ-phase 8 , 41 . Carrier lifetimes can be determined through fitting the time-resolved photoluminescence decays to a mono-exponential function (Fig.
3d ). Films with MAPbBr 3
added below 2.5 mol% show substantially longer carrier lifetimes than the 10 mol% sample, with the longest carrier lifetime observed in the 0.8 mol% sample (>3.6 μs). Carrier lifetimes in the microsecond range suggest that there are few non-radiative pathways and such long carrier lifetimes can lead to high
V OC . We attribute the long carrier lifetimes to a combination of increased perovskite crystal grain size and successful passivation using the two-dimensional perovskite. Detrimental halide segregation, which is suspected to form carrier trap sites, is likely to be reduced at low MAPbBr 3
concentrations and this may also contribute to the increased carrier lifetimes 8 , 42 . Carrier dynamics can be obtained using optical pump−terahertz probe spectroscopy, measuring transient photoconductivity (–Δ T / T ) at different carrier densities (Fig.
3e
and Supplementary Fig.
17 ). With an increase in fluence, and thus an increase in carrier density, the –Δ T / T
increases and the decay trace develops a fast component corresponding to increasing higher-order recombinations. An effective mobility can be calculated from the recombination dynamics measured by optical pump−terahertz probe measurements 43 . Figure
3e
plots effective mobilities as a function of the mole per cent added MAPbBr 3 . Interestingly, the effective mobility increases from 0 mol% to 2.5 mol% (26.8 cm 2  V –1  s –1
to 31.2 cm 2  V –1  s –1 ), before dropping down to 25.9 cm 2  V –1  s –1
for 10 mol%. Indeed, as we have observed for grain sizes (Fig.
3a ) and carrier lifetimes (Fig.
3d ), this low-concentration region can yield large changes in morphologies and carrier dynamics, which correlate with effective mobility. It is also possible that the perovskite crystal orientation, which is known to influence effective mobilities 44 , and homogenization of halides may also be affected at low concentrations of added MAPbBr 3 . Thus, through separately passivating the bulk (with extremely low amounts of MAPbBr 3 ) and the interface (with two-dimensional perovskite passivation 8 ), highly efficient PSCs can be fabricated by substantially reducing the MAPbBr 3
concentration, with the added benefit of reducing the bandgap penalty. Solar cell and electroluminescence performance PSCs were fabricated by combining our newly developed SnO 2
ETL and the improved perovskite layer described above. These PSCs show an average PCE of 24.7%, with some devices exceeding a PCE of 25%, when measured in-house (blue data points, Fig.
4a ). The best performing devices were sent to the solar cell device testing facility in Newport, USA, for certification with the test results shown as the red data points in Fig.
4a . The best-performing device achieved a certified PCE of 25.2% from a quasi-steady-state measurement, with PCEs determined from the current−voltage ( J−V ) sweep to be 25.3% and 25.4% for the reverse and forward sweep, respectively (Fig.
4b
and Supplementary Figs.
18 − 21 ) 45 . In addition, the certified device showed almost no change in PCE during up to 3,600 h of storage (Supplementary Fig.
22 ). Additionally, the encapsulated device retained about 80% of its initial PCE after 500 h under continuous light illumination at maximum power point (100 mW cm −2 , AM1.5G, 45 °C), without an ultraviolet cut filter (Supplementary Fig.
23 ). We also fabricated PSCs with larger areas; our best-performing large-area cell (0.984 cm 2 ) exhibits PCEs up to 23.0% with a high
V OC
value of 1,196 mV (Fig.
4c ). Fig. 4: Device result for best-performing PSCs with 0.8 mol% MAPbBr 3 . a , Statistical distribution represented in box-and-whisker plots (centre line: average, box limit: standard deviation, whiskers: outliers) for best-performing PSCs (0.0937 cm 2

The blue points show the PCE values measured in-house and the red points show the PCE values measured at Newport for certification purposes.

curves of a larger-area PSC exhibiting a PCE up to 23%. The active area is 0.984 cm 2 , defined by a mask aperture. The inset is a photograph, where the dotted outlines approximate the mask aperture.
d , Electroluminescence EQE and ECE values of our PSC under forward bias. Their maximum values are given. The inset shows the device (left photograph) with visible red emission upon voltage bias (right photograph). Full size image The bandgap of this record cell,
E g  = 1.56 eV, was determined from the inflection point of the EQE curve (Supplementary Fig.
24 ) 11 . This bandgap corresponds to a thermodynamic PCE upper limit of 31.3%. At 25.2% PCE, our best-performing certified cell is thus at 80.5% of the theoretical efficiency limit, which is comparable to the best Si solar cells, which are at 80.9% of the theoretical limit 46 . We attribute the high PCEs of our cells to major improvements in the
V OC
and the fill factor. The radiative
V OC
limit
V OC rad
is calculated to be 1.270 V and the
V OC
measured without an aperture mask reaches 1.225 V (Supplementary Fig.
25 ) 6 , 11 , 47 , resulting in a ratio of
V OC
to the radiative
V OC
limit of up to 96.5%, which is the highest reported thus far for a PSC, and is within striking distance of that for GaAs (97.7%). Such a low
V OC
deficit suggests that almost all non-radiative recombination pathways have been efficiently eliminated and that these PSCs should be highly luminescent when operated as a light-emitting diode, as we find below. Figure
4d
shows a plot of the electroluminescence EQE and energy conversion efficiency (ECE) values versus voltage of a PSC measured under forward bias (the current−luminance−voltage curve is provided in Supplementary Fig.
26 ). We observe an electroluminescence EQE of up to 17.2%, which approaches the efficiency of the best-performing perovskite light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which are engineered specifically for efficient light emission 48 , 49 , 50 . In addition, due to early sub-bandgap turn-on, probably from thermal carriers, our PSCs exhibit a peak electroluminescence ECE of up to 21.6%. In addition to extremely low
V OC
loss and high luminescence efficiency, our devices exhibit a high fill factor of up to 84.8%. Such a high fill factor is a result of improved carrier mobility in the perovskite active layer and better charge collection with the SnO 2
ETL developed here with minimum parasitic losses from shunt and series resistances. For a further improvement in fill factor, future research should be focused on minimizing trap-assisted recombination, aiming to approach the theoretical fill factor limit of about 90%.

Abstract The energy landscape of reduced-dimensional perovskites (RDPs) can be tailored by adjusting their layer width ( n ). Recently, two/three-dimensional (2D/3D) heterostructures containing
n  = 1 and 2 RDPs have produced perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with >25% power conversion efficiency (PCE). Unfortunately, this method does not translate to inverted PSCs due to electron blocking at the 2D/3D interface. Here we report a method to increase the layer width of RDPs in 2D/3D heterostructures to address this problem. We discover that bulkier organics form 2D heterostructures more slowly, resulting in wider RDPs; and that small modifications to ligand design induce preferential growth of
n  ≥ 3 RDPs. Leveraging these insights, we developed efficient inverted PSCs (with a certified quasi-steady-state PCE of 23.91%). Unencapsulated devices operate at room temperature and around 50% relative humidity for over 1,000 h without loss of PCE; and, when subjected to ISOS-L3 accelerated ageing, encapsulated devices retain 92% of initial PCE after 500 h.

Main Reduced-dimensional perovskites are perovskite quantum well (QW) layers confined between large organic ligands. The number of stacked lead (Pb) octahedra between the organic spacers determines the width of the RDP layer:
n  = 1, 2, 3 and so on (Fig.
1a ). Changing the RDP layer width ( n ) within bulk RDP films alters the energy landscape of the resulting material, hence narrow RDP films ( n  ≤ 5) produce excellent light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and luminescent solar concentrators 1 , 2 . Although films containing wider RDPs ( n  ≥ 10) have been used to produce highly stable PSCs, these devices suffer from an inferior performance due to poor carrier mobility 3 , 4 . More recently, record-performing PSCs have used a 2D/3D heterostructure, fabricated via spin coating RDP (or 2D) ligands onto the surface of a 3D perovskite 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 . A comparison of PSC efficiency/stability from recent reports is shown in Supplementary Fig.
1
and demonstrates that all of the most efficient devices reported have used this structure. Studies have revealed that this heterostructure consists of a thin layer of
n  = 1 and/or
n  = 2 RDPs atop a bulk 3D perovskite 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , which increases performance via passivation and increased electron blocking 17 , 18 . Electron blocking is beneficial for devices built in the negative–intrinsic–positive (NIP) architecture, in which the 2D-treated perovskite surface is coated with a hole transport layer (HTL); however, when used in the generally more stable 19 , 20 , 21 , 22
inverted (that is, positive–intrinsic–negative, or PIN) structure, this strategy achieves mixed results. Chen et al. found that a 2D treatment applied to inverted cells improved the open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) but reduced the fill factor (FF) 23 , and Bai et al. found that introducing a small amount of 2D ligand into the antisolvent improved the device performance, opening the door to further study of the width of RDPs and indeed their presence 24 . On the other hand, Park et al., La-Placa et al. and Zhao et al. all found that using a 2D layer in a PIN device reduced the PCE due to a lower current and fill factor 25 , 26 , 27 . We speculated that reducing the confinement in the 2D layer could reduce electron blocking and produce inverted PSCs with an exceptional performance.

1b ) and compared them with the bulk 3D perovskite Cs 0.05 MA 0.1 FA 0.85 PbI 3
(MA, methylammonium; FA, formamidinium). Consistent with earlier reports, we found little dependence between the valence band maximum (VBM) and
n
(RDP width) 18 , 28 , 29 . Instead, quantum confinement upshifts the conduction band minimum (CBM), which induces electron blocking in the devices. We confirmed this detrimental effect by comparing NIP and PIN PSCs treated using standard 2D treatments (Supplementary Text
1 ). Encouragingly, simulations using the solar cell simulation tool SCAPS-1D 30
suggested that, due to their deeper CBM, a capping layer of
n  ≥ 3 RDPs would be beneficial for PIN solar cell performance via surface passivation with reduced resistance to carrier transport (Supplementary Text
2 ). In bulk RDP films, the average layer thickness is modulated by changing the ratio of the 2D ligands to the 3D perovskite precursors in solution 1 , 4 . We explored several options to reproduce this for a 2D post-treatment (Supplementary Text
3 ). Our most distinctive results came from introducing a small amount of dimethylformamide (DMF) (at 1:200 by volume in isopropanol (IPA)) and methylammonium iodide (MAI) (1:2 by weight) to the 2D ligands in solution. We posit that MAI is needed to reduce the ratio of the 2D ligand to the A-site cation and that DMF introduces Pb directly from the 3D perovskite surface (Supplementary Fig.
9 ). Using this strategy, we were able to produce 2D perovskite capping layers containing
n  ≥ 3 RDP layers (Fig.
1e ). For convenience, we henceforth refer to our altered 2D ligand treatment as a quasi-2D treatment. Notably, Zhou et al. demonstrated that adding MAI and DMF to a phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) surface treatment improves the performance of PIN solar cells 31 . This earlier study is limited in scope, however, discussing only the effect of DMF on the penetration depth of the 2D treatment. Using time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry, we estimated the penetration depth of phenethylammonium (PEA) from solutions using different DMF concentrations (Supplementary Fig.
11 ) and found no correlation in our sample size (from 1:200 to 1:50 DMF:IPA by volume). We instead expect that the origin of improved performance is the production of wider RDPs at the interface between the 3D perovskite and the electron transporting layer (ETL). Considering this new observation, we sought a treatment that would optimize this effect. Characterizing the quantum well width in 2D/3D heterojunctions A strong dependence between QW width and bandgap exists in 2D perovskites 32 , 33 . Hence, ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy is able to accurately identify the distribution of different 2D species in perovskite films 34 , 35 , 36 . We first acquired the TA spectra of 2D- and quasi-2D-treated films using the most common 2D perovskite ligands: butylammonium (BTA) (Fig.
2a,d ) and PEA (Fig.
2b,e ). Although the majority absorption from each film is from the 3D perovskite (780 nm, Supplementary Fig.
12 ), each film displays bleach peaks in the 500–700 nm range, characteristic of RDPs. Similar to spectra acquired by Niu et al., the standard 2D-treated films display bleach signals from
n  = 1 and/or 2 RDPs 36 . Quasi-2D-treated films, however, contain
n  ≥ 3 RDPs, with the PEA treatment producing more
n  ≥ 3 RDPs than BTA. Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) confirmed that these 2D layers lie horizontal to the substrate (Supplementary Fig.
13 ), as in other reports 5 , 13 , 15 . Recently, it was documented that bulk quasi-2D perovskite films made using fluorinated PEA ligands form different QW structures compared to unfluorinated PEA 35 . To this end, we tested PEA-based ligands with a fluorine at each node (Fig.
1c ) and found that this has a dramatic effect on the QW distribution (Supplementary Fig.
16 ). Mostly notably, we found that using our quasi-2D surface strategy, 3-fluoro-phenethylammonium (3F-PEA) produces a 2D/3D heterojunction containing majority
n  = 3 RDP (Fig.
2f ). The structures of all 2D ligands mentioned are shown in Fig.
1c . Fig. 2: Comparison of 2D and quasi-2D treatments using different 2D ligands. a – c , TA spectra of films treated with BTA ( a ), PEA ( b ) and 3F-PEA ( c ) using the standard 2D treatment.

The majority absorption in each case is from the 3D perovskite (780 nm) but this has been excluded for clarity. Absorption peaks are assigned in order, and a comparison with single-cation quasi-2D films is shown in Supplementary Table

3D perovskite films were spun at 1,500 r.p.m. and a constant 1 ps pump–probe delay time was used. The quasi-2D treatments for BTA ( g ), PEA ( h ) and 3F-PEA ( i ) were all dropped at 7.2 s. Source data Full size image To better understand why different ligands produce different RDP distributions, we the measured TA spectra in situ while spin coating quasi-2D treatments (Fig.
2g–i ). With a pump–probe delay of 1 ps and a time resolution of 0.3 s, we spun films at 1,500 revolutions per minute (r.p.m.) and deposited the 2D treatment dynamically. A reduction in the 3D perovskite absorption is apparent ~2.4 s after solution deposition for all samples. For the BTA treatment, this reduction in 3D bleach is concurrent with the arrival of a strong
n  = 2 bleach. For the PEA-based treatments, the 2D signal does not appear until ~1.2 s after the 3D bleach reduction. It has been suggested that bulkier organics intercalate more slowly, which induces them to form wider RDPs 34 . Our results agree, indicating that π–π stacking ligands form wider RDPs due to slower crystallization, which suppresses narrower RDP formation. This is corroborated by films treated using hexylammonium (HA) and octylammonium (OTA) ligands, which demonstrate an increased presence of
n  ≥ 3 RDP with increasing ligand length (Supplementary Fig.
14 ). To investigate the effect of increased π–π stacking, we treated samples with 1-naphthylmethylammonium (Fig.
1c ) but found that the quasi-2D treatment substantially reduced the RDP absorption in the TA spectra (Supplementary Fig.
15 ). We also gained insight into why 3F-PEA forms wider RDPs. Standard PEA produces
n  = 2 and 3 simultaneously, whereas 3F-PEA forms
n  = 3 one frame (0.3 s) before the appearance of
n  = 2, suggesting that
n  = 3 is preferentially formed from the precursor complex. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to compute the formation energy of
n  = 1, 2, 3 and 4 RDPs for each ligand (details in Supplementary Text
5 ). As previously reported 4 , the formation energy of the
n  = 1 RDP was found to be the lowest for all ligands; however, this was not supported by our experimental findings or results from other studies 36 , 37 . Nonetheless, considering that forming single layers of lead iodide (PbI 2 ) is considerably more energy intensive than larger slabs (Fig.
3a ) it seems reasonable that
n  = 1 layers are less likely to form, especially when excess cations are available as within the quasi-2D treatment. Hence, we compared the formation energy of
n  ≥ 2 RDPs. Generally, we found that formation energy increases with increasing width, however, we also found that bonding different ligands onto 2D perovskite flakes (FA n −1 Pb n I 3 n −1 ) introduces different types of strain into the system which is released through different distortions of the perovskite (Supplementary Fig.
22 ). The specific orientation and arrangement of the ligands caused by the fluorine atom in 3F-PEA (structure taken from 35 ) introduces larger strain compared to PEA or BTA, manifesting as larger distortions, and therefore larger perovskite flakes are need to fully release the additional strain. As a result, a sweet spot for
n  = 3 is found in the formation energy of 3F-PEA (Fig.
3b ), which results in the preferential formation of
n  = 3 revealed in the TA data. We calculated the formation energies for each of the ligands
1 – 7
in Fig.
1c
(Supplementary Fig.
21 , Supplementary Text
5 ), but only 3F-PEA possessed a preference for
n  ≥ 3. Fig. 3: Formation of quasi-2D perovskite capping layers from density functional theory. a , The PBE+TS calculated formation energy of perovskite flakes ((FA) n −1 Pb n I 3 n −1 , see inset). The formation energy of FAPbI 3
is shown as a dashed line. Note that the energy required to form a single-layer (PbI 2 ) flake ( n  = 1 RDP) is much higher than for other layer widths. PBE+TS, Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional with the Tkatchenko–Scheffler dispersion correction.

21 . Source data Full size image Band alignment of 2D/3D heterostructures We proposed to modulate the
n
distribution of 2D/3D heterojunctions with the aim of reducing the electron barrier at the perovskite/ETL interface. To verify this, we used surface-sensitive inverse photoelectron spectroscopy (IPES), which directly measures the conduction band of the first few nanometres of film 29 , 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 . Following work from Endres et al. 42
we used gaussian fittings to extract the CBM and found that, as expected, the CBM values of 2D-treated surfaces are upshifted compared with the controls (Fig.
4a–c ). Using the quasi-2D treatment the 2D/3D CBM offset is reduced substantially for PEA- and 3F-PEA-treated films relative to their
n  = 1 (and/or 2) analogues (0.42–0.14 eV and 0.49–0.08 eV, respectively) but less so for BTA (0.41–0.31 eV). We measured the potential of our film surfaces using Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and found a similar trend (Supplementary Fig.
17 ). This complements the results in the previous section which suggest that the quasi-2D treatment using BTA produces fewer
n  ≥ 3 RDPs than PEA or 3F-PEA. We also performed surface-sensitive UPS on control, 2D- and quasi-2D-treated films (Supplementary Fig.
18 ) to produce the schematics in Fig.
4e,f . Similar to the plot in Fig.
1b
and several previous reports 18 , 28 , 29 , altering the RDP width has little effect on the VBM, and reducing confinement simply shifts the conduction band deeper, closer to the 3D perovskite. More details on these UPS and IPES measurements can be found in Supplementary Text

IPES measurements were taken using a bandpass filter of 254 nm (4.88 eV) for the control and PEA-treated films and 280 nm (4.42 eV) for BTA- and 3F-PEA-treated films.

Source data Full size image Carrier extraction and photovoltaic performance To explore the device implications, we investigated the charge transport in BTA-, PEA- and 3F-PEA-treated films using the 2D and quasi-2D treatments. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) increases after the standard 2D treatment for each ligand (Supplementary Table
6 ), suggesting a reduced density of non-radiative recombination centres 8 . This effect is enhanced slightly by the quasi-2D treatment, indicating improved passivation. A similar trend is visible in transient photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy results (Fig.
5a
and Supplementary Fig.
24 ), where longer lifetimes are recorded for 2D- and quasi-2D-treated films (a summary of lifetimes is found in Supplementary Table
3 ). The modestly improved passivation of the quasi-2D treatment may be due to the addition of MAI, which has also been reported to passivate perovskite surfaces 43 . Fig. 5: Carrier extraction and performance of quasi-2D-treated PSCs. a , Transient PL from bare films treated with 3F-PEA.

The asterisk indicates the point at which the MPP tracking was paused for 12 h. Source data Full size image Following the work of Kirchartz et al., we deposited [6,6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) atop the perovskite as an ETL and used the quenched
τ 1
lifetimes to compare charge extraction (Fig.
5b ) 44 . The quenched
τ 1
lifetime of the control film was 4.6 ns. After deposition of 3F-PEA this doubled to 9.2 ns, suggesting that the standard 2D treatment impedes the flow of electrons from the perovskite to the ETL. Using the quasi-2D treatment this was reduced to 4.9 ns, implying a considerably improved extraction compared with the standard 2D treatment. A similar trend is seen using BTA and PEA (Supplementary Fig.
24 ). For quantitative values we repeated these observations using power-dependent TA (Supplementary Text
6
and Supplementary Table
8 ) and space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements. From the TA data we found that both 2D and quasi-2D treatments reduced the surface recombination velocity (from ~600 cm s −1
to ~300 cm s −1 ). The SCLC measurements show a similar trend (Supplementary Fig.
27 ) but the overall effect is less obvious as we are examining the entire film and not simply the interfaces. In PSCs using bulk RDPs, films that contain mixed-dimensional phases have reduced mobility due to charge trapping in the higher
n
species 3 . To understand why this is not necessarily the case in 2D/3D heterostructure films, we used TA spectroscopy to measure the charge dynamics. Using a 450 nm pump at a low power (5 µJ cm −2 ) to avoid Auger recombination 45 , we excited the 2D and 3D layers of 2D- and quasi-2D-treated films. Measuring the
n  = 2 bleach decay (~570 nm) using monoexponential fits, we calculated the carrier funnelling rates for both treatments; a summary of the results is shown in Supplementary Fig.
28 . For a standard 2D-treated film, there are no peaks present for
n  > 2 (Fig.
2a ), thus we expect the charges to funnel directly from
n  = 2 to the 3D perovskite 1 , 46 , for which we observed a 28.6 ps decay time. When we generate a favourable pathway for electrons by adding a layer of PCBM, we observed a faster decay (7.5 ps). Repeating these measurements with a quasi-2D-treated film, we observed a decay without PCBM of 5.8 ps, suggesting that the charges are funnelled to the now present
n  > 2 species 1 , 46 . However, adding a layer of PCBM resulted in an even faster decay (1.2 ps), indicating that charge trapping does not play a limiting role in charge extraction. To gauge the effect of the 2D and quasi-2D treatments in full device stacks, we conducted transient photovoltage (Supplementary Fig.
25 ) and transient photocurrent measurements (Fig.
5c ). Following ref.
47 , devices were biased with the same white-light intensity to reach near- V OC
conditions and were photoexcited with low-power laser pulses to generate small photovoltage perturbations (Δ V , kept to lower than 20 mV). Monoexponential fits were used to estimate the carrier lifetime under
V OC
and short-circuit current density ( J SC ) conditions. We observed a slower decay in photovoltage for the quasi-2D-treated films compared with the standard 2D treatment (Supplementary Fig.
25 ), which is consistent with the TRPL results and indicates a reduction in trap states in the absorber. More importantly, we observed a faster decay in the photocurrent for the quasi-2D-treated films ( τ quasi-2D  = 0.82 µs compared with
τ 2D  = 1.28 µs for 3F-PEA-treated films), which suggests a substantial improvement in carrier extraction 48 . In addition, we performed conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) on these films, revealing increased conductivity in quasi-2D-treated films (Supplementary Figs.
31
and
32 ). We fabricated devices with an ITO/NiO x
nanoparticles/perovskite/PCBM/BCP/Ag structure using different surface treatments (BTA, PEA, 2F-PEA, 4F-PEA and 3F-PEA; standard 2D and quasi-2D treatments) for statistical analysis (Supplementary Figs.
33 – 36 ). In agreement with our finding that increased
n  ≥ 3 RDPs result in more efficient charge extraction, 3F-PEA outperformed the PEA- and BTA-treated devices. Improved performance of the quasi-2D-treated over the standard 2D-treated devices is derived mainly from FF and
J SC
improvements; a typical set of current density–voltage ( J – V ) curves are shown in Fig.
5d
along with their figures of merit. To check the reproducibility, we provide statistics for devices fabricated over a one-year period (September 2020 until September 2021) in Supplementary Figs.
37 – 39 . To confirm that improved passivation alone was not the cause of the increased FF, we simulated the effect of reducing only the surface trap density using the SCAPS-1D simulation tool (Supplementary Fig.
40 ) and found that a 20 mV difference in
V OC
would correspond to an increase in FF of approximately 0.5% rather than the 2.2% increase manifested. A quasi-2D-treated device was certified at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The C 60 /BCP-based device produced a quasi-steady-state certified PCE for inverted PSCs of 23.91% (with FF = 83.46,
J SC  = 24.90 mA cm −2
and
V OC  = 1.15 V; Supplementary Fig.
43 ). A voltage loss of 0.38 V is the lowest documented for a NiO x -based PSC (bandgap from the external quantum efficiency, Supplementary Fig.
42 ) 49 . We focused on improving the performance of the NiO x -HTL inverted PSCs because they have shown high stability at elevated temperatures 19 , 49 , 50 . However, 2D treatments have been shown to be unstable above 50 °C, degrading in a matter of hours 51 ; thus it was crucial to ascertain whether or not any new 2D treatment could withstand high temperatures. We prepared 2D- and quasi-2D-treated films and heated them at 65 °C for 20 h, periodically measuring their characteristics via TA spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig.
41 ). We found that the
n
distribution of both treatments was robust under heating, suggesting that the quasi-2D treatment could be used to produce extremely stable devices. We evaluated the stability of the devices under accelerated-ageing conditions according to International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS) protocols 52 . We tracked the maximum power point (MPP) of two quasi-2D-treated devices under illumination at ~50% relative humidity. An unencapsulated device was monitored at room temperature for 1,000 h (ISOS-L-1I) and an encapsulated device on a temperature-controllable stage was monitored at 65 °C for 500 h (ISOS-L-3), and the results are shown in Fig.
5e,f , respectively. The unencapsulated room-temperature devices showed no degradation after 1,000 h of MPP tracking (4.9% increase in PCE), whereas the device baked at 65 °C lost around 8% of its maximum PCE after 500 h. On the basis of a linear extrapolation from these data, we estimate the
T 80
lifetime of this device (that is, the time required to drop to 80% of the initial efficiency) to be 1,190 h (Supplementary Fig.
45 ) 20 , 52 . After 500 h the MPP tracking for the heated device was paused but the cell remained under illumination at 65 °C, and after 12 h the MPP tracking was resumed. The PCE of the device recovered to 99% of the initial PCE, which is an encouraging indicator of its real-world long-term stability 53 . We note that the device structure was not altered for stability testing and the initial efficiency of both devices was >23% (Supplementary Fig.
44 ). Therefore, we report an ISOS-L-3 accelerated-ageing test that corresponds directly to high-efficiency PSCs (>20% PCE). Conclusion We presented a simple technique that alters the QW widths in 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures. This was tailored to improve inverted PSCs, and was accomplished by reducing the confinement within the 2D capping layer to reduce the electron barrier between the 3D and 2D perovskite species. This resulted in highly stable NiO x -based PSCs with certified efficiency values, and could be useful in other metal halide-based optoelectronics devices in which well-passivated, negative–intrinsic contacts are desirable. Methods Materials All the materials were used as received without purification. Commercial indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates (20 Ω per square) with dimensions of 25 × 25 mm were purchased from TFD. PbI 2
and bathocuproine (BCP) were purchased from TCI. Caesium iodide (CsI) (99.999%) and fullerene (C 60 ) (99.5%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. PEAI, FAI (formamidinium iodide) and MAI were purchased from GreatCell Solar. 2F-PEAI (2-fluoro-phenethylammonium iodide), 3F-PEAI, 4F-PEAI (4-fluoro-phenethylammonium iodide) and 1-naphthylmethylammonium iodide were purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology. PCBM was purchased from Nano-C. All the solvents used in the process were anhydrous and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Nickel oxide nanoparticle synthesis The NiO x
nanoparticles were prepared via the hydrolysis of nickel nitrate following previous work 54 , 55 . Briefly, Ni(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O (20 mmol) was dissolved in deionized water (20 ml) to obtain a dark-green solution. Then, NaOH aqueous solution (4 ml, 10 mol l −1 ) was slowly added to the dark-green solution with stirring. After being stirred for 20 min, the colloidal precipitate was washed thoroughly using deionized water three times and dried at 80 °C for 6 h. The obtained green powder was then calcined at 270 °C for 2 h to obtain a black powder. The NiO x
nanoparticle ink was prepared by dispersing the obtained NiO x
nanoparticles in a mixed solution of deionized water and IPA (3:1, v/v) for a concentration of 10 mg ml −1 . Solar cell fabrication ITO glass was cleaned through sequential washing with detergent, deionized water, acetone and IPA. Before use, the ITO was cleaned with ultraviolet ozone for 20 min. For the inverted solar cells, the substrate was spin-coated with a thin layer of NiO x
nanoparticle film using the NiO x
nanoparticle ink at 2,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. The perovskite absorber layers were deposited inside a nitrogen-filled glovebox with a controlled water and oxygen level of less than 1 ppm. The temperature inside was monitored to be 25–30 °C. The precursors for the Cs 0.05 FA 0.85 MA 0.1 PbI 3
perovskites were prepared by dissolving the PbI 2 , MAI, CsI and FAI in a mixed solvent (4:1 in volume) of DMF and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), respectively. This was done by adding the powders to a vial (20 ml size) and then adding the mixed solvent (1 ml) before leaving the vial on a stirring hotplate set to 60 °C for 30 min; all steps were undertaken in a glovebox. For fabrication of the perovskite film, the substrate was spun at 2,000 r.p.m. for 30 s with an initial acceleration of 1,000 r.p.m., and then at 6000 r.p.m. for 10 s with an acceleration of 6000 r.p.m. per second. In the second step, anisole (150 μl) was added dropwise onto the substrate during the last 5 s of spinning. The substrate was immediately placed on a hotplate and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. For the surface treatment, the 2D solutions were prepared by dissolving the 2D ligand salts (that is, PEAI, BTAI, 3F-PEAI, HAI and OTAI) with or without MAI and DMF in IPA. The ligand salt (1 mg ml −1 ), MAI (0.5 mg ml −1 ) and an IPA:DMF v/v ratio of 1:200 was used, unless stated otherwise. The 2D layer was fabricated by depositing the 2D ligand solution (150 µl) onto the perovskite film surface, and immediately after deposition the film was spun at a rate of 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s with a 4,000 r.p.m. per second acceleration. The film was then annealed at 100 °C for 5 min. For the ETL, either C 60 /ALD-SnO 2
or PCBM/BCP were used. C 60
was formed via evaporation, and deposition of the ALD-SnO 2
(atomic-layer-deposited tin(IV) oxide) was carried out using a PICOSUN R-200 Advanced ALD system. Water and tetrakis(dimethylamino)tin(IV) (TDMASn) were used as the oxygen and tin precursors, respectively. The precursor and substrate temperature was set to 75 °C and 85 °C, respectively. Nitrogen gas (90 sccm) was used as carrier gas. Pulse and purge times for water were 1 s and 5 s, respectively, and 1.6 s and 5 s, respectively, for TDMASn. The total deposition cycle is 134 s, corresponding to 20 nm of SnO 2 . PCBM was formed by spin coating the PCBM solution (20 mg ml −1
in chlorobenzene) at 1,000 r.p.m. for 30 s and then annealing at 100 °C for 5 min. Then a thin and uniform BCP layer was deposited via drop‐casting 2–3 drops of BCP dissolved in IPA while spinning the substrate at 5,000 r.p.m. Finally, a 120-nm-thick silver contact was deposited on top of the BCP using thermal evaporation under high vacuum (<5 × 10 −7  torr) using an Angstrom Engineering deposition system to produce a cell with an active area of 0.053 cm 2 . For non-inverted solar cells, the substrate was spin-coated with a thin layer of SnO 2
nanoparticle solution (1:3:3, SnO 2
(15% in water):IPA:water) at 3,000 r.p.m. for 20 s and annealed in ambient air at 150 °C for 1 h. The perovskite solution was prepared by dissolving FAPbI 3
(889 mg ml −1 ), MAPbBr 3
(33 mg ml −1 ) and MACl (33 mg ml −1 ) in DMF/DMSO (8:1 v/v) mixed solvent. Then, the solution was coated onto the ITO/SnO 2
substrate through two consecutive spin-coating steps, at 1,000 r.p.m. for 5 s and 2,500 r.p.m. for 20 s. During the second spin-coating (2,500 r.p.m.) step, diethyl ether (1 ml) was poured onto the substrate after 15 s. The intermediate phase substrate was then put on a hotplate at 150 °C for 10 min. After the fabrication of the 3D perovskite film, the 2D layer was fabricated by depositing a solution (5 mg ml −1 ) of PEAI in IPA onto the perovskite film and then spinning the substrate at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. Then, the substrate was heat-treated at 100 °C for 5 min. For deposition of the hole transport material, a spiro-OMeTAD solution in chlorobenzene (90.9 mg mL −1 ) was prepared, and lithium-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide solution in acetonitrile (23 μl, 540 mg mL −1 ) and pure 4- tert -butylpyridine (39 μl) were added to an aliquot of the solution (1.1 ml). The spiro-OMeTAD solution including additives was spin-coated onto the perovskite surface at 1,750 r.p.m. for 30 s. Finally, a gold electrode was deposited via thermal evaporation to produce a cell with an active area of 0.053 cm 2 . Reduced-dimensional film fabrication Reduced-dimensional (PEA) 2 (MA/FA/Cs) n −1 Pb n I 3 n +1
perovskite solutions were prepared by dissolving the appropriate stoichiometric quantities of PbI 2 , MAI (or FAI or CsI) with PEAI in DMF/DMSO (4:1 v/v). The resulting solution was filtered using a polytetrafluoroethylene syringe filter (0.2 μm) before deposition. Then, the solution was coated onto the glass substrate through two consecutive spin-coating steps, at 1,000 r.p.m. for 5 s and 2,500 r.p.m. for 20 s. During the second spin-coating (2,500 r.p.m.) step, diethyl ether (1 ml) was poured onto the substrate after 15 s. The intermediate phase substrate was then put on a hotplate at 150 °C for 10 min. Device testing The current density–voltage ( J – V ) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under illumination from a solar simulator (Class A, Newport) with a light intensity of 100 mW cm −2
(checked using a calibrated reference solar cell from Newport). The
J – V
curves were measured in a nitrogen atmosphere with a scanning rate of 100 mV s −1
(a voltage step of 10 mV and a delay time of 200 ms). The active area was determined by the aperture shade mask (0.049 cm 2
for small-area devices) placed in front of the solar cell. A spectral mismatch factor of unity was used for all
J – V
measurements. For stabilized output measurements at the MPP, the device testing chamber was left under ambient conditions. Solar cells were fixed at the MPP voltage, (determined from
J – V
sweeps in both scanning directions) and the current output was tracked over time. Stability testing Devices were placed in a homemade stability-tracking station. The illumination source is a white-light LED with its intensity calibrated to match 1-Sun conditions. For room-temperature tests (ISOS-L-1I), the device chamber was sealed and supplied with continuous nitrogen purging. For the ISOS-L-3 ageing test, the device chamber was left open in a room with 50 ± 10% relative humidity, and the solar cell was mounted on a metal plate kept at 65 °C using a heating element. A thermal couple attached to the metal plate was used to monitor and provide feedback control to the heating element to ensure temperature consistency. The MPP was tracked using a perturb-and-observe algorithm that updates the MPP value every 10 s. Encapsulation was done by capping the device with a glass slide, using UV-adhesive (LT-U001, Lumtec) as the sealant. X-ray diffraction X-ray diffraction patterns were collected using a Rigaku D/Max-2500 diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα1 radiation ( λ  = 1.54056 Å). Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering GIWAXS measurements were conducted at the BL14B1 beamline of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility using X-rays with a wavelength of
λ  = 1.24 Å at a grazing incidence angle of 0.3° and an exposure time of 80 s. The GIXRD patterns were collected using a MarCCD 225 detector with a sample–detector distance of 280 mm and were presented in
q
coordinates using the equation
q  = 4πsin θ /λ, where
θ
is half of the diffraction angle. In the present GIXRD data,
q
has been calibrated by measuring the X-ray diffraction from a lanthanum hexaboride reference sample. Images were calibrated using lanthanum hexaboride and processed using the
Nika
software package 56
and the
GIXSGUI
MATLAB plug-in 57 . Simulations Simulations of PSCs were conducted using the heterojunction solar cell simulator SCAPS-1D, version 3.3.07 30 . Full simulation details can be found in Supplementary Text
2 . Conductive atomic force microscopy Scanning probe microscopy experiments were carried out under ambient conditions using an Asylum Research Cypher S AFM instrument with low-force-constant (k = 2.8 N m −1 ), Ti/Ir-coated, silicon cantilevers (ASYELEC.01-R2). Contact-mode AFM was used to simultaneously produce surface and current maps applying a fixed bias voltage of −0.6 V. Measurements were obtained under top illumination from a 3 W white LED. Transient absorption spectroscopy Femtosecond laser pulses of 1,030 nm generated using a Yb:KGW laser at a 5 kHz repetition rate (Pharos, Light Conversion) were passed through an optical parametric amplifier (Orpheus, Light Conversion) to select 450 nm light. This served as the pump pulse, whereas the probe pulse was generated by focusing the initial 1,030 nm pulse into a sapphire crystal, which resulted in a white-light continuum (Helios, Ultrafast). With a temporal resolution of the system of
∼ 350 fs, each time step meant delaying the probe pulse with respect to the pump, with time steps that increased exponentially. Every other pump pulse was blocked using a chopper to determine the change in optical density. After going through a grating spectrograph, the pulses were measured using a charge-coupled device (CCD) (Helios, Ultrafast). Spinning in situ TA spectroscopy was performed using a purpose-built spinner, designed such that the incident probe light could pass through the spinning substrate and be directed into the CCD. The pump–probe delay was set to 1 ps. The time resolution of the system was 0.3 s. The measurements were taken in an ambient atmosphere with 35% relative humidity. Photoluminescence quantum yield measurements The excitation source was an unfocused beam from a 442 nm continuous-wave diode laser. Photoluminescence was collected using an integrating sphere with a pre-calibrated fibre coupled to a spectrometer (QE Pro, Ocean Optics) with an intensity of ~100 mW cm −2 . PLQY values were calculated using
\({\mathrm{PLQY}} = \frac{{P_{\mathrm{S}}}}{{P_{{\mathrm{ex}}} \times A}}\) , where
\(A = 1 - P_{\mathrm {L}}/P_{\mathrm {Ex}}\) ,
P S
is the integrated photon count of the sample emission on laser excitation,
P ex
is the integrated photon count of the excitation laser when the sample is removed from the integrating sphere and
P L
is the integrated photon count of excitation laser when sample is mounted in the integrating sphere and hit by the beam. Space-charge-limited current measurements SCLC measurements were obtained using electron-only (ITO/SnO x /perovskite/PCBM/Ag) devices and hole-only (ITO/NiO x /perovskite/poly(triaryl amine)/Au) devices separately. A Keithly 2400 source meter was used to measure the relevant
J – V
curves. We calculated the trap density ( n t ) by SCLC measurement in the hole-only and electron-only devices. The trap-state density
n t
can be calculated using the following relation: $$n_{\mathrm{t}} = \frac{{V_{{\mathrm{TFL}}}\varepsilon \varepsilon _0}}{{eL^2}}$$ where
e
is the elementary charge,
L
is the perovskite film thickness (~650 nm),
ε 0
is the vacuum permittivity,
ε
is the relative dielectric constant and
V TFL
is the onset voltage of trap-filled limit region. Transient photoluminescence spectroscopy TRPL measurements were carried out using a Horiba Fluorolog time-correlated single photon counting system with photomultiplier tube detectors. A pulsed laser diode (634 nm, 110–140 ps pulse width) was used as the excitation source for steady-state and transient measurements. For transient measurements, a 7,200 ns period for unquenched films and an 800 ns period for quenched films (0.28 nJ per pulse) was used to capture accurate carrier lifetimes. Inverse photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy For combined UPS and IPES measurements, an Excitech H Lyman-α photon source (10.2 eV) with an oxygen-filled beam path was used for excitation, coupled with a PHI 5600 ultrahigh vacuum system with a hemispherical electron energy analyser. A sample bias of –5 V and a pass energy of 5.85 eV were used for UPS acquisition. IPES measurements were performed in the Bremsstrahlung isochromat mode with electron kinetic energies below 5 eV and an emission current of 2 μA to minimize sample damage. A Kimball Physics ELG-2 electron gun with a barium oxide cathode was used to generate the electron beam; the emitted photons were collected using a bandpass photon detector that included an optical bandpass filter (280 nm for 3F-PEA- and BTA-treated films, and 254 nm for the control and PEA-treated films) and a photomultiplier tube (R585, Hamamatsu Photonics). Samples were held at a −20 V bias during all IPES measurements and the ultrahigh vacuum chamber was blacked-out to exclude external light. Perovskite films sent for combined UPS/IPES were fabricated on ITO/NiO x
substrates. UPS measurements of quasi-2D perovskite films were carried out using a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250XL instrument; a −10 V bias was applied for UPS measurements. Transient photovoltage/photocurrent measurements These measurements were carried out according to ref.
47 . Kelvin probe force microscopy KPFM was conducted using an MFP-3D AFM (Asylum Research, Oxford Instruments) with conductive Ti/Ir-coated tips (ASYELEC.01-R2 probe,
f  = 71.72 kHz,
k  = 2.8 N m −1 ). The tips were calibrated using Sader’s method 58 , 59 . The KPFM measurement was implemented using a two-path method at a scan rate of 0.5 Hz, where the first pass in every scan line was used to determine the topography and the following second pass was used to measure the contact potential difference between the tip and the sample. The second pass was scanned by raising the tip at a fixed 20 nm height above the sample following the topography. Each set of samples was arranged in proximity on a common substrate and were measured using the same tip and scanning parameters. We also adopted different scanning sequences of the samples in each set to ensure that the obtained potential trend is reliable and the global drift (if any) is not dominating. The two sets of samples (PEA- and 3F-PEA-treated) were measured using different probes, thus a shift in the overall potential is observed.

Abstract
The thermal stability and decomposition products of formamidinium, a widely used organic cation in perovskite solar cell formulation, were investigated. The thermal degradation experiments of formamidinium-based perovskites and their halide precursors were carried out under helium atmosphere and vacuum at a constant heating rate of 20 °C min −1 . In addition, pulsed heating steps were employed under illumination/dark conditions to simulate a more realistic working temperature condition for photovoltaic devices. The identification of gas decomposition products was based on the quadrupole mass spectrometry technique. The released amounts of
sym -triazine, formamidine, and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) were observed to highly depend on the temperature. For the experimental conditions used in this study,
sym -triazine was obtained as the thermal product of degradation at temperatures above 95 °C. Below this temperature, only formamidine and HCN generation routes were observed. The energy pathways of formamidinium thermal degradation under photovoltaic working temperature conditions were further assessed by density functional theory calculations. The results indicated that formamidinium was more resilient to thermal degradation and the release of irreversible decomposition products compared to methylammonium because of a larger enthalpy and activation energy obtained for the decomposition reactions. The HCN instantaneous concentration observed during the low temperature heating tests and the estimations of the maximum release of HCN achievable per meter-square of an FA based perovskite based solar cell were compared to acute exposure guideline levels of airborne HCN concentration.

Abstract
Metal halide perovskite materials (ABX 3 ) employed in optoelectronic devices have rapidly achieved high efficiencies. Their performance can be partially attributed to intrinsic defects being electronically benign. Despite the inertness of defects within the bulk, such as ion vacancies, solution processing additives and surface passivation have been shown to enhance material properties. Thus, detailed knowledge of additive chemistry is desirous to elucidate passivation mechanisms and facilitate further improvements. In particular, the soft Lewis acid nature of Pb 2+
has been overlooked heretofore as a key feature of amine-lead chemistry in perovskite preparations. In Part I of this study, we demonstrate that acid–base reactions between PbI 2
and aliphatic amines yield alkylammonium and Pb–alkylamide species. The alkylammonium and alkylamide products are capable of occupying A-site cation and anion vacancies, respectively. Subsequent incorporation of these impurities at perovskite crystal surfaces or formation of non-perovskite phase inclusions likely influence the perovskite layer morphology and properties which are investigated in Part II. These results reveal a new mechanism by which optoelectronic properties of perovskites can be chemically modified. Additionally, the general concept of acidification of organic molecules solvated to Pb 2+
promoting unexpected reactions is applied to explain amine reactions with other additives, such as formic acid. Understanding acid–base reactions induced by PbI 2
complexing to protic molecules is useful to comprehend and predict defect/impurity chemistry in a wide variety of perovskite precursor formulations.

, Accepted 15th April 2019 First published on 15th April 2019 Abstract Organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites with over 23% power conversion efficiency have attracted enormous academic and industrial attention due to their low-cost fabrication and high device performance. Self-passivated tin oxide as an electron transport layer has shown potential mainly due to the enhanced electron transfer, stability and reduced hysteresis device features. Here we report on novel, non-colloidal tin oxide precursors based on acetylacetonate (one halide free and two halogenated with Cl and Br respectively). We explore the unique film morphology acquired from the non-colloidal precursors and the improved device performance they yield. Our results show that the halide residue in the films plays an impactful role in the thermal durability of the fabricated SnO 2
film, as well as providing a passivation layer. Moreover, our optimized tin oxide films achieved an unprecedented power conversion efficiency of 22.19% in planar perovskite solar cells (21.4% certified by Newport), and once upscaled to large-area modules, 16.7% devices based on a 15 cm 2
area were achieved.
Broader context
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are efficient photovoltaic devices composed of a light absorbing layer which is sandwiched between two charge extracting layers. Passivated tin oxide is extensively used as an electron extracting layer due to its excellent optoelectronic properties. Here, we fabricate high-performing passivated tin oxide films with three novel metalorganic precursors based on acetylacetonate complexes. We demonstrate with various tools the film morphology, optoelectronic properties, and elemental analysis yielded with each precursor and correlated with the device performance. Our champion devices obtained a 22.19% and 16.7% power conversion efficiency for small-sized cells and 15 cm 2
mini-module devices, respectively.
Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells are swiftly emerging as standalone photovoltaic technology. Since the first study by Kojima
et al. , the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has undergone rapid improvement from 3.8% to over 23% in under a decade of development. 1–3
The high efficiency attained from perovskite materials is due to their excellent optoelectronic properties, which were optimized by adjusting the composition and ratio of cations and anions within the perovskite lattice. 4,5
These compositionally engineered, photoactive perovskite layers can be deposited using either one or two step solution processable methods. 6–8,15,22
In addition to the perovskite composition, the horizon of research has expanded to enhancing the electron transporting layer (ETL), 9–11
perovskite absorber and hole transporting layers (HTL) 12,13
and implementing scalable fabrication techniques. 14
For TiO 2
based ETLs, relatively high resistivity is known to cause insufficient charge separation at the compact TiO 2
(c-TiO 2 )/perovskite interface. 16–18
Therefore, an additional layer of mesoporous TiO 2
(mp-TiO 2 ) is usually adopted to complement the deficient charge collection. 16–18
Recently, SnO 2
based electron transporting layers have been extensively used due to SnO 2 's high conductivity and superior charge collection ability compared to TiO 2
ETLs. 19–21
SnO 2
has a wide bandgap ranging between 3.6 and 4.1 eV, and its favourable conduction band edge in relation to perovskites makes SnO 2
a good candidate to overcome challenges which occur particularly with c-TiO 2
ETLs. 23
Previously, low-temperature processes were mostly used to form SnO 2
layers to avoid pin-holes on an FTO or ITO substrate with a rough film surface. However, the metal-like nature shown in degenerate semiconductors,
i.e. , the carrier density of non-doped SnO 2
is
ca.
10 20
cm −3
(in the range of semimetals), seems to generate another serious shunting pathway, decreasing the fill factor (FF) and open-circuit voltage ( V oc ). 25,26
We have demonstrated previously that the low PCE is due to the deteriorated hole-blocking ability of the SnO 2
ETL caused by loss of self-passivating materials such as SnOCl 2
and residual precursor of tetrakis-dimethyl-amine-tin (TDMASn). 21,24
By using different precursors and depositing them with various techniques such as spin-coating and atomic layer deposition methods, we proved the advantages of the low-temperature process are not limited to preventing pin-holes but also include electrically passivating the SnO 2
ETL. 21,24
In this work, we investigated the film and device performance for planar-type perovskite solar cells using tin acetylacetonate based precursors for SnO 2 . To better understand the role of halides, one of the chosen precursors is halide-free and two are based on chloride and bromide respectively. The optimized devices achieved a high efficiency of 22.19% in a small-size cell and 16.73% in a large area 15 cm 2
module.
Device structure
Fig. 1
shows the device architecture of a planar perovskite solar cell consisting of fluorine-doped SnO 2
(FTO)/c-TiO 2 /SnO 2 /perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/gold layers. In our previous work, we confirmed that the ‘Type 1’ passivation ETL by combining a c-TiO 2
underlayer with the passivated tin oxide (PTO) top layer provides better hole-blocking ability than a single passivated SnO 2
layer, which resulted in the further enhanced PCE. 21,24
For tin oxide layers, we investigated three metalorganic tin precursors from the same family, tin( II ) bis(acetylacetonate) (hereafter Acac), tin( IV ) bis(acetylacetonate) dichloride (hereafter Cl 2 ) and tin( IV ) bis(acetylacetonate) dibromide (hereafter Br 2 ), with DMF as a solvent.

Film and device characteristics
The structure of the SnO 2
films is characterized with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Films are prepared by dropping precursor solutions on a carbon support grid and heat-treating at 180 °C for 1 h in air. Pairs of bright field (BF) and dark field (DF) TEM images and corresponding selected area electron diffraction patterns (SAEDP) are presented in
Fig. 2 . The SAEDP show reflections for [110], [101], [200], and [211] index planes for all films, corresponding to rutile-type SnO 2 . TEM images show that the films are comprised of small crystallites (<2 nm), as is further confirmed by high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) images (Fig. S2, ESI † ). The acquired TEM images and SAEDPs indicate the co-presence of short to medium range ordered regions in the SnO 2
films, a property which we previously observed in SnO 2
films prepared with
e.g.
colloidal SnCl 4 21
and atomic layer deposited TDMASn 24
at low temperature. We monitored the composition of the films using energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry in scanning TEM mode (EDXS-STEM). High-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM images and corresponding EDXS elemental maps (Fig. S1, ESI † ) indicate that the layers formed from all the precursors are comprised of Sn and O elements, as well as residual halogenated by-product, after post-annealing at 180 °C for Cl 2
and Br 2
films. High-resolution TEM images are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI † ). For the Acac film, plenty of pinholes and randomly sized crystallites are observed. On the other hand, other precursor films have compact surfaces with an average crystallite size of around 2 nm and 1 nm respectively for Cl 2
and Br 2
films.

layer. Bright-field (BF) and dark-field (DF) TEM images of SnO 2
films deposited on a carbon support grid, and corresponding selected area electron diffraction patterns (SAEDP). Simulated electron diffraction pattern of rutile-type SnO 2
is included at the lower left part of the SAEDP.
To evaluate the compatibility for the ETL, we measured the photoluminescence (PL) of the bi-layered electron transporting layer (BETL)/perovskite films as seen in
Fig. 3a . Despite differences in the PL intensity, all BETLs show a faster electron quenching efficiency than the c-TiO 2
film. According to the result, Acac shows the fastest quenching rate, and Cl 2
and Br 2
show slightly slower electron transfer as indicated by the PL peaks. Therefore, a higher PCE was expected with the Acac devices, but the device performance demonstrated in
Fig. 3b
shows that the trend of the PL measurement does not match well with the device efficiency. The highest PCE is gained from the Cl 2
precursor due to the contribution of enhanced FF and
V oc . For Br 2 , the high
V oc
is promising. However, the Br 2
devices show a relatively low FF and a slightly lower short-circuit current density ( J sc ) than c-TiO 2 . Unlike the PL result, we found that the Acac precursor may not contribute to distinct efficiency enhancement. To explain this observation, we utilized scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to examine the surface morphology of SnO 2
fabricated with Acac. The full-size image of the complete cells is shown in Fig. S3 (ESI † ). Moreover, we performed absorbance and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) on SnO 2
samples spin-coated with perovskite as seen in Fig. S4 (ESI † ) and examined the perovskite surface morphologies with SEM as seen in Fig. S5 (ESI † ). The absorbance, XRD pattern and SEM imaging confirm that the perovskite films deposited on SnO 2
have roughly similar thickness and morphology regardless of the SnO 2
precursor. However, in the cross-sectional SEM images in Fig. S5 (ESI † ), the Cl 2
and Br 2
films clearly show an increase in the SnO 2
film thickness. However, for the Acac devices, there is no observable increase of the ETL thickness when compared with the c-TiO 2
SEM cross-sectional image. Fig. S6 (ESI † ) shows SEM top-view images of c-TiO 2
and c-TiO 2 /PTO films formed on the FTO substrate. The magnified images show all SnO 2
precursors form a thin and similarly uniform top layer over the c-TiO 2
underlayer. However, different film morphology can be observed for the SnO 2
prepared with Acac when the magnification is increased. Randomly distributed big particles potentially caused by the aggregation of the precursor are detected on the film surface. The particle sizes range from 1 to 2 μm in diameter and induce huge bumps on the perovskite film as seen in Fig. S7 (ESI † ). The poor morphology in Acac films could be due to the meta-stability of the tin oxidation state. For Acac, the Sn 2+
metal center is four coordinate with two bidentate acetylacetonate ligands. While for Cl 2
and Br 2 , the Sn 4+
metal atom is six coordinate with two bidentate acetylacetonate ligands and two monodentate halogen ligands. In this configuration, Sn 4+
is more likely to be stable in a DMF solution, unlike the case with Sn 2+ , which could be oxidized more readily in DMF. In a preliminary test, we found that Acac dissolves easily in DMF and forms a transparent solution, but starts to precipitate in a couple of hours as seen in Fig. S7 (ESI † ). Whereas for Cl 2
and Br 2
dissolved in DMF, the solutions do not lose transparency over a month. For Acac, the bumps observed in Fig. S7 (ESI † ) could potentially provide a shunting route particularly for planar-type cells by forming a thin PTO layer which increases the possibility of pinhole formation. These findings indicate that there are complex challenges associated with Acac in terms of film reproducibility and performance. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was further performed to characterize the Cl 2
and Br 2
films. Strong peaks at 486 and 494 eV attributed to Sn 4+
ions indicate the formation of SnO 2
as seen in
Fig. 3d . A weak asymmetry shown in all spectra can be explained by Sn 2+
ions originating from oxygen vacancies ( V oc ) on the SnO 2
surface, which are assumed to be the origin of the high conductivity of the SnO 2
film. 24
Strong asymmetry of the spectra indicating the presence of sub-bonds is also observed in the O 1s region ( Fig. 3e ), which is associated with the binding energy for the O–S bond (Sn 4+ ) with higher intensity at 529.2 eV. The smaller peak at 530.5 eV can be associated with oxygen impurities such as OH ligands and water adsorption on the film. 27
In addition, we found a small peak assigned to Cl 2p at 197 eV from the Cl 2
film, and a strong peak of Br 3d at 68 eV from the Br 2
film. This is in good agreement with the result of EDX analysis in Fig. S1 (ESI † ). For the Cl 2
film, when varying the annealing temperature, the highest intensity peak of the film slightly decreases from 100 °C to 180 °C annealing. Moreover, the Cl bond peak is still present at 220 °C but is significantly minimized. A similar trend is observed from the Br 2
film, however, it is noteworthy that the intensity of the Br 3d peak remains strong even when annealing at 220 °C.

To find the optimal annealing temperature, we carefully prepared SnO 2
films between 160 °C and 350 °C for Cl 2
and Br 2 .
Fig. 4a
shows a statistical summary of the device efficiency with respect to temperature. The best PCE is found at 200 °C for Cl 2 , while the highest PCE is obtained at 220 °C for the Br 2
device. It should be noted that the Br 2
devices show a relatively gentle drop of PCEs at high temperatures while the Cl 2
devices demonstrate a steep decrease after the maximum value. Both devices show a rapid increase of
J sc
according to the ramping of the temperatures until the maximum
J sc
is reached (close to 24 mA cm −2
at 200 °C). An analogous trend is observed in the FF. Although a high FF is shown with the 160 °C devices, we found a severe drop of electron transfer as seen in Fig. S8 (ESI † ). Here, it is noteworthy to remember the film formation of the tin oxide layer from SnCl 4
and other chloride-based precursors. 18,19
Unlike Cl 2 /Br 2
precursors in DMF, SnCl 4
immediately reacts with H 2 O to form SnO 2
nanoparticles and amorphous SnOCl 2
which are not reversibly dissolved in water, indicating the solution is in fact colloidal. 18
As with water-based colloidal SnO 2
precursors
i.e. , AlfaAesar 15% SnO 2 , an impressively low temperature processing is required, 150 °C. 20
However, surface passivation can potentially occur by SnOCl 2
and base sources potentially added for stable dispersion of the colloid,
i.e.
NaOH, KOH, 28
if SnO 2
nanoparticles are synthesized using chlorine based tin precursors (Fig. S9, ESI † ). Therefore, despite a lower device performance, the film contains more crystalline SnO 2 , therefore no current loss (decrease of
J sc ) is found despite film drying at 100 °C. However, the Cl 2 /Br 2
precursors do not visibly react with DMF and sustain their solution form, which means smaller or fewer SnO 2
crystallites can be formed at low temperatures, and more residual precursor exists on the film, which can cause higher series resistance at low-temperature annealing. This explains the reason for the different behaviour shown in
Fig. 4a and b . With the same reason, a high
V oc
is measured for the 160 °C film probably caused by electron accumulation. An unexpected result is found from the
V oc
trend of the Br 2
devices. A gradual drop of
V oc
is seen when increasing the annealing temperature beyond 250 °C. Nevertheless, the Br 2
devices maintain a
V oc
over 1.1 V even at 350 °C. This result implies that the bromide residue is more strongly bound to the film than the chloride counterpart, even at exceptionally high annealing temperature. Further statistical comparison with mp-TiO 2
based cells is summarized in Fig. S10 (ESI † ). To supplement this analogy thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted and is displayed in
Fig. 4b . For both Cl 2
and Br 2
the precursors start to lose weight at
ca.
150 °C, mainly attributed to thermal decomposition. For Cl 2 , roughly 90% of weight is lost by crystallization at 250 °C, followed by a gradual weight drop implying complete removal of Cl on the film. Br 2
shows rather slower weight loss, and the conversion to SnO 2
appears to finish roughly at 300 °C. The subsequent drop that goes up to 500 °C can be attributed to removal of residual Br. Considering Cl sublimes more easily than Br, this finding is reasonable. The TGA curves further support the result and agree well with the EDX and XPS results.
J – V
curves at the optimal conditions are depicted in
Fig. 4c . PTO layers clearly show better PCEs. The highest PCE of 21.12% is obtained from Cl 2 . A bit lower PCE is measured with Br 2 , but it also shows a high PCE over 20%, which is still higher than that with a single c-TiO 2
ETL. We confirmed the optimized bi-layered c-TiO 2 /PTO layers show lower PL emission than the 180 °C films ( Fig. 4d ). We measured the reflectance of the films, and the optical bandgap ( E g ) was calculated by applying the Kubelka–Munk ( F ( R )) method 27
by plotting ( F ( R ) ×
hν ) 2
as a function of energy. Subsequently, an
E g
of 3.92 and 3.93 eV for Cl 2
and Br 2
respectively was estimated ( Fig. 4e ). Fermi-levels ( E f ) were measured by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), confirming that both Cl 2
and Br 2
films have the same
E f
of 4.21 eV. The
E g
and
E f
estimations imply that the Cl 2
and Br 2
films possess similar optical and electronic properties. Additionally, the c-TiO 2 /Cl 2
ETL was tested for a monolithic series module, and a 16.73% PCE was obtained with a 15 cm 2
aperture area (Fig. S11, ESI † ).

The best device seen in
Fig. 5a
shows promising photovoltaic values in a planar structure with a
J sc
of 24.78 mA cm −2 , a
V oc
of 1.13 V, a FF of 0.79, and a PCE of 22.19% under 1 sunlight illumination conditions when scanned backward. With forward scanning, the values are slightly lower, and very small
J – V
curve hysteresis is measured in a planar-type device. We assume the better PCE is from extended light absorption and enhanced perovskite film quality as seen in the EQE and SEM top-view images (Fig. S12 and S13, ESI † ). We confirmed the
J sc
value from the solar simulator agrees with the calculated
J sc . The device shows excellent performance in the stabilized condition measurement ( Fig. 5b ). We also found BETL based perovskite cells have outstanding long-term stability until 200 days when cells are stored in a drawer without encapsulation (Fig. S14, ESI † ). To get reliable data, our cells are measured again at Newport. Although a small loss of
V oc
is found potentially due to use of a smaller active area and possible degradation in air, a similar and certified PCE of 21.37% on average was confirmed ( Fig. 5c
and Fig. S15, ESI † ).

Conclusions
We investigated the film and device performance with non-colloidal SnO 2
precursors based on acetylacetonate, namely tin( II ) acetylacetonate (Acac), tin( IV ) bis(acetylacetonate) dichloride (Cl 2 ) and tin( IV ) bis(acetylacetonate) dibromide (Br 2 ). We have confirmed with TEM the presence of rutile type SnO 2
in the film with varying degrees of crystallinity, contributing to self-passivation and improved device performance. Moreover, while the Acac precursor produced randomly sized and distributed SnO 2
crystallites, Cl 2
and Br 2
produced dense SnO 2
films with a passivating, halogenated by-product. In addition, we demonstrated the ability of Br 2
to retain the
V oc
of the devices with up to 350 °C annealing post-treatment due to the delayed sublimation of the bromide by-product as confirmed with TGA. This finding could extend the application of passivated tin oxide to high-temperature processed perovskites such as lead-free CsSnI 3 . Ultimately, we confirm the importance of surface passivation for SnO 2 , specifically for perovskite solar cell applications due to its metal-like nature. Cl 2
and Br 2
are proved to provide excellent surface passivation to enhance the hole-blocking ability. The champion cell achieved a PCE of 22.19% and was obtained using Cl 2 . Our findings highlight the importance of passivation for SnO 2
and suggest inspiring ideas for broader and diverse passivation routes for SnO 2
based solar cells.
Methods
Materials
Tin( II ) acetylacetonate (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), tin( IV ) bis(acetylacetonate) dichloride (98%, Sigma-Aldrich), tin( IV ) bis(acetylacetonate) dibromide (97%, Sigma-Aldrich). Dimethylformamide (99.9%, Acros), dimethyl sulfoxide (99.9% Acros), PbI 2
(TCI), PbBr 2
(TCI), formamidinium iodide (Dyesol), methylammonium bromide (Dyesol), methylammonium chloride (Dyesol), spiro-OMeTAD (Borun), tBP (Sigma-Aldrich), Li-TFSI (Dyesol), FK-209 (Dyesol).
Film and device fabrication
FTO glass substrates (Nippon sheet glass) were sequentially cleaned with detergent and ethanol. A compact TiO 2
layer was coated by spray pyrolysis deposition on the cleaned FTO substrates heated at 450 °C. SnO 2
layers are prepared by spin-coating a precursor solution of tin acetylacetonate based precursors dissolved in dimethylformamide. 0.1 M SnCl 4
aqueous solution was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 10 s on the substrates to get a ∼20 nm thickness. Then the substrates were transferred onto a hotplate and heated between 160 °C and 350 °C for 1 h and cooled down. The (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15
precursor solution was prepared by mixing PbI 2
(1.15 M, TCI), PbBr 2
(0.2 M, TCI), FAI (1.05 M, Dyesol), and MABr (0.2 M, Dyesol) in a mixed solvent of DMF : DMSO = 4 : 1 (volume ratio). The precursor solution was spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 10 s and continuously at 5000 rpm for 30 s. During the second step, 100 μL of chlorobenzene was poured on the film at 15 s. Films are post-annealed at 100 °C for 60 min. For the two-step deposition method, PbI 2
(1.3 M) containing 2.5 mol% PbBr 2
was dissolved in 1 mL of DMF and DMSO (ratio = 4 : 1) solution at 80 °C. Then the solution was spin coated on the SnO 2
substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s, and a mixture solution of FAI : MABr : MACl (80 : 10 : 10 mg in 1 mL IPA) was spin coated on the PbI 2
substrate at 5000 rpm for 30 s. Films were annealed at 150 °C for 25 min and 100 °C for 30 min. Finally, spiro-OMeTAD was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 25 s. The 70 mM spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving in chlorobenzene with 4- tert -butylpyridine, Li-TFSI in acetonitrile, and Co[ t -BuPyPz] 3 [TFSI] 3
(FK209, Dyesol) in acetonitrile at a molar ratio of spiro : FK209 : Li-TFSI : TBP of 1 : 0.03 : 0.5 : 3.3. Devices were completed with thermal evaporation of 70 nm thickness gold counter electrodes.
Film characterization
XRD analysis was carried out using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer in an angle range of 2 θ
= 10° to 40°. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were carried out on a ZEISS Merlin at 5 kV, and images were acquired by an in-lens secondary electron detector. Transmission electron microscopy imaging and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis were performed on a FEI Tecnai Osiris at 200 kV. This microscope is equipped with a high brightness X-FEG gun and silicon drift Super-X EDX detectors and Bruker Esprit acquisition software. Samples for TEM imaging were prepared
via
depositing the SnO 2
film on a TEM grid with a carbon support film. The TEM grids were then heat-treated at 180 °C. XPS analysis was done using equipment (a Quantum 2000 system) with an Al Kα X-ray source ( hν : 1487 eV) and a hemispherical electron analyzer. The XPS results provide average chemical information on a spatial area of 100 μm diameter and a depth of 5–10 nm. Absorbance and reflectance were measured with an integrating sphere using UV/vis/NIR spectroscopy (PerkinElmer Lambda 950S). The photoluminescence emission was measured with a fluorescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer LS 55). TGA analysis (TGA 4000 PerkinElmer) was done at a scan rate of 10 °C min −1
from 30 °C to 500 °C. The UPS measurements were performed using a home-made photoemission spectroscopy system, which consists of an ultraviolet source (VUV 5000) and an electron analyzer (SES-100) in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber. A He II source of 40.8 eV, controlled using a monochromator, enables us to obtain precise electronic structures from UPS spectra.
Device measurement
The solar cell measurement was done using an Oriel solar simulator (450 W xenon, AAA class). The light intensity was calibrated with a Si reference cell equipped with an IR-cutoff filter (KG3, Newport), and it was recorded prior to measurement. Current–voltage characteristics of the cells were obtained by applying an external voltage bias while measuring the current response with a digital source meter (Keithley 2400). The voltage scan rate was 100 mV s −1
and no device preconditioning, such as light soaking or forward voltage bias applied for a long time, was applied before starting the measurement. The cells were masked with an active area of 0.16 or 0.89 cm 2
to fix the active area and reduce the influence of the scattered light. The EQE was measured with an IQE200B (Oriel) without bias light.

Devices for energy harvesting Photovoltaics Solar cells
Abstract The main bottlenecks limiting the photovoltaic performance and stability of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are trap-assisted non-radiative recombination losses and photochemical degradation at the interface between perovskite and charge-transport layers. We propose a strategy to manipulate the crystallization of methylammonium-free perovskite by incorporating a small amount of 2-aminoindan hydrochloride into the precursor inks. This additive also modulates carrier recombination and extraction dynamics at the buried interface via the formation of a bottom-up two-dimensional/three-dimensional heterojunction. The resultant inverted PSC achieves a power conversion efficiency of 25.12% (certified 24.6%) at laboratory scale (0.09 cm 2 ) and 22.48% at a larger area (1 cm 2 ) with negligible hysteresis. More importantly, the resulting unencapsulated devices show superior operational stability, maintaining >98% of their initial efficiency of >24% after 1,500 hours of continuous maximum power point tracking under simulated AM1.5 illumination. Meanwhile, the encapsulated devices retain >92% of initial performance for 1,200 hours under the damp-heat test (85 °C and 85% relative humidity).

In situ energetics modulation enables high-efficiency and stable inverted perovskite solar cells

Main Inverted (p-i-n) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently drawn intensive attention, owing to their merits of compatibility with different bottom cells for tandem solar cells 1 , 2 , low-temperature processability 3 , 4
and excellent stability 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 . Researchers have carried out numerous studies to improve the performance and stability of inverted PSCs, such as compositional engineering 10 , additive engineering 11 , 12 , processing methods 13
and interface engineering 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 14 , 15 , 16 . Although the efficiency of inverted PSCs has increased substantially over the years 12 , methylammonium (MA + ) and bromide (Br − ) are usually employed to modulate the crystal growth and stabilize the photoactive black phase of formamidinium lead triiodide (α-FAPbI 3 ) 4 , 12 , 17 , 18 . However, since MA +
was certified to easily volatilize and escape from the perovskite crystal lattices, large amounts of MA +
doping (≥10 mol%) would cause material degradation of α-FAPbI 3
at high temperatures and thus reduce thermal stability of the corresponding PSCs 19 , 20 . In addition, mixed halide (I/Br) perovskites inevitably suffer from phase segregation, which is exacerbated under light illumination and thermal ageing 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 . In the long run, MA- and Br-free perovskite is highly desirable for the fabrication of long-term operationally stable perovskite solar cells 26 . To overcome the above problems, caesium (Cs + ) cations have been widely adopted to prepare more stable mixed cation perovskites Cs x FA 1− x PbI 3
(refs.
27 , 28 ). While the doping of a small amount (≤5 mol%) of Cs +
has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy for stabilizing the α-FAPbI 3
(refs.
4 , 29 , 30 ), without the incorporation of MA +
and Br − , it is still challenging to manipulate the crystallization dynamics of Cs x FA 1− x PbI 3
on a planar substrate, such as the hydrophobic poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine) (PTAA) films. Therefore, a facile modulation approach for preparing MA + - and Br − -free perovskite film should be urgently developed to further enhance the performance of inverted PSCs. Interfacial non-radiative recombination poses a serious challenge for the further advancement of the photovoltaic performance of inverted PSCs 31 . Recently, great efforts have been made to manipulate the perovskite/electron transport layer (ETL) interface 4 , 6 , 7 , 8 . For example, Zhu and coworkers employed an organometallic compound (FcTc 2 ) to modify the perovskite/C60 interface and achieved an attractive performance due to effective defect passivation and ameliorated interfacial electron transfer 8 . In contrast to the perovskite/ETL top interface, the buried perovskite/hole transport layer (HTL) interface receives less attention. Considering most interfacial modulation molecules are easy to dissolve in polar solvents, that is,
N,N -dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), while spin-coating perovskite precursor solution, it is much more difficult to modulate the HTL/perovskite buried interface compared with the top interface. The HTL/perovskite buried interface contains a high density of deep-level trap states, which is much larger than that within the perovskite film 32 . The NiO x /perovskite interface also suffers from poor photostability because of interfacial reactions 33 , 34 . In addition, the energy barrier at the buried interface leads to imperfect interfacial hole extraction and thus low photovoltaic performance 35 , 36 . Consequently, it is urgently needed to minimize non-radiative recombination losses at the HTL/perovskite buried interface and enhance interfacial stability in inverted PSCs by facile interface engineering. Interestingly, Wakamiya and coworkers 37
modified the HTL/perovskite buried interface by directly incorporating glycine hydrochloride into the perovskite precursor ink. They revealed that the head group (–NH 3 + ) of GlyH +
can bind to the surface of perovskite crystallites, which prefer to sediment at the bottom interface. Finally, the –NH 3 +
head was towards the perovskite layer, while the tail group (–COOH) was anchored to HTL, forming an interfacial dipole and thus electric field, which accelerated hole extraction and transfer. This indicates that appropriate ammonium salts would self-assemble at the buried interface when it is introduced into the precursor solution. Since two-dimensional (2D) perovskites have been widely employed to modify grain boundaries (GBs) and the surface of three-dimensional (3D) perovskites 6 , 7 , constructing a bottom-up 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction is highly desirable through incorporating tailored organic ammonium salts into the precursor ink. Herein we manipulated the crystallization of MA-free perovskite film (for example, Cs 0.05 FA 0.95 PbI 3 ) and minimized the interfacial non-radiative recombination losses simultaneously by incorporating a small amount of 2-aminoindan hydrochloride (AICl) into the perovskite precursor inks. This strategy enabled high-quality MA-free perovskite films with improved crystallization, fewer trap states and enhanced interfacial hole extraction and transport, which stabilized this important interface and minimized non-radiative recombination losses. The resultant inverted device delivered a PCE of 25.12% (certified 24.6%) at laboratory scale (0.09 cm 2 ) and 22.48% at larger device area (1 cm 2 ) with negligible hysteresis. Moreover, the resulting unencapsulated device demonstrated excellent operational stability by maintaining >98% of its initial efficiency after 1,500 hours of continuous maximum power point (MPP) tracking under simulated AM1.5 illumination. The outstanding damp-heat stability was confirmed for an encapsulated device, which retained >92% of the initial PCE value after 1,200 hours ageing at 85 °C and 85% relative humidity (RH). Characterization of MA-free perovskite films We adopted a stable MA- and Br-free perovskite composition (Cs 0.05 FA 0.95 PbI 3 ) as light absorber to maximize the performance of inverted PSCs. The perovskite film was fabricated through a one-step method. To regulate the crystallization of Cs 0.05 FA 0.95 PbI 3
films, we added a small amount of AICl into the perovskite precursor inks to form a 2D/3D heterojunction at the bottom interface. The chemical structure of AICl is shown in Supplementary Fig.
1 . The perovskite films and the relevant devices made with incorporation of AICl are hereafter denoted as ‘target’. To form 2D perovskite at the bottom interface, we designed a large indan aromatic tail with large π-conjugation, which was attached to an ammonium A-site cation (-NH 3 + ). Owing to the large size of the indan aromatic skeleton, the solubility of AICl molecules in DMF/DMSO mixed solvents is very low (Supplementary Fig.
2 ). Meanwhile, the interactions between AI +
and PbI 2
are stronger than that of FA + , which leads to easier formation of 2D perovskites than 3D perovskites, as evidenced by
1 H NMR spectra (Supplementary Fig.
3 ). Considering the low solubility and stronger interaction towards PbI 2 , we infer that an AI-based 2D perovskite ((AI) 2 (FA) n −1 Pb n I 3 n −1 Cl 2 ) nucleate could form in the precursor inks. To verify this, we conducted dynamic light scattering measurements to investigate the colloidal properties of the precursor inks. As depicted in Supplementary Fig.
4 , a large colloid with particle size over 1 µm appeared in the target precursor, which may be the prenucleation cluster caused by AI + . Therefore, we can infer that AI +
can preferentially react with PbI 2
to form a 2D perovskite crystallite in the precursor solution. The precrystallized 2D crystallites will sediment at the bottom interface, act as a seed crystal and provide nucleation sites for manipulating the crystallization of 3D perovskite crystals, which contributes to improved film quality (Supplementary Note
1
and Supplementary Fig.
5 ). Therefore, it is speculated that the 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction should be successfully constructed at the bottom interface by incorporating well-designed AICl into the precursor ink. In comparison to the control perovskite film, the target film showed an improved morphology with larger sized grain domain (Supplementary Fig.
6 ). As a result of the improved morphology, the carrier mobility was increased from 17 cm 2  V −1  s −1
to 28 cm 2  V −1  s −1
after modification (Supplementary Fig.
7 ). It is worth noting that the charge-carrier mobility could be reduced slightly with increase of excitation intensity, and charge-carrier lifetime was also reduced due to the increase in bimolecular recombination losses 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 . The photoluminescence and UV–visible absorption spectra show that the band gap and light-harvesting properties of the target perovskite film with the addition of AICl were unchanged (Supplementary Fig.
8 ). Next, we investigated the vertical distribution and form of existence of AICl salts in the perovskite films. Time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) measurements show that the 2D spacer species (AI +
and Cl − ) were accumulated at the perovskite/HTL interface in the target sample (Fig.
1a
and Supplementary Fig.
9 ). We performed 2D grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) to further investigate the formation of 2D perovskite at the bottom interface (Fig.
1b ). As expected, the 2D perovskite signal can only be detected with high incidence angle, which indicates that 2D perovskite was mainly formed at the bottom of 3D perovskite films. The target films exhibited diffraction
q z
peaks at ~0.3 to ~0.4 A −1 , indicating the formation of 2D perovskite crystals. We also investigated the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the target films by measuring from the front and back direction. As shown in Fig.
1c , the emission peaks at ~640 nm of 2D perovskites can only be detected from the back side, which demonstrates that the 2D perovskites were only formed at the bottom interface in the target films. These emission peaks were redshifted with respect to the dominant emission peak at ~492 nm of
n  = 1 2D perovskite ((AI) 2 PbI 2 Cl 2 ) (Supplementary Fig.
10 ). From these data we inferred that 2D perovskites ( n  ≥ 2) were formed at the 3D perovskite GBs at the buried interface, which was further supported by the theoretical calculations (Supplementary Fig.
11
and Supplementary Note
2 ). The cross-section of the target device was characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS; Supplementary Fig.
12 ). Cryogenic focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) was used to prepare the TEM specimen without damaging the inherent structures of the perovskite layer 42 . As shown in Fig.
1d
and Supplementary Fig.
13 , a thin layer of 2D perovskites ((AI) 2 (FA) n −1 Pb n I 3 n −1 Cl 2 ) could be clearly discerned at the GBs of the 3D perovskite layer at the buried interface, which is consistent with the TOF-SIMS, PL and GIWAXS results. Meanwhile, the formation of this unique 2D/3D heterojunction is independent of the types of substrate (Supplementary Fig.
14 ). In a word, the addition of a small amount of AICl into the perovskite precursor solution resulted in spontaneous formation of a bottom-up 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction at the buried interface, as illustrated in Fig.
1e . Fig. 1: Structural characterizations of the bottom-up 2D/3D heterojunction at the buried interface. a , TOF-SIMS profile of ITO/NiO x /PTAA/Al 2 O 3 /perovskite with bottom-up 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction at buried interface (2D spacer species: CN −

e , Device configuration of the inverted PSCs with bottom-up 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction at the buried interface. Full size image Investigation of interfacial carrier dynamics We next investigated the effect of the bottom-up 2D/3D heterojunction at the buried interface on the charge-carrier transport and recombination in the perovskite layer. The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of the control and target perovskite films deposited on the glass substrates are shown in Fig.
2a . According to previous reports, the rapid decay of the first stage is determined by the initial hole transfer and carrier capture, and the decay of the second stage is only related to non-radiative recombination 43 , 44 . To simulate the TRPL data, we used the kinetic model described in our previous study 5 . From the simulations, we find that the carrier lifetime of perovskite films was increased from 762 ns ( k 1  = 6.6 × 10 5  s −1 ) to 1,119 ns ( k 1  = 4.5 × 10 5  s −1 ) after addition of AICl, indicating reduced defect density in the modified perovskite films. Additionally, the space charge-limited current measurements (Supplementary Fig.
15 ) further confirmed the decreased defect density through the addition of the AI +
2D spacer. The reduced defect density should be responsible for increased carrier lifetimes and carrier mobility, which resulted in inhibited trap-assisted non-radiative recombination. Fig. 2: Charge-carrier dynamics. a , b , TRPL spectra of the control and target perovskite films deposited on a bare glass substrate ( a ) and glass/NiO x /PTAA/Al 2 O 3
substrate ( b ). TRPL measurements were conducted with excitation from the glass side and with an emission wavelength of 810 nm. The solid line shows the fitting curves. To simulate the TRPL data, we used a model based on the continuity equation for the carrier concentration

Methods . Norm Δ R , normalized change in reflection. Full size image We then deposited perovskite films on NiO x /glass substrate and used the quenched
τ 1
lifetimes to compare charge extraction (Fig.
2b ). The quenched
τ 1
lifetime of the control film was 64.5 ns. After constructing the bottom-up 2D/3D heterojunction at the buried interface, the quenched
τ 1
lifetime of the target film was reduced to 29.4 ns, implying considerably improved charge extraction. Fits to the TRPL transients were used to compute the differential lifetime using the model of Krogmeier et al. 45
(Supplementary Fig.
16 ). The charge-transfer process at early times (~100 ns) led to a faster rise of differential lifetime in the target film than the control film. The occurrence of non-radiative first-order recombination is marked by a transition from an increasing carrier lifetime to a flat period, implying a fundamental end of charge transfer. To quantify how the TRPL lifetime is related to surface carrier extraction, we further investigated these films using transient reflection spectroscopy (TRS), from which carrier diffusivity ( D ) and surface extraction velocity (SEV) could be extracted 46 , 47 , 48 . Figure
2c,d
illustrates the surface carrier kinetics measured with transient reflection excited with three different pump pulses (2.50 eV, 2.10 eV and 1.65 eV). By simultaneously fitting the decay of charge carriers with a kinetics model (details of fits are shown in the
Methods ) that includes both diffusion and surface recombination, best-fit values of
D
and SEV were obtained (Supplementary Table
1 ). In our modelling,
D
represents the charge diffusivity and, as in thin films, both electrons and holes will diffuse together in a pair and we model them as an ambipolar diffusion constant. On the other hand, SEV only represents hole extraction velocity. For the control perovskite film, the extracted
D
and SEV values were 1.88 ± 0.10 cm 2  s −1
and 3,600 ± 500 m s −1 , respectively. The target sample exhibited improved
D
(1.94 ± 0.11 cm 2  s −1 ) and SEV (4,100 ± 400 m s −1 ) values, indicating that the hole extraction was facilitated by inserting our bottom-up 2D/3D heterojunction at the perovskite/HTL interface, which is consistent with the computed differential lifetimes. Certainly, improved morphology is also one of the important reasons for boosted carrier diffusivity, which contributed to enhanced carrier mobility. The energy level diagram in Supplementary Fig.
17
manifests that the cascade energy band alignment was formed because the valance band maximum (VBM) of 2D perovskite was located between the VBM of HTL and the VBM of 3D perovskite, which should be primarily responsible for improved hole extraction and collection, as confirmed by TRPL, TRS and transient photocurrent results. In short, the formed bottom-up 2D/3D heterojunction can promote hole extraction and suppress interfacial non-radiative recombination, which could account for the increased photovoltaic performance. Photovoltaic performance and long-term stability Next, we fabricated inverted PSCs with a structure of ITO/NiO x /PTAA/Al 2 O 3 /Cs 0.05 FA 0.95 PbI 3 /PCBM/BCP/Ag. The optimal concentration of AICl was determined by comparing the device photovoltaic performance (Supplementary Fig.
18 ). The relevant devices made from the addition of 1.5 mg ml −1
AICl are hereafter denoted as ‘target’. The average PCE value was increased from 21.94 ± 0.70% for the control device to 24.58 ± 0.35% for the target device with AICl additive (Fig.
3a ), mainly due to the increases in open-circuit voltage ( V oc ) from 1.122 ± 0.011 to 1.156 ± 0.010 V, short-circuit current density ( J sc ) from 25.36 ± 0.40 to 26.23 ± 0.20 mA cm −2
and fill factor (FF) from 77.73 ± 1.88% to 81.06 ± 0.89% (Supplementary Fig.
19
and Supplementary Table
2 ). We attained a PCE of 25.12% for the best-performing target device ( J sc
of 26.22 mA cm −2 ,
V oc
of 1.165 V and FF of 82.2%), along with negligible hysteresis and a stabilized PCE of 25.05% (Fig.
3b
and Supplementary Fig.
20 ). One of the best-performing devices was validated by an independent solar cell accredited laboratory (National Photovoltaic Product Quality Inspection and Testing Center, China) for certification, where a PCE of 24.60% (with
J sc  = 25.69 mA cm −2 ,
V oc  = 1.173 V and FF = 81.63%) was confirmed (Supplementary Fig.
21 ), which is higher than the values reported for all inverted PSCs based on MA-free perovskite reported to date (Fig.
3c
and Supplementary Table
3 ). Corresponding external quantum efficiency spectra (Supplementary Fig.
22 ) yielded an integrated
J sc
of 24.88 mA cm −2
for the target device and 23.92 mA cm −2
for the control device, which was just slightly lower than the values obtained from
J–V
measurements. The addition of AICl thus showed a marked improvement in PCE, which is associated with an enhanced
V oc
and FF, as well as
J sc . The Mott–Schottky plots demonstrated a higher flat-band potential for the target device compared with the control device (Supplementary Fig.
23 ), which is directly related to an increase in
V oc . Moreover, we found that the target device has a smaller ideality factor ( n id ) than the control device (Supplementary Fig.
24 ), indicating the improved interfacial charge transfer/transport and suppressed non-radiative recombination channels, which accounts for the enhanced
V oc
and FF. The increase in
J sc
is ascribed to improved interfacial energy band alignment and thus charge extraction due to the formation of stepped band alignment induced by the bottom-up 2D/3D heterojunction at the perovskite/HTL interface 49 . The addition of AICl also contributed to the improved uniformity of the large-area perovskite films with less density of defects. As a result, in comparison to the control devices, the large-area target device with aperture area of 1.0 cm 2
showed better performance (Fig.
3d
and Supplementary Fig.
25 ). A champion PCE of 22.48% was obtained for the large-area target device, which is also the highest value among all large-area inverted PSCs reported so far (Supplementary Table
4 ). Furthermore, AICl additive is universal for various perovskite compositions, as demonstrated by the systematic absolute PCE enhancement of 1.2 to 2.6% for device performance (Supplementary Figs.
26
and
27
and Supplementary Table
2 ). Fig. 3: Device performance and stability. a , PCE histogram of 20 PSCs with (target) and without (control) bottom-up 2D/3D heterojunction at buried interface. The solid line is a Gauss peak fit of the distribution.

atmosphere. The initial PCE of control, target-1 and target-2 devices is 21.73%, 24.42% and 24.11%, respectively.
f , Damp-heat stability of the encapsulated control and target devices following the ISOS standards (85 °C and 85% RH). The initial PCE of control and target devices is 22.15 ± 0.13% and 24.32 ± 0.20%. The error bar is the standard deviation of three devices. Data are presented as mean values ± s.e.m. Source data Full size image As a comparison, we also predeposited different amounts of AICl salts on the indium tin oxide (ITO)/HTL substrates before 3D perovskite formation (Supplementary Fig.
28 ), which is expected to form bottom-up 2D/3D heterojunctions according to previous reports 16 , 27 . As shown in Supplementary Fig.
29a , it is clear that a 2D perovskite layer was formed at the bottom of the 3D perovskite film. However, the fabricated inverted PSCs with the bottom-up 2D/3D perovskite films show poor photovoltaic performance compared to the control device (Supplementary Fig.
29b ). These results further prove the advantages of our strategy of incorporating the 2D perovskite spacer into precursor inks. Finally, we evaluated the stability of the high-efficiency inverted PSCs under accelerated ageing conditions according to the International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS) protocols 50 . The long-term operational stability of the unencapsulated control and target PSCs was evaluated by MPP tracking under constant simulated AM1.5 illumination (100 mW cm −2 ). Both the target devices maintained over 98% of their initial PCE of >24% after 1,500 hours of continuous tests at 55 ± 5 °C, whereas the control device degraded to 78% of its initial PCE of 21.73% (Fig.
3e ). Additionally, we conducted damp-heat measurements for the encapsulated devices at 85 °C in the 85% relative humidity-controlled chamber. As shown in Fig.
3f , the target device exhibited a
T 90
(the time over which the device efficiency reduces to 90%) of >1,000 hours under the heating stress and thus successfully passed the main point of ISOS qualification for thermally accelerated ageing conditions (ISOS-T-1). The enhanced thermal and operational stability can be attributed to a lower concentration of defects and the suppressed ion migration at the HTL/perovskite interface caused by the construction of the bottom-up 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction 6 , 7 . Taken together, these data indicate that inverted PSCs with tailored bottom-up 2D/3D heterojunction at the buried interface exhibited excellent efficiency and stability, and this work takes an important step towards the realization of commercial perovskite-based single- and multiple-junction solar cells. Methods Materials All chemicals and solvents were used as received without further purification.

PTAA (molecular weight distribution: 6,000–15,000) and bathocuproine (BCP) were purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology. 2-Aminoindane hydrochloride (AICl, 98%) was bought from Macklin. NiO x
nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized according to previous work 51 . Device fabrication ITO-coated glass substrates were etched by laser. The etched ITO glass was ultrasonically cleaned for 15 min using detergent, deionized water (twice) and ethanol (twice), sequentially. ITO-coated glass substrates were treated by ultraviolet ozone (UVO) for 30 min. Then, the 25 mg ml −1
NiO x
NP aqueous ink was prepared by dispersing as-prepared NiO x
NPs into deionized water and then spin-coating onto ITO glass at 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. The NiO x
films were annealed at 150 °C for 10 min under ambient conditions. Then, the obtained NiO x
films were immediately transferred into a nitrogen-filled glovebox. PTAA solution (1 mg ml −1 ) in CB was spin-coated onto NiO x
films at 6,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. After that, Al 2 O 3
dispersion solution (0.4 wt% in IPA) was spin-coated onto PTAA films at 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. Perovskite films with different compositions were deposited by the spin-coating method (details presented below). Subsequently, the 23 mg ml −1
of PC 61 BM solution in CB was spin-coated onto the perovskite films at 2,500 r.p.m. for 40 s. Then, 5 mg BCP was added into 1 mL IPA and shaken for 5 min to prepare a supersaturated solution, which was filtered using a PTFE filter before use. Afterwards, the obtained saturated solution was spin-coated on PC 61 BM film at 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. Finally, a 100 nm Ag electrode with an active area of 0.11 cm 2
and 1.10 cm 2
was deposited by thermal evaporation for small-area and large-area devices, respectively. For FA 0.95 Cs 0.05 PbI 3
perovskite films, 1.4 M perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 228.4 mg FAI, 18.2 mg CsI and 645.4 mg PbI 2
and AICl (0, 1, 1.5, 2 and 3 mg ml −1 ) in mixed solvents of DMF and DMSO (v/v, 4/1). The perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated on glass/ITO/NiO x /PTAA/Al 2 O 3
substrate at 2,000 r.p.m. for 10 s and then at 4,000 r.p.m. for 40 s. During the second spin-coating step, 150 µl CB was dropped onto the perovskite film at 5 s before the end of the programme. The resultant wet perovskite films were annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. For (FA 0.85 MA 0.15 ) 0.95 Cs 0.05 Pb(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3
triple-cation perovskite films, 1.5 M perovskite precursor solution was prepared by mixing CsI, FAI, MABr, PbI 2 , PbBr 2
and AICl (0, 1, 1.5, 2 and 3 mg ml −1 ) in 1 ml mixed solvents of DMF:DMSO (v/v, 5/1), where excess 10 mol% of PbI 2
was added to improve the device performance. A 60 μl perovskite solution was spin-coated onto glass/ITO/NiO x /PTAA/Al 2 O 3
substrate at 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. A 250 μl portion of CB was slowly dripped onto the centre of the film at 7 s before the end of spin-coating. The as-prepared perovskite films were subsequently annealed on a hotplate at 110 °C for 60 min. For MAPbI 3
perovskite films, the perovskite precursor solution was prepared by mixing 1.55 M MAI and 1.63 M PbI 2
in 1 ml mixed solvents of DMF:DMSO (5/1, v/v), and stirring for 2 h before use. A 40 μl portion of perovskite solution was spin-coated onto glass/ITO/NiO x /PTAA/Al 2 O 3
substrate at 2,000 r.p.m. for 10 s and at 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. A 200 μl portion of CB was rapidly dripped onto the centre of the film at 5 s before the end of spin-coating. The as-prepared perovskite films were subsequently annealed on a hotplate at 100 °C for 60 min. Characterization of the solar cells The current density–voltage ( J–V ) characteristics of the devices were measured in ambient air (relative humidity was 40–50%) using an AM 1.5G solar simulator equipped with 450 W xenon lamp (Newport-2612A) and a Keithley 2400 SourceMeter. Light intensity was adjusted to AM 1.5G one sun (100 mW cm −2 ) with an NIM calibrated standard Si solar cell.
J–V
curves were measured in forward scan (from −0.1 to 1.2 V) and reverse scan (from 1.2 to −0.1 V). The active area of cells was defined to be 0.09 cm 2
or 1 cm 2
by a black metal mask. For incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency measurement, a Newport Instruments system (Newport-74125) coupled with a lock-in amplifier and a 300 W xenon lamp was employed. Characterization of the device stability The operational stability measurement of the unencapsulated devices was conducted under a continuous one-sun illumination (a light-emitting diode (LED) lamp without UV filter) at 55 ± 5 °C at MPP by using a MPP trace system (YH-VMPP-16) in a N 2 -filled glovebox for 1,500 h. According to the ISOS-T-1 standard, the stability measurement of the encapsulated devices was conducted at 85 °C and 85% RH in the constant temperature and humidity test chamber (HS-408L) for 1,200 h. The devices were encapsulated by UV adhesive (LT-U001, Lumtec) and a glass on top. As for
J–V
characterization, the PSCs were cooled to room temperature and measured by a Newport solar simulator (100 mW cm −2 ; 94023 A Oriel Sol3A, Class AAA) at AM 1.5G (calibrated via a standard silicon cell (Hamamatsu S1133)) and a Keithley 2420 SourceMeter (scan rate was 0.1 V s −1 ) at different time intervals. The devices used for damp-heat stability test were encapsulated. The devices were encapsulated in an N 2
atmosphere via a top glass and edge encapsulation of UV adhesive (LT-U001, Lumtec). The light spectrum of the LED lamp (Kaiyingerdun, 50 W, 5,000 K) and xenon lamp (Newport 94023A Oriel Sol3A, Class AAA) were used for MPP tracking and damp-heat stability tests, respectively (Supplementary Fig.
30 ). The top glass on the device was fixed by a tweezer and aligned with the edge of the device. Then, about 200 μl of UV adhesive was applied at the edge gap between the glass and the device. Finally, the UV adhesive was solidified by a UV curing process (XY2008-GHX-1) for 2 min. Scanning electron microscopy Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (JEOL JSM-7800F) was employed to characterize the cross-sectional and surface morphology of perovskite films. X-ray diffraction and UV–visible measurements The X-ray diffraction patterns were acquired using a Panalytical Empyrean diffractometer equipped with CuKα radiation ( λ  = 1.5406 Å). The UV–visible absorption spectra of perovskite films were measured using a Shimadzu UV3600 spectrophotometer. The change of light absorption during spin-coating of perovskite film was studied using self-made in situ light absorption equipment. Mott–Schottky measurements Mott–Schottky measurements (1,000 Hz) were carried out on a Chenhua electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E) under dark conditions. Photoluminescence measurements The steady-state PL spectra and TRPL spectra were measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (FLS1000, Edinburgh Instruments) with the excitation with a 405 nm laser pulsed at a frequency of 1 MHz and 500 KHz, respectively. Cryo-focused ion beam specimen preparation and STEM–EDS measurements The scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) specimen preparations were performed on an FEI Helios 5 dual-beam microscope equipped with a cryogenic system 42 . The bulk sample was placed on the cryo-stage and gradually cooled to about −140 °C by supplying liquid N 2 . After curing the organometallic precursor to form a Pt-C protective layer, a prism-shaped specimen was cut and transferred to a TEM grid. The subsequent sectioning was by fine milling and specimen transfer processes. The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF–STEM), EDS mapping and integrated differential phase contrast (iDPC)-STEM measurements were performed on a double Cs-corrected electron microscope (FEI Spectra 300) operated at 300 kV. The convergence semi-angle in the iDPC-STEM was 10.0 mrad. The probe current was about 1 pA. The dwell time was 5 µs per pixel, and the collection angle was 4–15 mrad. EDS analysis was performed using the high-efficient ‘Super X’ four-detector EDS detector. TOF-SIMS measurements The TOF-SIMS measurements (TOF-SIMS 5, IONTOF) were performed with the pulsed primary ions from an oxygen-ion beam (1 keV) for sputtering and a Bi +
pulsed primary ion beam for analysis (25 keV). GIWAXS measurements The GIWAXS data were obtained from BL1W1A of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility. UV photoelectron spectroscopy measurements UV photoelectron spectra were measured (Thermo Fisher Escalab 250Xi spectrometer) using a monochromatized Al source. The UV photoelectron spectra were calibrated using the work function of Au. TRS measurements TRS measurements were performed by a pump-probe spectrometer (TA-100, Time-Tech Spectra). A Ti:sapphire amplifier (Astrella, Coherent) was used to generate 800 nm light at 1 kHz repetition rate. The fundamental pulse was split into two parts. One part was sent to an optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS, light conversion) for the generation of various pump wavelengths at 1.65 eV, 2.1 eV and 2.6 eV. The pump was chopped at a frequency of 500 Hz and attenuated by neutral density filter wheels. The other part of the fundamental pulse was focused into a sapphire crystal to generate a visible continuum (450–810 nm) that was used as the probe. The probe pulses were delayed in time with respect to the pump pulses using a motorized translation stage mounted with a retroreflecting mirror. The pump and probe were spatially overlapped on the surface of the sample. For transient reflectance measurement, the incident angle for the pump was around 0° and for the probe was around 45°. The initial carrier density was of the order of 10 16  cm −3 . For transient reflection kinetics, the measured surface carrier kinetics can be modelled with a diffusion and surface recombination/transfer model. The carriers are generated with the profile $$\,N(x,0)={N}_{0}{\mathrm{e}}^{-\alpha x}\,$$
(1)
where
N 0
is the initial surface carrier density. If the traces are normalized, then
N 0
is equal to 1. The values for the absorption coefficient at different pump-photon energies for samples are known. The carrier movement obeys the diffusion and surface recombination/transfer equation: $$\frac{\partial N(x,t)}{\partial t}=D\frac{{\partial }^{2}N(x,t)}{\partial {x}^{2}}-\frac{N\left(x,t\right)}{{\tau }_{\mathrm{B}}}$$
(2)
$$\frac{\partial N(x,t)}{\partial t}{{\rm{|}}}_{x=0}=\frac{{S}_{\mathrm{F}}}{D}N\left(0,t\right)$$
(3)
$$\frac{\partial N(x,t)}{\partial t}{{\rm{|}}}_{x=L}=-\frac{{S}_{L}}{D}N\left(L,t\right)$$
(4)
where
N ( x ,  t ) is the carrier density as a function of depth ( x ) and time ( t ),
D
is the ambipolar diffusion coefficient and
τ B
is the bulk carrier lifetime. Generally, in perovskite material,
τ B
is of the order of hundreds of ns, and in the 5,000 ps probe window it can be neglected. The boundary condition can be described as follows. For the front surface, surface recombination/transfer will dominate ( S F ). For the back surface, surface recombination/transfer happens with
S L . For pure perovskites, the back surface and front surface can be assumed to have the same surface recombination velocity. For samples with HTL, the front surface transfer velocity is different from the back, where the back ( S L ) takes the value of pure perovskites.
L
is the thickness of the film. Time-resolved microwave conductivity measurements For time-resolved microwave conductivity measurements, the perovskite film samples were deposited on glass and excited with a fast nanosecond laser pulse (LO-TIS TII Nd:YAG Laser System LS-2145-OPO), which generated a certain amount of carriers within the sample. Subsequently, we probed the samples with a microwave and the reflected microwave intensity was monitored as a function of time following photo-excitation with a microwave analyser (N9915A FieldFox, Keysight). To enhance the sensitivity, we introduced a high-Q microwave cavity, which has a resonance frequency of ~4.3 GHz. The source power of the microwave was set at 1 mW, and the excitation laser wavelength was 530 nm with a pulse length of ~5 ns, repetition rate of 10 Hz and excitation fluence of ~0.3–30 µJ cm −2 , corresponding to a carrier density of 7.5 × 10 15 –7.5 × 10 17  cm −3 . Computational methods We used the open source code cp2k 52
to perform the density functional theory-based geometry optimization, Multiwfn was used to assist with the input file generation 53
and the PBE-D3 functional was used with double-zeta basis sets (DZVP-MOLOPT) and Goedecker–Teter–Hutter pseudopotentials 54
with an energy cutoff of 400 Ry. Local minimum-energy geometry was obtained until the total force was less than 4.5 × 10 −4  Ry. As a large enough simulation box was used, a single gamma point was chosen for all the calculations. The formation of the 2D perovskite was divided into three stages, namely: (1) formation of (FA) n −1 Pb n I 3 n −1
perovskite flakes by dissolved PbI 2
and FAI at the surface; (2) formation of ligand-assisted 2D perovskite L 2 (FA) n −1 Pb n I 3 n −1
(it should be noted that the ligand we used here was C 9 H 11 N · HCl; however, it is widely accepted that the Cl atom will not be incorporated into the crystal lattice but helps the perovskite crystallization in the intermediate compound, thus the C 9 H 11 N · HI iodine salt was used for calculation instead); (3) bulk 2D perovskite formation by way of stacking in the
z
direction via the van der Waals interactions. The formation energy of the three stages is illustrated in Supplementary Fig.
8a
and is defined as: $${{E}}_{{\rm{form}}}[{\rm{stage}}\,1]={E}[{{\rm{FA}}}_{{n}-1}{{\rm{Pb}}}_{{n}}{{\rm{I}}}_{{3n}-1}]-({n}-1){E}[{\rm{FAI}}]-{nE}[{{\rm{PbI}}}_{2}]$$ $${{E}}_{{\rm{form}}}[{\rm{stage}}\,2]={E}[{{\rm{L}}}_{2}{{\rm{FA}}}_{{n}-1}{{\rm{Pb}}}_{{n}}{{\rm{I}}}_{{3n}+1}]-{E}[{{\rm{FA}}}_{{n}-1}{{\rm{Pb}}}_{{n}}{{\rm{I}}}_{{3n}-1}]-{2E}[{\rm{LI}}]$$ $${{E}}_{{\rm{form}}}[{\rm{stage}}\,3]={E}[{\rm{bulk}}:\,{{\rm{L}}}_{2}{{\rm{FA}}}_{{n}-1}{{\rm{Pb}}}_{{n}}{{\rm{I}}}_{{3n}+1}]-{E}[{\rm{slab}}:\,{{\rm{L}}}_{2}{{\rm{FA}}}_{{n}-1}{{\rm{Pb}}}_{{n}}{{\rm{I}}}_{{3n}+1}]$$ The formation energy of each stage was calculated to investigate the 2D perovskite formation, and given that stage 3 should be the same for different numbers of layer
n , we ignored it. Supplementary Fig.
8b
shows the formation energy for different numbers of layer
n , and it was found that the formation energy of
n  = 2, 3, 4 and 5 was negative and decreases monotonically, which indicates that the energy is favourable to form the FA n −1 Pb n I 3 n −1
perovskite flakes. In contrast, the formation energy of
n  = 1 is positive, which means that it is difficult to form due to the non-favourable positive energy value. Therefore, in our case, the low-dimensional perovskites are easier to form for
n  ≥ 2 compared to
n  = 1. Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the
